Last Updated May 25, 2018. In a 10-year period, beginning in 1981, roughly 19,000 animals—from mice and rats to pigs—were killed in auto safety tests conducted by the General Motors Corporation (GM). This number was staggering to most Americans, who had no idea that live animals were used—and then disposed of—in automobile crash tests … that is, until PETA got involved.By September 1991, PETA had already begun a campaign against GM for its use of animals in crash tests. The first of dozens of planned protests against the car manufacturer took place at the auto show at the State Fair of Texas that year. Speaking to the media, we told the truth: Computer models and state-of-the-art dummies are the path to a safer future—not archaic, barbaric tests on animals.“People want a car that will accommodate a dog, not one that’s killed a dog. When consumers learn that animal cruelty is a built-in feature in GM cars, we think they’ll take their business elsewhere.” —Dan Mathews, PETA Senior Vice President of CampaignsWe called our campaign the “Heartbreak of America” (a play on GM’s slogan at the time) and kept pressure on the company for months on end. By early 1993, PETA members and conscientious consumers across the country had held protests at GM dealerships in at least 45 U.S. cities. We smashed GM cars outside auto shows in animal mascot outfits, and activists (including PETA’s founder and president, Ingrid Newkirk) were arrested when they blocked GM’s float during the annual Rose Parade in Pasadena, California, wearing colorful animal outfits—an event that landed on a Los Angeles Times list of the biggest controversies in Rose Parade history.© Patsy Lynch“In an age when computer models and state-of-the art dummies are the order of the day, they’re still killing innocent animals in the name of science. It’s like something out of the Dark Ages.”—Dan MathewsLater that year, after 18 months of hard-hitting PETA demonstrations speaking out against the use of live pigs and ferrets, GM officially confirmed that it had ended its use of animals in crash tests. Soon after, all other car manufacturers followed suit. Public pressure and superior science proved too much for these companies’ excuses, and countless animals were spared a violent, needless death.That was 1993. Now it’s 2018.\\xa0It’s time for all experiments on animals to end.It’s horrifying to look back now and imagine that animals were deliberately slammed into walls at high speeds in car-crash tests, yet without PETA’s campaign, the public may have remained in the dark for years as these twisted experiments continued.Today, we’re still attempting to shine a light into the darkest, deadliest laboratories where animals are suffering. Presently, at Texas A&M University, experimenters led by Joe Kornegay breed golden retrievers to develop canine muscular dystrophy (MD). This disease ravages their bodies, causing progressive muscle wasting and weakness. After 37 years, studies with these dogs haven’t led to a cure or even a treatment to reverse disease symptoms, yet they continue—despite growing pressure from PETA and other groups to move to modern, animal-free research methods.We can win this battle, too, with your help. Join us in urging Texas A&M to stop conducting MD experiments on dogs, stop breeding dogs, release those presently held for adoption into good homes, and, in the future, support only promising, modern, non-animal therapies.\"']\n"," ...\n"," ['139' '5'\n","  '\"An antitrust appMay 3, 2010 | 4:00amAfter years of being the little guy who used Washington to fend off Goliaths like Microsoft, Apple CEO Steve Jobs is about to learn what life is like when the shoe’s on the other foot.According to a person familiar with the matter, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are locked in negotiations over which of the watchdogs will begin an antitrust inquiry into Apple’s new policy of requiring software developers who devise applications for devices such as the iPhone and iPad to use only Apple’s programming tools.Regulators, this person said, are days away from making a decision about which agency will launch the inquiry. It will focus on whether the policy, which took effect last month, kills competition by forcing programmers to choose between developing apps that can run only on Apple gizmos or come up with apps that are platform neutral, and can be used on a variety of operating systems, such as those from rivals Google, Microsoft and Research In Motion.An inquiry doesn’t necessarily mean action will be taken against Apple, which argues the rule is in place to ensure the quality of the apps it sells to customers. Typically, regulators initiate inquiries to determine whether a full-fledged investigation ought to be launched. If the inquiry escalates to an investigation, the agency handling the matter would issue Apple a subpoena seeking information about the policy.Officials at both the Justice Department and FTC declined comment. Apple did not return calls seeking comment.The threat of Apple being the subject of an investigation would be a remarkable turnabout for a company that has long seen itself as being outside the establishment, and one that has egged on antitrust officials to blunt the momentum of larger rivals.However, thanks to the popularity of the iPod and iPhone, Apple is having a tough time continuing to play the role of David fighting against Goliath. Indeed, its market cap of $237.6 billion exceeds that of the world’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart, whose market cap is $201.7 billion.Apple put its might on full display last week when Jobs wrote a scathing explanation for why Adobe’s Flash programming language was unfit to be used on Apple products. The day his missive was released, Adobe shares fell 2 percent.In forcing computer programmers to choose developing an Apple-exclusive app over one that can be used on Apple and rival devices simultaneously, critics say Apple is hampering competition since the expense involved in creating an app will lead developers with limited budgets to focus on one format, not two. Generally, app developers are paid from a cut of the revenue generated when consumers buy the app.Shaun Meredith, a former Apple employee who runs software development company InfoBridge, said that as a result of Apple’s rule change, some of his customers are choosing to finance apps that are compatible with all of Apple’s competitors instead of those that work only with the iPhone or iPad.Indeed, though Apple has the most applications, it is a distant second in terms of operating system market share. According to comScore, RIM, which makes the BlackBerry, has a 42 percent share, while Apple’s take is 25 percent. Microsoft has 15 percent and Google’s Android software has 9 percent. josh.kosman@nypost.com\"']\n"," ['306' '3'\n","  '\"Yvon Chouinard: Save the Yellowstone Grizzly - The Cleanest Line        Photo: Florian SchulzBy        Patagonia      \\xa0\\xa0|    Sep 15, 2016    September 15, 2016          In the wake of the decision by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to delist the grizzly, the three states around Yellowstone have announced their intentions to sponsor trophy hunting of the bear.

Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, with great generosity, committed an additional nine million acres of federally owned land to create five new national parks—including Pumalín Park and Patagonia Park—and expand three others.Among those in attendance at the small protocol signing ceremony at Pumalín Park were Yvon and Malinda Chouinard, Rick and Jennifer Ridgeway, and Jimmy Chin. The crew had intended to visit Patagonia Park to climb the famed Cerro Kristine—named for Kris by her late husband and partner in conservation Doug—but found themselves rerouted at the last minute for the signing ceremony.Patagonia Park has been intertwined with Patagonia, Inc. for decades, from Yvon and Doug’s first trip to Patagonia in the 1960s to employees who volunteered to remove fences on old sheep ranches to filmmakers, runners and explorers who shared inspiring stories of the good work happening in Chile.At this pivotal moment, let’s take a\\xa0look back—to both the near and distant past—and reflect on the projects, people and campaigns that supported the largest park creation effort in our lifetime.

Condors and puma have rebounded, the endangered huemul deer is making a comeback and even more unimaginable success stories can be attributed to Kris and Doug and the creation of these parks.”—Malinda Chouinard, co-author of Family Business: Innovative On-Site Child Care Since 1983, March 2017            Yvon Chouinard and Kris Tompkins review the map of Patagonia Park.

To have these two juvenile delinquent/entrepreneur friends go on to create nearly 11 million acres of new national parks in Chile is a historical event without precedent. In comparison, Yellowstone National Park is only 2.3 million acres.”—Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, Inc., March 2017            Yvon Chouinard, Rick Ridgeway, Kris Tompkins, Jimmy Chin and Mikey Schaefer. Photo: Joanne Dornan          “Kris and her husband Doug have built this park using private donations and philanthropy. It reminded me of a sign that Doug used to have above his desk when he owned the woman’s apparel company Esprit.\\xa0It said, ‘Commit and then figure it out.’”—Rick Ridgeway, Vice President of Public Engagement for Patagonia, Inc., June 2015            Yvon and Doug during the filming of 180° South. Photo: Jeff Johnson          “After multiple ferry rides, two days driving on dirt roads, we have arrived at Estancia Valle Chacabuco, in remote Patagonia. Kris Tompkins, as part of the Patagonia Land Trust, purchased the former sheep and cattle ranch in 2004. Overgrazing had taken its toll on the land so all the farm animals have been relocated. The goal is to restore healthy soils and open wildlife corridors by removing the 450 miles of fence line that winds through the 170,000 acres of mountains and valleys. The Patagonia clothing company has a program that encourages its employees to volunteer three weeks of their time down here, pulling up fences, all expenses paid. Makohe, Keith, Yvon and I showed up just in time to put in our time as well.”—Jeff Johnson, excerpted from the book 180° South, May 2011            Patagonia employee volunteers celebrate a job well done. Photo: Nico Sala          “Our mission for the first half of our stay was to remove exotic plant species from one section of the park. Thistle, lamb’s ear, and Cicuta were our main targets. Their seeds tend to travel along the road, carried by livestock or vehicles. The purple thistle flowers and yellow lamb’s ear blooms were easy to spot, but it was the never-ending groves of tall, fibrous Cicuta that nearly broke us. You could spend an hour freeing a cluster of trees, only to round the corner to find another grove 20-feet wide.”—Colin Pile and Alison Kelman, Patagonia employees, May 2014            Old ranch fencing slated for removal by volunteers. Photo: Andy Mitchell          “That is where we spent the majority of the next three weeks, with views of Andean glaciers and ice fields. I expected we would spend some time pulling fence, but did not expect to be fully entrusted with long tracts for days at a time. We spent hours pulling and coiling wires, pulling pickets and posts, moving and piling everything. We got dirt under our fingernails, in our ears, in our hair, and down our backs. We got sunburned, bug bitten, and covered in burrs. We thrived on Nescafé, mutton and cheese sandwiches. We drank mate, vino, pisco and cervezas. Nights were filled with laughter and aching groans.”—Andy Mitchell, Patagonia employee, March 2007Luke Nelson during the filming of Mile for Mile—trail running and conservation in Patagonia. Photo: James Q Martin“The wind gusts, blowing spray from the water lapping on the banks of Lago General Carrera. Here I stand, eyes closed, feeling the cool mist on my sunburnt cheeks. When I open my eyes it’s still there, it feels like a dream, but it’s not—Patagonia spreads out all around me. I’ve long dreamt of seeing this place and now it’s blowing my mind. After imagining over and over what it would be like, how it would smell, how it would feel, it is far more than I had imagined it would be. The previous 39 hours have been a blur of driving, airports, flying, airports, loading gear, and more driving. But now it’s quiet, except for the sound of the wind blowing across the lake.”—Luke Nelson, Patagonia ambassador, December 2014Luke Nelson, Jeff Browning and Krissy Moehl tiptoe through the first of many frigid water crossings in Valle Hermoso during the filming of Mile for Mile. Photo: James Q Martin“This section was so spectacular that we couldn’t help yelling to each other “Look there!” or “Crazy!” or “I can’t believe this place!” Mountain running takes you to a lot of special, wild places, but this one was beyond words. I only hope to take my kids back there some day to see it.” —Jeff Browning, Patagonia ambassador, March 2015            Pumalín Park.

Amazon calls the service “Rekognition.”Marketing materials and documents obtained by ACLU affiliates in three states reveal a product that can be readily used to violate civil liberties and civil rights. Powered by artificial intelligence, Rekognition can identify, track, and analyze people in real time and recognize up to 100 people in a single image. It can quickly scan information it collects against databases featuring tens of millions of faces, according to Amazon.Amazon is marketing Rekognition for government surveillance. According to its marketing materials, it views deployment by law enforcement agencies as a “common use case” for this technology. Among other features, the company’s materials describe “person tracking” as an “easy and accurate” way to investigate and monitor people. Amazon says Rekognition can be used to identify “people of interest,” raising the possibility that those labeled suspicious by governments — such as undocumented immigrants or Black activists — will be seen as fair game for Rekognition surveillance. It also says Rekognition can monitor “all faces in group photos, crowded events, and public places such as airports,” at a time when Americans are joining public protests at unprecedented levels.Amazon’s Rekognition raises profound civil liberties and civil rights concerns. Today, the ACLU and a coalition of civil rights organizations demanded that Amazon stop allowing governments to use Rekognition.%3Ciframe%20allow%3D%22autoplay%3B%20encrypted-media%22%20allowfullscreen%3D%22%22%20frameborder%3D%220%22%20height%3D%22315%22%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FlSSZ3-ZIkHU%3Fautoplay%3D1%26version%3D3%22%20thumb%3D%22%2Ffiles%2F2018-05-23-amazon-rekognition-thumbnail-embed.jpg%22%20width%3D%22530%22%3E%3C%2Fiframe%3ETell Amazon to get out of the surveillance businessAmazon not only markets Rekognition as a law enforcement service, it is helping governments deploy it. Amazon lists the city of Orlando, Florida, and the Washington County Sheriff’s Office in Oregon among its customers. Upon learning this, the ACLU Foundations of California coordinated with the ACLU of Oregon and the ACLU of Florida on public records requests to learn more.The documents we obtained indicate that the Washington County sheriff and the city of Orlando became Rekognition customers in 2017. Washington County has since built a database of at least 300,000 mugshot photos to use in coordination with Rekognition. It also built a mobile app for its deputies to quickly scan for a match against the county’s database by submitting images obtained from surveillance or other sources.Amazon is providing company resources to help government agencies deploy Rekognition. In emails between Amazon and Washington County employees, the company offers the expertise of the Rekognition product team, troubleshoots problems encountered by the county, and provides “best practices” advice on how to deploy the service. In what Orlando’s police chief praises as a “first-of-its-kind public-private partnership,” Amazon promised free consulting services to build a Rekognition “proof of concept” for the city. Rekognition face surveillance is now operating across Orlando in real-time, according to Amazon, allowing the company to search for “people of interest” as footage rolls in from “cameras all over the city.”In the records, Amazon also solicits feedback and ideas for “potential enhancements” to Rekognition’s capabilities for governments. Washington County even signed a non-disclosure agreement created by Amazon to get “insight into the Rekognition roadmap” and provide additional feedback about the product. The county later cited this NDA to justify withholding documents in response to the ACLU’s public records request.The documents also revealed that Amazon offered to connect Washington County with other Amazon government customers interested in Rekognition — as well as a body camera manufacturer. Indeed, Amazon’s promotional materials previously recommended that law enforcement use Rekognition to identify people in police body camera footage. The company removed mention of police body cameras from its site after the ACLU raised concerns in discussions with Amazon. That appears to be the extent of its response to our concerns. This and other profoundly troubling surveillance practices are still permissible under the company’s policies.With Rekognition, a government can now build a system to automate the identification and tracking of anyone. If police body cameras, for example, were outfitted with facial recognition, devices intended for officer transparency and accountability would further transform into surveillance machines aimed at the public. With this technology, police would be able to determine who attends protests. ICE could seek to continuously monitor immigrants as they embark on new lives. Cities might routinely track their own residents, whether they have reason to suspect criminal activity or not. As with other surveillance technologies, these systems are certain to be disproportionately aimed at minority communities.Because of Rekognition’s capacity for abuse, we asked Washington County and Orlando for any records showing that their communities had been provided an opportunity to discuss the service before its acquisition. We also asked them about rules governing how the powerful surveillance system could be used and ensuring rights would be protected. Neither locality identified such records. In fact, Washington County began using Rekognition even as employees raised questions internally. In one email, a Washington County employee expressed the concern that the “ACLU might consider this the government getting in bed with big data.” That employee’s prediction was correct.People should be free to walk down the street without being watched by the government. By automating mass surveillance, facial recognition systems like Rekognition threaten this freedom, posing a particular threat to communities already unjustly targeted in the current political climate. Once powerful surveillance systems like these are built and deployed, the harm will be extremely difficult to undo.If Rekognition is not reined in, its use is also certain to spread. The records we obtained show that law enforcement agencies in California and Arizona have contacted Washington County asking about Rekognition. So have multiple “fusion centers,” which collect information about people for dissemination across agencies at the local and federal level.Amazon has publicly opposed secretive government surveillance. Its CEO, Jeff Bezos, has himself criticized Trump administration’s discriminatory Muslim ban. But actions speak louder than words, and Amazon’s efforts to deploy this technology run counter to its proclaimed values and risk harm to the company’s customers and their communities.\"']\n"," ['5' '1'\n","  '\"Fashion brand Zara once again associated with Brazilian labour rights abuses - SOMOZara does not have sufficient oversight of its supply chain. New findings of the Brazilian labour inspection, released by Repórter Brasil today, describe numerous labour rights violations in the company’s supply chain. A research report by SOMO and Repórter Brasil also released today reaches the same conclusion.In 2011, Brazilian inspectors found cases of modern-day slavery in Zara’s supply chain. After the scandal, Zara promised improvements by monitoring its supply chain more closely. The new inspection findings and the research report reveal that Zara is not living up to the agreements made with the Brazilian authorities at that time. In addition, the research report exposes Zara’s dodgy legal strategy to avoid liability for Brazilian labour rights abuses.Publication / May 1, 2015From moral responsibility to legal liability?Modern day slavery conditions in the global garment supply chain and the need to strengthen regulatory frameworksZara is one of the brands of Inditex, the world’s largest clothing retailer measured in number of stores. The company’s popularity stems from its unique ability to deliver the latest catwalk trends to its shops at affordable prices and at record speed. This is achieved not just by managing its own factories, but also by means of a large network of suppliers spread across several countries, who must be able to work fast and flexibly. To meet tight deadlines and to be able to complete unanticipated orders, manufacturers may subcontract certain production processes or even shift complete orders to other factories and workplaces, often without informing the buyer. This way of working has spawned an obscure supply chain which was revealed by Brazilian inspectors in 2011. They discovered that orders from Zara ended up at illegal workshops, where undocumented immigrants from Bolivia and Peru were working and living under inhumane conditions.Lack of compliance with agreementThese inspections are part of a package of measures that the Brazilian government has rolled out in order to detect and address modern-day slavery. After the inspections, Brazilian authorities reached an agreement with Zara in which the company committed itself to carry out better and more frequent supplier inspections in order to avoid infringements. The report by SOMO and Repórter Brasil reveals that Zara is still not monitoring its production chain sufficiently, and that the company is not living up to the reporting requirements specified in the agreement. This is confirmed by the recent report of the Brazilian labour inspection that Repórter Brasil had access to. According to this report sixty-seven suppliers were checked, and were found to be engaged in countless labour rights violations, such as excessive overtime and occupational health and safety violations.Irresponsible legal strategyTo make things worse, Zara is pursuing a legal strategy in Brazil that is potentially very harmful. The 2011 inspections put Zara at risk of entering the so-called ‘dirty list’ of Brazil’s labour and employment ministry – a registry of companies caught employing workers in conditions analogous to slavery. Zara pushed back by filing a law suit claiming that the list was unconstitutional. The company may purposely invalidate a very effective legal instrument with this defence strategy. In recent years, Brazil’s unique approach, combining inspections, prosecutions and making public the list of perpetrators, has rescued 45,000 people from situations that could accurately be described as modern-day slavery.According to SOMO and Repórter Brasil, this legal strategy is inconsistent with Zara’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy. Whereas Inditex promises customers decent conditions under which its products are manufactured, in court, the company argues that it cannot offer any guarantees.SOMO and Repórter Brasil’s report demonstrates that with the current structure of the garment supply chain it is indeed nearly impossible to assure that products are made under decent conditions. However, companies such as Zara, who benefit from the way the supply chain is structured, should not be allowed to dodge their responsibilities. SOMO and Repórter Brasil argue that corporations with such strong purchasing power, and that pressure for low prices and tight delivery deadlines, are in fact contributing to human rights abuses. Precisely for this reason they should be held liable for human rights violations in their production chains. Supply chain liability is nothing more than a legal basis to hold companies to account for what fashion companies like Zara say they are already doing: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights violations. The organisations also call on the Brazilian government to strengthen the legal basis of the dirty list so that it can withstand attacks by companies such as Zara.Read the news article on the website of Repórter Brasil: ‘Zara corta oficinas de imigrantes e será multada por discriminação‘ (Portuguese only).Sign upStay up-to-date with SOMOs Newsletter\"']]\n","Converting to features started.

So our oceans keep suffering—and not just from high-profile spills like Santa Barbara in 1969, the Deepwater Horizon in 2010, and Refugio in 2015. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, “thousands of oil spills occur in U.S. waters each year,” and there have been 44 spills over 10,000 barrels each since the Santa Barbara catastrophe first brought offshore oil into the public eye.            Spilled crude at the waterline on Refugio State Beach in Southern California. In May 2015, a ruptured oil pipe dumped over 140,000 gallons of oil with the slick spreading along seven miles of the Gaviota Coast. Hundreds of birds and marine mammals were killed, commercial fisheries were shut down for weeks, and the surf break at Refugio State Park was closed for months. Photo: Paul Wellman          Now, despite the inarguable risks, the Trump administration is trying to open almost all of America’s coastline to drilling and exploration. The administration’s draft proposal was to “make more than 98 percent of the offshore continental shelf available,” and “allows for unprecedented access to America’s extensive offshore oil and gas resources.” It’s a radical and potentially disastrous plan that must be resisted by everyone who cares about America’s coasts, oceans and climate—especially those of us who want to keep on riding waves.“This is going to pollute the ocean and put our breaks at risk,” notes Pete Stauffer, the environmental director of the Surfrider Foundation. “Expanded drilling will also industrialize our coastlines and threaten\\xa0coastal communities, economies and livelihoods. As surfers, we need to speak out against the federal government’s dangerous plans—the ocean is a public resource, and our leaders are required to consider\\xa0the public’s\\xa0input.”            Surfers paddle out en masse to protest Equinor’s deepwater drilling plans in the Great Australian Bight. Torquay, Australia. Photo: Ed Sloane          It’s not just an American issue, either—the global climate knows no borders, and neither do the ocean’s storms, swells and currents. Our friends Down Under are among the many surfers and activists standing up to Big Oil around the world, as a Norwegian company called Equinor tries to turn the Great Australian Bight into an oil field. The Bight is one of our planet’s last great tracts of marine wilderness, and the company’s own spill modeling shows the potential of oil washing up on the entire length of the South Australian coastline, not to mention the damage to water quality and wildlife offshore. Like the Trump proposal, drilling in Australia’s offshore waters is too dangerous to accept, and you can learn more about the Fight for the Bight here.    Stop New Offshore Drilling  Whether it’s America, Australia or anywhere else on our shared planet, what we do now will determine the future of our oceans, and there’s simply no time to lose. Patagonia is supporting Surfrider in its campaign to stop new offshore drilling, and you can help stop President Trump’s plan before it’s too late.

They were denied any opportunity to set foot outdoors.Eventually, female calves are inseminated—just like their mothers—and exploited for their milk. After their bodies wear out from the constant cycle of pregnancy and lactation, cows used in the dairy industry are shipped off to be slaughtered—the same terrifying fate that male calves face.Calves who were separated from their mothers shortly after birth had to lie in their own manure and urine, day after day, unable even to set foot on the grass outdoors.Lame Mother Cows Left to Lie in Manure, Milked Daily for CashInjured and ailing cows were put in what was called the “outback barn,” which was full of accumulated feces and urine. Allowing wounded cows to lie in such filth can cause arthritis and severe lameness. Cows at Reitz Dairy Farm limped along gingerly on floors slick with waste, including in the very room where the milk that they had produced for their calves was taken from them to be sold and made into cheese.One cow, named Caroline by PETA’s eyewitness, developed painful lameness and favored one of her hooves. Her condition worsened, but the farm manager didn’t provide her with any care. Instead, she was put in a pen full of manure—which could cause deep foot infections, abscesses, disease, and more. Eventually, PETA’s eyewitness found her dead.Caroline was lame and left to lie in feces and urine. Weeks later, she was found dead in a barn stall.Cows Repeatedly Kicked and Beaten With a Cane—Even on their UddersOne cow became trapped in a stall after being milked. Rather than helping to free her, a worker hit her on the hindquarters, legs, and udder nearly 60 times with a hard cane—deliberately targeting her sensitive udder. He also kicked her over and over again.He repeatedly struck another cow on her delicate udder, too, even though she had just given birth and her newborn had just been torn away from her.Daisy was denied care for her swollen hocks, one of which was as large as a grapefruit.Denied Care for Swollen, Ruptured Leg Joints Leaking Pus and BloodMany cows’ leg joints were severely swollen—a painful condition that can be caused by trauma (like being struck or jabbed) or by constantly lying in filthy stalls with no bedding, like those at Reitz Dairy Farm, where cows tried to rest when not being milked. One veterinary expert who reviewed the eyewitness footage said, “The excessive waste accumulation and harsh, abrasive concrete stalls without bedding is causing and exacerbating injury and illness in the animals.”PETA’s eyewitness found that the left hind leg joint—or “hock”—of a cow he named Anna was inflamed and larger than a grapefruit. When asked if she would be provided with veterinary care, the farm manager replied, “Not for swollen hocks.” Week after week, Anna’s painful hock grew larger and larger, until finally it burst—leaving blood and pus running down her leg.Like Anna, Daisy—and many other cows—were given no care for their swollen, inflamed hocks, some of which were open and oozing blood or a thick yellow discharge.Approximately 60% of the cows who were being milked had leg joints that were swollen, ulcerated, or missing hair. Anna, Daisy, and others endured these painful injuries week after week—but were still hooked up to machines that took their milk for human consumption every day.Many cows’ leg joints were inflamed, raw, bleeding, and oozing pus.A Painful Eye, a Perforated Teat, and More—but no Vet CareThe left eye socket of another cow, named Betsy by PETA’s eyewitness, was covered with protruding tissue and secreted fluid, which an expert stated is “is indicative of eye irritation and pain.” Still, the farm manager indicated that nothing would be done for her.Other cows had wounds on their sensitive udders or teats.Milk leaked from a hole in one cow’s teats, increasing her risk of mastitis, a painful infection of the udder common in cows used for their milk.When they were not being milked, cows lay in their own waste, increasing their risk of developing infections that lead to pus in milk sold for human consumption.“The worst problems shown on this video were the swollen hocks. One was almost the size of a basketball. These are some of the WORST hocks I have ever seen. These cows would definitely be suffering. It is obvious that the farmer was not taking steps to prevent swollen hocks. Some of these cows should have been culled before they deteriorated to such poor conditions. This is a poorly managed dairy where cows were suffering.” —World-renowned meat- and dairy-industry expert Dr. Temple GrandinBetsy’s left eye socket was covered with protruding tissue and caused her pain. Nothing was done for her condition.The Long History of Cruelty at Reitz Dairy FarmThis isn’t the first time that cows have been found suffering at this farm. In 2009, PETA documented that cows who were in so much pain that they couldn’t even stand up were electro-shocked, kicked, or jabbed with a blade. Some were left to deteriorate until they were too weak to stand up, and downed cows were just left for dead.In the years since, worker after worker from the farm has blown the whistle about the neglect, abuse, and filth at Reitz Dairy Farm—which has shocked even those who have long worked in the dairy industry. One whistleblower reported that farm owner Lloyd Reitz Sr. and his son, Andy Reitz, slit conscious cows’ throats, made cows lie in their own waste, left sick and injured cows untreated, and more.What You Can DoThis exposé spotlights just one farm and reveals only some of the routine cruelty in the dairy industry. Cows carry their young for nine months—just like humans—and produce milk for their own babies. But on every dairy farm, their calves are taken away from them shortly after birth, and their milk is sold for human consumption. The surest way to spare cows and calves all this pain and misery is to stop buying cheese and other dairy “products” and go vegan today.If you think you have what it takes to carry out eyewitness investigations like this one, we want to hear from you. Click here to share your gratitude with the eyewitness who revealed the cruelty at this farm.Finally, please urge the National Farmers Organization to reconsider whether it and its customers want to continue being affiliated with suffering and filth such as that documented at Reitz Dairy Farm.

Photo: Government of ChileBy        Patagonia      \\xa0\\xa0|    May 18, 2017    May 18, 2017          In March, we celebrated the incredible accomplishment of Kris and Doug Tompkins: a one million acre pledged donation of parkland to the Government of Chile, the largest land donation in history from a private entity to a country. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, with great generosity, committed an additional nine million acres of federally owned land to create five new national parks—including Pumalín Park and Patagonia Park—and expand three others.Among those in attendance at the small protocol signing ceremony at Pumalín Park were Yvon and Malinda Chouinard, Rick and Jennifer Ridgeway, and Jimmy Chin. The crew had intended to visit Patagonia Park to climb the famed Cerro Kristine—named for Kris by her late husband and partner in conservation Doug—but found themselves rerouted at the last minute for the signing ceremony.Patagonia Park has been intertwined with Patagonia, Inc. for decades, from Yvon and Doug’s first trip to Patagonia in the 1960s to employees who volunteered to remove fences on old sheep ranches to filmmakers, runners and explorers who shared inspiring stories of the good work happening in Chile.At this pivotal moment, let’s take a\\xa0look back—to both the near and distant past—and reflect on the projects, people and campaigns that supported the largest park creation effort in our lifetime.            Kris Tompkins address the crowd at the signing ceremony. Photo: Jimmy Chin          “There were 150 of us—team members, high government officials, our delegation from Ventura and, standing at attention, the local fire department—all grouped in a semicircle at the Pumalín Park headquarters. When Kris and President Bachelet appeared walking hand in hand down the road to the signing there wasn’t a dry eye in the group, including me, and I never cry!”—Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, Inc., March 2017            Celebrating a historic day in Chile. Photo: Government of Chile          “This represents an enormous milestone for Kris, who, alongside her late husband Doug Tompkins, has worked for more than two decades to protect some of the most ecologically diverse and stunningly beautiful landscapes in the world from development so future generations can continue to enjoy the pristine nature of the Patagonia region of Chile and Argentina. The Tompkins’s tenacity and passion is a major inspiration for us all as our company continues to fight for the protection of Bears Ears and other public lands here in the United States, as well as conservation efforts in every corner of the world.”—Rose Marcario, CEO of Patagonia, Inc., March 2017            Guanaco in Valle Chacabuco. Photo: Colin Pile          “When first we started thinking about Valle Chacabuco becoming a national park, it was overrun and overgrazed from years of sheep ranching. Since then, volunteers from around the world have removed over 400 miles of fencing so native guanaco can have the freedom to roam. Condors and puma have rebounded, the endangered huemul deer is making a comeback and even more unimaginable success stories can be attributed to Kris and Doug and the creation of these parks.”—Malinda Chouinard, co-author of Family Business: Innovative On-Site Child Care Since 1983, March 2017            Yvon Chouinard and Kris Tompkins review the map of Patagonia Park. Photo: Jimmy Chin          “I was so proud of Kris, as I’ve known her since she was a teenage surfer girl living next door at Mondos Beach. She was our CEO at Patagonia during the very early high-growth tumultuous years. Doug I’ve known since he was a school dropout at 15, learning to climb in the Shawangunks with our vulgarian friends. To have these two juvenile delinquent/entrepreneur friends go on to create nearly 11 million acres of new national parks in Chile is a historical event without precedent. In comparison, Yellowstone National Park is only 2.3 million acres.”—Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, Inc., March 2017            Yvon Chouinard, Rick Ridgeway, Kris Tompkins, Jimmy Chin and Mikey Schaefer.

It reminded me of a sign that Doug used to have above his desk when he owned the woman’s apparel company Esprit.\\xa0It said, ‘Commit and then figure it out.’”—Rick Ridgeway, Vice President of Public Engagement for Patagonia, Inc., June 2015            Yvon and Doug during the filming of 180° South. Photo: Jeff Johnson          “After multiple ferry rides, two days driving on dirt roads, we have arrived at Estancia Valle Chacabuco, in remote Patagonia. Kris Tompkins, as part of the Patagonia Land Trust, purchased the former sheep and cattle ranch in 2004. Overgrazing had taken its toll on the land so all the farm animals have been relocated. The goal is to restore healthy soils and open wildlife corridors by removing the 450 miles of fence line that winds through the 170,000 acres of mountains and valleys. The Patagonia clothing company has a program that encourages its employees to volunteer three weeks of their time down here, pulling up fences, all expenses paid. Makohe, Keith, Yvon and I showed up just in time to put in our time as well.”—Jeff Johnson, excerpted from the book 180° South, May 2011            Patagonia employee volunteers celebrate a job well done. Photo: Nico Sala          “Our mission for the first half of our stay was to remove exotic plant species from one section of the park. Thistle, lamb’s ear, and Cicuta were our main targets. Their seeds tend to travel along the road, carried by livestock or vehicles. The purple thistle flowers and yellow lamb’s ear blooms were easy to spot, but it was the never-ending groves of tall, fibrous Cicuta that nearly broke us. You could spend an hour freeing a cluster of trees, only to round the corner to find another grove 20-feet wide.”—Colin Pile and Alison Kelman, Patagonia employees, May 2014            Old ranch fencing slated for removal by volunteers. Photo: Andy Mitchell          “That is where we spent the majority of the next three weeks, with views of Andean glaciers and ice fields. I expected we would spend some time pulling fence, but did not expect to be fully entrusted with long tracts for days at a time. We spent hours pulling and coiling wires, pulling pickets and posts, moving and piling everything. We got dirt under our fingernails, in our ears, in our hair, and down our backs. We got sunburned, bug bitten, and covered in burrs. We thrived on Nescafé, mutton and cheese sandwiches. We drank mate, vino, pisco and cervezas. Nights were filled with laughter and aching groans.”—Andy Mitchell, Patagonia employee, March 2007Luke Nelson during the filming of Mile for Mile—trail running and conservation in Patagonia.

When I open my eyes it’s still there, it feels like a dream, but it’s not—Patagonia spreads out all around me. I’ve long dreamt of seeing this place and now it’s blowing my mind. After imagining over and over what it would be like, how it would smell, how it would feel, it is far more than I had imagined it would be. The previous 39 hours have been a blur of driving, airports, flying, airports, loading gear, and more driving. But now it’s quiet, except for the sound of the wind blowing across the lake.”—Luke Nelson, Patagonia ambassador, December 2014Luke Nelson, Jeff Browning and Krissy Moehl tiptoe through the first of many frigid water crossings in Valle Hermoso during the filming of Mile for Mile.

Six months of exclusive breastfeeding are said to increase a child\\'s chance of survival by six times.Still, third world women yearned for Westernization.Flickr / x-ray delta onePoor women longed to move from a rural to an urban way of life, which prodded them to abandon breastfeeding and in turn primed them for marketing, said War on Want:\"\"As the social position of women changes and they go out to earn a wage ... looking at the breast as a cosmetic sex symbol rather than a source of nourishment reinforces the trend.\"\"War on Want said this undermined women\\'s confidence in breastfeeding.Playing into undernourished women\\'s fear of harming their newborn was a \"\"confidence trick,\"\" said War on Want. When these women felt fear, pain or sadness, their milk would dry up as a result.The \"\"letdown reflex, which controls the flow of milk to the mother\\'s nipple is a nervous mechanism,\"\" the paper said. \"\"Somehow mothers are deciding that a bottle is necessary to the milk she provides ... some mothers may even become so concerned about not having enough milk that they will not have enough.\"\"Hospitals were also accused of pushing mothers to use formula.This worked on two levels, said New Internationalist: In exchange for handing out \"\"discharge packs\"\" of formula, hospitals received freebies like formula and baby bottles.\"\"The most insidious of these is a free architectural service to hospitals which are building or renovating facilities for newborn care,\"\" the authors wrote.Beyond that, the authors said \"\"baby milk companies spend untold millions of dollars subsidizing office furnishings, research projects, gifts, conferences, publications and travel junkets of the medical profession.\"\"Meanwhile in the Third World, women tried to save money by diluting the formula.Formulas had to be mixed with water, but Third World mothers didn\\'t understand that overdilluting it—especially with contaminated water—could \"\"prevent a child from absorbing the nutrients in food and lead to malnutrition,\"\" said War on Want.A New York Times\\' article on the scandal said one Jamaican family\\'s income \"\"averaged only $7 a week,\"\" leading the mother to dilute the water with as much as three times the recommended amount of water so she could feed two children.Millions of babies died from malnutrition.\"\"The results can be seen in the clinics and hospitals, the slums and graveyards of the Third World,\"\" said War on Want. \"\"Children whose bodies have wasted away until all that is left is a big head on top of the shriveled body of an old man.\"\"In the Times, United States Agency for International Development official, Dr. Stephen Joseph, blamed reliance on baby formula for a million infant deaths every year through malnutrition and diarrheal diseases.It also hindered infant growth in general, said War on Want. Citing \"\"complex links emerging between breast feeding and emotional and physical development,\"\" the group said breastfed children walked \"\"significantly better than bottle-fed\"\" kids, and were more emotionally advanced.Nestlé sued a War On Want publisher for libel in 1974.GettyNestlé wasn\\'t about to take these allegations lying down. It sued a German translator of War on Want\\'s exposé, which published it in Sweden with the title, \"\"Nestlé Kills Babies.\"\"Nestlé won the suit in 1976, said Baby Milk Action , but with a caveat: The judge urged them to \"\"modify its publicity methods fundamentally.\"\" Time Magazine declared this a \"\"moral victory\"\" for consumers.The bad publicity sparked a global boycott of Nestlé.Infant Formula Action Coalition launched a boycott in the U.S. protesting Nestlé. Soon it spread to France, Finland and Norway and countless other countries.\"\"I remember my mother telling me about this and in 1980, she refused to buy candy bars because we heard of so many kids dying in the news stories,\"\" said Harrigan.The boycott was suspended in 1984, but resurfaced in the late 1980s when Ireland, Australia, Mexico, Sweden and the U.K. adopted it.Source: Baby Milk ActionThe International Code of Marketing Breast-Milk Substitutes was created in 1981.In 1978, Senator Edward Kennedy held a series of U.S. Senate Hearings on the industry\\'s unethical marketing practices.

Where’s your emergency?Caller: Hi, I’m at 500 Duke Drive in Lebanon, so it’s the Amazon building. I’ve got an associate threatening suicide, she has very specific plans and has shown scratches more than anything on her arms but she’s trying to leave the building. She needs medical help, we can’t keep her here.Operator: Police dispatchCaller: Yes, hi, I wanted to see if we could get an officer out to the Amazon facility. I have an associate who had written a suicide letter to her children that was discovered on her today.Caller: Hey this is Chris, loss prevention Amazon. How you doing?Operator: Good how are you?Caller: Not too bad, I need EMS to start our way please. I have a suicidal employee in one of our offices, he attempted to cut himself three or four times tonight. And he is willing to go with EMS.Operator: OK, what did he attempt to cut himself with?Caller: One of our safety box cutters.Dozens and dozens of times over five years, calls were made from Amazon warehouses to 911 dispatchers about men and women on the brink.There was the suicidal employee in Hebron, Kentucky, who police said “is pregnant and threatening the baby” in December 2016. The 22-year-old woman in Joliet, Illinois, who said she wanted to “stab herself in the stomach” that same month. And the young man who threatened to “jump from [the] second floor” of the warehouse in Chester, Virginia, in January 2015.Between October 2013 and October 2018, emergency workers were summoned to Amazon warehouses at least 189 times for suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, and other mental-health episodes, according to 911 call logs, ambulance and police reports reviewed and analyzed by The Daily Beast.The reports came from 46 warehouses in 17 states—roughly a quarter of the sorting and fulfillment centers that comprise the company’s U.S. network. Jurisdictions for other Amazon warehouses either did not have any suicide reports or declined requests for similar logs.National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255)Amazon, founded by the now-richest man in the world, has long faced criticism about working conditions at its warehouses: the high-pressure pace, the stultifying boredom, the timed bathroom breaks, and the digital surveillance that monitors performance.The 911 calls and police reports collected through open-record requests are not evidence that Amazon staffers experience suicidal episodes more often than other American workers, in or out of a warehouse—but they do offer a visceral, real-time glimpse of employees on the edge.• In Jacksonville, Florida, in December 2017, an older woman said “she was going to go home and kill herself” because she was being fired, according to a sheriff’s report. A supervisor saw her crying and hitting her head against a wall a couple times because she was being dismissed, and “did not have anything to live for.” She told a sheriff’s officer that she planned to cut her wrist with a butter knife, and previously had suicidal thoughts.• In June 2018, police officers were sent to a warehouse in Shakopee, Minnesota, to help with a suicidal employee. The officers found the woman crying in the first aid office where she admitted that she wanted to kill herself, the police report says. “She mentioned wanting to use box cutters,” police wrote.• At a warehouse in Etna, Ohio, in July 2018, a young man said, “With all the demands his employer has placed on him and things he\\'s dealing with in life [sic] is becoming too much and considering hurting himself,” a sheriff’s report says. The worker has been “with Amazon for over a year and is frustrated with his employment because he felt he was lied to by Amazon at his orientation. He keeps saying the company told him they valued his employment and would be treated as if he mattered and not just a number,” the report adds.“It’s this isolating colony of hell where people having breakdowns is a regular occurrence,” said Jace Crouch, a former employee at a warehouse in Lakeland, Florida, who had an emotional crisis on the job. It’s “mentally taxing to do the same task super fast for 10-hour shifts, four or five days a week.”Some employees told The Daily Beast that they struggled with mental health issues before they began working for Amazon. But they believed the exacting work environment made them worse. And in some cases, after they were put on leave, they said they struggled to obtain promised compensation, received counseling they found insufficient or unaffordable, or were even fired.In a statement to The Daily Beast, Amazon said it values the health of its employees and suggested that the number of calls is an “overgeneralization” that “doesn’t take into account the total of our associate population, hours worked, or our growing network.”“The physical and mental well-being of our associates is our top priority, and we are proud of both our efforts and overall success in this area,” the statement said.“We provide comprehensive medical care starting on day one so employees have access to the care when they need it most, 24-hour a day free and confidential counseling services, and various leave and medical accommodation options covering both mental and physical health concerns.”“Crack the whip, crack the whip”The bins came one after another.It was Nick Veasley’s job to count the items in each one and check the tally against a computer screen to make sure it matched Amazon’s inventory. As soon as he was done, a robot would place another bin in front him—and that’s how it went all night at the warehouse in Etna, Ohio.Sometimes Veasley, 41, had to hop up a stepstool to count. sometimes he had to bend over, aggravating his knees and back. Either way, he had to count fast—hundreds of pieces an hour—or a manager tracking his progress in real time would prod him to hurry up. He only occasionally talked to coworkers, knowing a supervisor could track the impromptu break, and the warehouse was nearly silent, aside from the shuffling feet of coworkers and the sliding of bins.The work was at once stressful and boring, so Veasley’s mind wandered: to the water and electric bills he couldn’t pay, the rent checks he owed, to the fiancée and daughter who depended on him. On Saturday, Feb. 10, 2018, his thoughts took a dark turn: Killing himself might be a way out, from his problems and what he saw as the relentless pressure of his job.It wasn’t the first time Veasley had thought about suicide. On his way to work that night, according to a police report, he’d wanted to drive his car off a cliff.When Veasley started working at Amazon in December 2016, he said, he was thrilled to land the $14.50-an-hour job. “The job was a big deal,” he said. “It was good money, good benefits.”But standing on his feet all day took a toll. His ankle started to hurt—badly. In February 2017 he went on medical leave for surgery, Amazon said. A snafu with the third party handling his paperwork cost him thousands in income, he said, and he fell behind on his bills. (Amazon disputes this, saying he was paid for his leave.)“They were wanting money and things started getting shut off,” he said. “I was getting three-day notices on my door and my landlord saying pay this or get out.”That’s when Veasley first began having suicidal thoughts. After he returned to Amazon in August 2017, it only got worse. The isolation, boredom, stress, and effort to recover leave pay plunged him deeper into depression, he said.“I had so much on my mind that the quietness of standing in one spot and doing my job, would just let my mind run,” he said.When Veasley spoke to human resources about how he was feeling, they seemed compassionate, he said. He was allowed to take a two-month leave, which came with a reduction in pay.His second return to work, that winter, was no easier. “The quota, the boringness, everything,” he said. Managers, he said, acted as enforcers. “Do that, do this, do this,” he said. “Crack the whip, crack the whip, crack the whip.”Another pressure point: Veasley suffers from irritable bowel syndrome and an intestinal disease called diverticulitis, which he said forced him to take frequent bathroom breaks to relieve pain.He received two write-ups and was told that another violation could result in suspension or termination, he said. (Amazon called his account “highly unlikely,” saying managers work with HR to have a thorough conversation about “barriers” that lead associates to “accrue time off task.”) “Usually I can get myself out of a problem but I couldn’t do it working at Amazon,” Veasley said. “I felt like I had a thousand pounds wrapped around my ankle and it kept dragging me down and down and down, and there was no way out.”After he told a guard about wanting to drive his car off a cliff, police were called and Veasley was taken to nearby Licking Memorial Hospital and then psychiatric ward, where he spent three days, he said. He blames Amazon for the ordeal.“That place screwed me up so much it put me into a depression where I was actually on a 72-hour hold in a psych ward,” he said.Amazon said it was “unfortunate” that Veasley feels that way. “Many employees will tell you they love their jobs and working in fulfillment centers,” it said in a statement.It said performance goals are standard in the industry and that “we support people who are not performing to the levels expected with dedicated coaching to help them improve.”“As we would with any associate in need, we supported and attempted to help Nick get the treatment and support he needed and requested. We accommodated his requests, directly engaged with him to understand his needs, provided resources, including outside and emergent crisis intervention help to him. Even though in the end it did not work out for Nick at Amazon, we hope he has found success in his pursuits,” Amazon added.“They treat us like robots”Caller: Hi this is Greg, Loss Prevention Specialist with Amazon, calling to report that we have a suicidal person...Operator: OK what’s he said that’s made him suicidal?Caller: His initial utterance is that he’d had thoughts of killing himself, he’s expressed two different plans that crossed his mind. One would be to go to a second or third story and throw himself off a balcony and he has also attempted and or thought of a plan of cutting his wrists.The Daily Beast spoke to six current or former Amazon employees who had mental-health crises that required emergency assistance at the warehouse. They said much of their at-work stress stemmed from the performance quota.A former employee in Etna, Ohio, said that it was sometimes physically impossible to stay on pace. “Even if it isn’t your fault, they ignore any explanation that you could give.”He was constantly fearful that he would receive citations for falling short. “Once you have enough write-ups, you’re out the door,” he said. “There goes your livelihood.”“There was a constant sense of, ‘did I screw that up, did I screw that up, did I screw that up?” he said. “[It] stays with you and almost becomes a permanent anxiety.”“They treat us like robots,” said another employee, who was on leave after making a threat of suicide at a warehouse in Lebanon, Tennessee.Some workers cited a stringent break policy. Managers flagged any lull in performance longer than a handful of minutes, Veasley said. Former employees who worked 12-hour shifts said they received two 30-minute breaks and a 15-minute break. But just walking across the massive warehouse ate up chunks of free time.Crouch said he has struggled with depression for much of his life, which continued at Amazon. “It made it really hard for me to deal with that dehumanization at work,” he said. “I would come home, not talk to anyone, sit in bed, and cry.”To be sure, not all the incidents at Amazon facilities were triggered by work-related issues.A young woman who worked at the Jacksonville warehouse told a co-worker in February 2018 that she was suicidal over the loss of a friend.An employee who had “multiple thoughts of killing himself throughout the day,” according to an August 2015 police report in Lakeland, told The Daily Beast that “nothing about Amazon was stressing me out.”In some cases, emergency workers were called to Amazon facilities for people who were not workers. In September 2016, police went to a warehouse in Bellevue, Washington, to assist with an employee’s suicidal fiancée, who had used a saw to cut her leg, according to police.“They need to interact to feel human”The details in the emergency calls and police reports follow a long series of reports about conditions in Amazon warehouses that can only be described as hellish.A British journalist who went undercover described a clock-watching culture so extreme that some employees urinated in bottles rather than trek to restrooms and risk being marked AWOL—which Amazon denies.Amazon retrofit warehouses with air conditioning after a Pennsylvania newspaper reported in 2011 that temperatures at one facility would reach 100 degrees and that paramedics were stationed outside during heat waves.The company’s anti-theft and security screening procedures mean long lines before some workers can clock in. A lawsuit over the unpaid waiting time ended up before the U.S. Supreme Court, which sided with Amazon.There are myriad reports of workers being injured on the job. Two dozen employees were hospitalized last year when a can of bear repellent spewed toxic fumes in a warehouse. it was at least the third such incident in three years.Scholars and researchers who study the effect of work on mental health declined to discuss Amazon’s employment practices. But many of the conditions cited by Amazon workers with suicide incidents were mentioned by the experts, who said a pressure cooker environment and mental illness can be dangerously toxic combination.“High levels of workplace stressors can be bad for pre-existing mental-health conditions and can exacerbate them,” said Naomi Swanson, a lead researcher at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, adding that research in the area was scarce.A workplace that asks a lot from employees but does not offer leeway in how they complete their tasks can be unhealthy.“If you’re doing something that is just too hard for you, you can’t do it worried about your performance. That would be stressful, leading to mood disorders and anxiety disorders,” said William Eaton, a professor at the Johns Hopkins’ school of public health.Working in social isolation is another red flag. People need social contact, said Ron Goetzel, another Johns Hopkins professor. “They need to interact to feel human.”But researchers also agree that mental-health disorders and suicidal behavior are complex.“You’ve got individuals who experience stress from a variety of sources,” said Yeates Conwell, a professor at the University of Rochester Center for Study and Prevention of Suicide. “The workplace may be one in which those things come together and get expressed as stress, mental illness, suicidal ideation behavior.”“He started going into a dark place”Like Nick Veasley, Jonathan Forrest was elated when Amazon offered him a job in the same warehouse. “Half nervous but mostly excited to start a new journey in life!” Forrest, then 36, posted on Facebook in the fall of 2016.He was a picker, charged with putting items in bins.“The board at Amazon showed the top 10 pickers of my shift and of well over 100 pickers, I ranked #8,” he wrote on Facebook a few weeks after he began. “At least there’s 1 thing to make me feel proud of myself.”At $17.50 per hour, Forrest was making more money than he ever did before, and was paying down $7,000 in veterinary school debt, his father Butch Forrest said. But a few months in, he began to sour on his job and the company.“I would like to thank one of the worlds [sic] richest men, multi billionaire Jeff Bezos, for the opportunity to win this overly generous $1 vending machine coupon to use in the Amazon cafeteria as a reward for my hard work today,” Forrest posted in late-January of 2017. “I’m confident that the free snickers bar I consume tomorrow will help further compel me to keep being the best picker that I can be!”In April, he posted: “After this next week is over, I will have worked 280 hours in 5 weeks...I am ready to stop, take some time to enjoy myself and not work so much, what does my work do????? Mandatory fucking overtime! Seriously???? I am so pissed off right now.” It ended with this plea: “Leave me alone Amazon.”“He started going into a dark place,” said Donnie Sanford, a close friend.That summer, Forrest mentioned having suicidal thoughts to a coworker at Amazon and qualified for medical leave, his father said. Forrest saw a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with bipolar disorder and prescribed medication, according to documents reviewed by The Daily Beast.Forrest returned to work after about a month, his father said, but on Oct. 28, he made another suicidal comment at work. This time an Amazon employee called the police. “Jonathan stated that he has had thoughts of suicide or self harm for several years and that the thoughts have been escalating in recent weeks,” a police report said. “Jonathan stated that he has attempted suicide in the past and that if he ever did commit suicide, it would be a ‘spur of the moment’ event,” the report added. (Butch Forrest and Sanford confirmed that Jonathan had attempted suicide before.)Forrest was taken to the hospital for evaluation, and Amazon allowed him to return to work.In the last weeks of 2017, Forrest’s mental health deteriorated again. “It seemed like the spark died out in him,” Sanford said. “He didn’t do much toward the end except work. It was pretty much all he had to talk about.”On Jan. 2, 2018, Sanford received a text message from Forrest: “Just remember I love you.” Around the same time, while sitting down to brunch at a diner, Butch and Jane Forrest received a call from their son, Brian, who told them Jonathan had just posted a suicide note on Facebook. It said: “Sorry y’all. It was inevitably going to happen anyways. I just fired a pistol through the back of my head. Love you all.”Butch Forrest says his son was struggling on many levels, but he believes his work at Amazon was a major factor in his suicide. “When it came to holidays it would be five days in a row,” he said. “It killed him.”In a statement, Amazon said Forrest’s death “was a very sad situation and shocking for the team, who very much wanted to see Johnathan [sic] get better.”“It’s always sad when we lose a member of our team for any reason and our thoughts continue to go out to Johnathan’s family. We encourage anyone who is having suicidal thoughts to call the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-8255. Amazon employees should know we have resources available as well,” the company said.“I didn’t have the money to go to the doctor”Of the six current or former Amazon workers who spoke to The Daily Beast, five were put on leave from work. They said they struggled to obtain promised compensation, found counseling was insufficient or unaffordable, and in some cases they were fired.After being removed from Amazon by emergency responders—a situation some found humiliating—workers were often put on short-term medical or disability leave, entitling them to 60 percent of their pay and a return to their job after psychiatric clearance.While on leave, some workers used the company’s employee assistance program, which includes three phone conversations with a counselor, and also sought outside psychiatric help. Even with Amazon-provided health insurance, the costs were often a financial strain.“The frustrating part was I didn’t have the money to go to the doctor to get the paperwork they need,” said Crouch, the Lakeland, Florida, employee.Veasley said he attempted to keep his job after leaving the psych ward but was told he had been fired for exceeding the maximum unpaid time off. He said he used many of those hours to go to therapy or doctor’s appointments.Amazon said in a statement that it could not verify that Veasley used the time off for medical reasons. “Nicholas provided miscellaneous and inconsistent reasons for missing work and was often not able to provide the appropriate medical information needed for a fair excusal,” it said.“Our teams work diligently to be fair to all employees and time excusal is provided often for employees during times of hardship when they have demonstrated regular attendance and reliability. Because we care about Nicholas, we wanted to help him but could not.”But Veasley, who now works as a cook, is still angry about how he was treated.“Amazon—don’t get me wrong—they throw up a lot of sparkly stuff in front of your eyes. Ooh, benefits, great pay, job security, this that and other, ” he said.“But if you don’t read the fine print down at the bottom of this contract, you’re screwed.”Reporting for this story was funded in part by the Judith Watson Investigative Reporting Fund.\"']\n"," ['161' '1'\n","  '\"Foxconn worker plunges to death at China plant: reportHONG KONG (Reuters) - Another worker has committed suicide at the south China manufacturing complex of iPhone maker Foxconn International Holdings Ltd, state media reported on Friday, the latest in a string of employees who have leapt to their deaths this year.The employee “fell to death” early on Friday at one of Foxconn’s manufacturing facilities in the southern Chinese manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, Xinhua News Agency reported.“The death was confirmed by the municipal government. No further information was immediately available,” Xinhua said.A Foxconn spokesman was not available for comment when contacted by Reuters.Neither Shenzhen’s municipal government nor local police had any immediate comment or further details.Labour rights groups say there have been at least 13 suicides at Foxconn factories across China this year, not including Friday’s fatality.The incident comes months after several Foxconn workers, mostly in Shenzhen, died after jumping from buildings in the company’s plants earlier this year.Many of those were young migrant workers, among the millions who leave the poor hinterlands of China for the booming factory towns of coastal areas in search of work and higher wages.The deaths threw an awkward spotlight on the labor practices of Foxconn, a unit of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, whose clients include Apple Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and Sony Ericsson.Since then, the company has pledged to improve work conditions, increase pay, reduce overtime hours and build a string of giant new manufacturing complexes in inland provinces such as Henan to allow workers to live closer to home, and tap cheaper labor costs.Reporting by James Pomfret, Huang Yan and Kelvin Soh.

In a 10-year period, beginning in 1981, roughly 19,000 animals—from mice and rats to pigs—were killed in auto safety tests conducted by the General Motors Corporation (GM). This number was staggering to most Americans, who had no idea that live animals were used—and then disposed of—in automobile crash tests … that is, until PETA got involved.By September 1991, PETA had already begun a campaign against GM for its use of animals in crash tests. The first of dozens of planned protests against the car manufacturer took place at the auto show at the State Fair of Texas that year. Speaking to the media, we told the truth: Computer models and state-of-the-art dummies are the path to a safer future—not archaic, barbaric tests on animals.“People want a car that will accommodate a dog, not one that’s killed a dog. When consumers learn that animal cruelty is a built-in feature in GM cars, we think they’ll take their business elsewhere.” —Dan Mathews, PETA Senior Vice President of CampaignsWe called our campaign the “Heartbreak of America” (a play on GM’s slogan at the time) and kept pressure on the company for months on end. By early 1993, PETA members and conscientious consumers across the country had held protests at GM dealerships in at least 45 U.S. cities. We smashed GM cars outside auto shows in animal mascot outfits, and activists (including PETA’s founder and president, Ingrid Newkirk) were arrested when they blocked GM’s float during the annual Rose Parade in Pasadena, California, wearing colorful animal outfits—an event that landed on a Los Angeles Times list of the biggest controversies in Rose Parade history.© Patsy Lynch“In an age when computer models and state-of-the art dummies are the order of the day, they’re still killing innocent animals in the name of science. It’s like something out of the Dark Ages.”—Dan MathewsLater that year, after 18 months of hard-hitting PETA demonstrations speaking out against the use of live pigs and ferrets, GM officially confirmed that it had ended its use of animals in crash tests. Soon after, all other car manufacturers followed suit. Public pressure and superior science proved too much for these companies’ excuses, and countless animals were spared a violent, needless death.That was 1993. Now it’s 2018.\\xa0It’s time for all experiments on animals to end.It’s horrifying to look back now and imagine that animals were deliberately slammed into walls at high speeds in car-crash tests, yet without PETA’s campaign, the public may have remained in the dark for years as these twisted experiments continued.Today, we’re still attempting to shine a light into the darkest, deadliest laboratories where animals are suffering. Presently, at Texas A&M University, experimenters led by Joe Kornegay breed golden retrievers to develop canine muscular dystrophy (MD). This disease ravages their bodies, causing progressive muscle wasting and weakness. After 37 years, studies with these dogs haven’t led to a cure or even a treatment to reverse disease symptoms, yet they continue—despite growing pressure from PETA and other groups to move to modern, animal-free research methods.We can win this battle, too, with your help. Join us in urging Texas A&M to stop conducting MD experiments on dogs, stop breeding dogs, release those presently held for adoption into good homes, and, in the future, support only promising, modern, non-animal therapies.\"']]\n","Converting to features started.
