Baby Milk Action pdf
New York City's campaign against infant formula inspired us to look into the dubious history of this product.
Outrage started in the 1970s, when Nestle was accused of getting third world mothers hooked on formula, which is less healthy and more expensive than breast milk.
The allegations led to hearings in the Senate and the World Health Organization, resulting in a new set of marketing rules.
Yet infant formula remains a $11.5-billion-and-growing market.
'The Baby Killer' blew the lid off the formula industry in 1974.
Social rights groups began dragging the industry's exploitative practices into the spotlight in the early 1970s.
The New Internationalist published an exposé on Nestlé's marketing practices in 1973, ""Babies Mean Business,"" which described how the company got Third World mothers hooked on baby formula.
But it was ""The Baby Killer,"" a booklet published by London's War On Want organization in 1974, that really blew the lid off the baby formula industry.

""At the same time, the benefits of breastfeeding were being brought to light,"" Paige Harrigan a senior nutrition advisor with Save the Children, told Business Insider.
Vitamin A prevents blindness and lowers a child's risk of death from common diseases, while zinc might stave off diarrhea, according to the organization's State of the World Report. Six months of exclusive breastfeeding are said to increase a child's chance of survival by six times.
Still, third world women yearned for Westernization.

Poor women longed to move from a rural to an urban way of life, which prodded them to abandon breastfeeding and in turn primed them for marketing, said War on Want:
""As the social position of women changes and they go out to earn a wage ... looking at the breast as a cosmetic sex symbol rather than a source of nourishment reinforces the trend.""
War on Want said this undermined women's confidence in breastfeeding.
Playing into undernourished women's fear of harming their newborn was a ""confidence trick,"" said War on Want. When these women felt fear, pain or sadness, their milk would dry up as a result.
The ""letdown reflex, which controls the flow of milk to the mother's nipple is a nervous mechanism,"" the paper said. ""Somehow mothers are deciding that a bottle is necessary to the milk she provides ... some mothers may even become so concerned about not having enough milk that they will not have enough.""
Hospitals were also accused of pushing mothers to use formula.
This worked on two levels, said New Internationalist: In exchange for handing out ""discharge packs"" of formula, hospitals received freebies like formula and baby bottles.
""The most insidious of these is a free architectural service to hospitals which are building or renovating facilities for newborn care,"" the authors wrote.
Beyond that, the authors said ""baby milk companies spend untold millions of dollars subsidizing office furnishings, research projects, gifts, conferences, publications and travel junkets of the medical profession.""
Meanwhile in the Third World, women tried to save money by diluting the formula.
Formulas had to be mixed with water, but Third World mothers didn't understand that overdilluting it—especially with contaminated water—could ""prevent a child from absorbing the nutrients in food and lead to malnutrition,"" said War on Want.
A New York Times' article on the scandal said one Jamaican family's income ""averaged only $7 a week,"" leading the mother to dilute the water with as much as three times the recommended amount of water so she could feed two children.
Millions of babies died from malnutrition.
""The results can be seen in the clinics and hospitals, the slums and graveyards of the Third World,"" said War on Want. ""Children whose bodies have wasted away until all that is left is a big head on top of the shriveled body of an old man.""
In the Times, United States Agency for International Development official, Dr. Stephen Joseph, blamed reliance on baby formula for a million infant deaths every year through malnutrition and diarrheal diseases.
It also hindered infant growth in general, said War on Want. Citing ""complex links emerging between breast feeding and emotional and physical development,"" the group said breastfed children walked ""significantly better than bottle-fed"" kids, and were more emotionally advanced.

Published May 23, 2018 by . Last Updated May 25, 2018. In a 10-year period, beginning in 1981, roughly 19,000 animals—from mice and rats to pigs—were killed in auto safety tests conducted by the General Motors Corporation (GM). This number was staggering to most Americans, who had no idea that live animals were used—and then disposed of—in automobile crash tests … that is, until PETA got involved.By September 1991, PETA had already begun a campaign against GM for its use of animals in crash tests. The first of dozens of planned protests against the car manufacturer took place at the auto show at the State Fair of Texas that year. Speaking to the media, we told the truth: Computer models and state-of-the-art dummies are the path to a safer future—not archaic, barbaric tests on animals.“People want a car that will accommodate a dog, not one that’s killed a dog. When consumers learn that animal cruelty is a built-in feature in GM cars, we think they’ll take their business elsewhere.” —Dan Mathews, PETA Senior Vice President of CampaignsWe called our campaign the “Heartbreak of America” (a play on GM’s slogan at the time) and kept pressure on the company for months on end. By early 1993, PETA members and conscientious consumers across the country had held protests at GM dealerships in at least 45 U.S. cities. We smashed GM cars outside auto shows in animal mascot outfits, and activists (including PETA’s founder and president, Ingrid Newkirk) were arrested when they blocked GM’s float during the annual Rose Parade in Pasadena, California, wearing colorful animal outfits—an event that landed on a Los Angeles Times list of the biggest controversies in Rose Parade history.© Patsy Lynch“In an age when computer models and state-of-the art dummies are the order of the day, they’re still killing innocent animals in the name of science. It’s like something out of the Dark Ages.”—Dan MathewsLater that year, after 18 months of hard-hitting PETA demonstrations speaking out against the use of live pigs and ferrets, GM officially confirmed that it had ended its use of animals in crash tests. Soon after, all other car manufacturers followed suit. Public pressure and superior science proved too much for these companies’ excuses, and countless animals were spared a violent, needless death.That was 1993. Now it’s 2018. It’s time for all experiments on animals to end.It’s horrifying to look back now and imagine that animals were deliberately slammed into walls at high speeds in car-crash tests, yet without PETA’s campaign, the public may have remained in the dark for years as these twisted experiments continued.Today, we’re still attempting to shine a light into the darkest, deadliest laboratories where animals are suffering. Presently, at Texas A&M University, experimenters led by Joe Kornegay breed golden retrievers to develop canine muscular dystrophy (MD). This disease ravages their bodies, causing progressive muscle wasting and weakness. After 37 years, studies with these dogs haven’t led to a cure or even a treatment to reverse disease symptoms, yet they continue—despite growing pressure from PETA and other groups to move to modern, animal-free research methods.We can win this battle, too, with your help. Join us in urging Texas A&M to stop conducting MD experiments on dogs, stop breeding dogs, release those presently held for adoption into good homes, and, in the future, support only promising, modern, non-animal therapies."ÿÿLooking Back: 25 Years Ago, PETA Ended Car-Crash Tests on Animals

An outcry has erupted in recent days over former Colombian hostage (and former presidential candidate) Ingrid Betancourt. Almost eight years ago, Betancourt defiantly drove through dangerous territory in Southern Colombia, apparently against the advice of security forces, to meet with FARC rebel forces and try to break an impasse in peace negotiations. Instead, she was herself taken hostage and held for over six years. She was rescued in a daring raid by government troops that made headlines around the world. Last week, however, she started legal proceedings against the Colombian government claiming US$6 million in damages. A new word was coined describing the public outcry at her actions: “Ingrititude.” She was forced to withdraw the claim and to announce that she only holds the FARC forces responsible for her capture and suffering and, inexplicably, does not intend to claim damages for herself.
Is there really no one else responsible beside the FARC? Who provided the FARC terrorists with material assistance? These questions are being addressed as former hostages (and survivors of other victims) have sued for damages in some cases – not against the Colombian government but against private companies like Coca-Cola, Drummond Coal, and Chiquita Brands. As I reviewed in Part Two of this series, however, the cases against Coca-Cola and Drummond Coal were dismissed. A recent court decision, however, sustained – as a provisional matter and subject to evidence — lawsuits which allege that Chiquita provided extensive material support – not just extorted monies but covert arms transport – in a campaign designed to destroy banana unions and keep Chiquita in business in Colombia.
A review of the various allegations is very timely this week as the world considers: who is responsible in damages for murders and kidnappings carried out by the guerillas and paramilitaries in Colombia before they were beaten back by government forces?
1.
In the 1990’s and into this decade, Chiquita Brands’ Colombian subsidiary, Banadex, operated over 200 farms and controlled significant amounts of land area in two very challenging parts of Colombia: the Urabá region adjacent to the Panama border, and the Santa Marta region in Northeast Colombia adjacent to Venezuela. Both were dominated by warring factions. Initially, it was the communist guerillas of the FARC and ELN, but they were displaced by the paramilitary forces of the AUC. The paramilitaries, over time, operated very closely with government forces and the military, and there were in fact decrees and other laws specifically coordinating government action with the paramilitaries during the very late 90’s and into the early 2000’s. Like the guerillas before them, the paramilitaries exacted security payments from landowners like Chiquita – i.e., extortion.
But how far did Chiquita go in making these payments and cooperating with the guerillas and then the paramilitaries? New cases allege that the Chiquita payments were made to de facto governments in those areas, and therefore were not just actions complicit in numerous deaths, but corrupt payments to foreign government officials. These allegations, still untested, follow a court ruling earlier this year finding a complaint against Chiquita legally sufficient on its face – though still unproven – to state valid claims of violations of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
What did Chiquita do?
The answer depends upon whom you ask. In this article I present information from Chiquita’s own special investigation and from the unproven allegations of families of several murder victims as evaluated by a federal judge for legal sufficiency in a recent decision. A third source of information was covered in Part One — Chiquita’ guilty plea to a single transaction with a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Organization.
2.
In this section, I review the findings made by a special investigation launched after Chiquita Brands, the US-based parent company, was hit with shareholder lawsuits alleging that senior officials of the company breached fiduciary duty wasted corporate assets in connection with illegal conduct in its Colombia operations. Independent members of Chiquita’s board of directors constituted a special litigation committee (the “Special Committee”) to investigate the facts, and hired a large New York international law firm. The committee issued a 269-page report (the “Special Report”) detailing that Chiquita paid monies under extortion threats, out of concern for the safety of its workers, and recommended that the company seek to dismiss the lawsuit against it by the shareholders. The Special Committee concluded that the officers and directors of Chiquita made fair business judgments and were not liable to the shareholders. In January, Chiquita settled shareholder derivative actions relating to payments by adopting corporate governance and compliance changes and paying attorneys fees.
The Special Committee’s report provides extensive detailed findings that Banadex made payments, first to the FARC and ELN guerillas, and then to the paramilitaries. The payments were arranged in person in some cases, and were actively concealed throughout. Colombian lawyers opined that extortion payments were not illegal payments.
Many would view the Special Committee as biased in favor of Chiquita, and, the burden for shareholder liability is very different from the burden for tort liability. Indeed, the Special Report lists several determinative factors for its decision to seek dismissal of the claims against Chiquita, including the expense to the company of continued litigation, reputational harm, and diversion of management time and resources. Also included was the Special Committee’s finding that none of the company directors and officers involved acted in any bad faith.
Nevertheless, the Special Committee investigation was quite thorough, and included seeking the information of the plaintiffs’ counsel. The Special Report, in a footnote, discounted that Chiquita had any role in any arms shipments, saying:
The Special Committee found evidence of only three specific incidents of smuggling, all of them by third parties. The Special Committee found no evidence that any Chiquita employees committee wrongdoing in connection with these incidents or that any member of senior Banadex of Chiquita management had prior knowledge of or involvement in them. The evidence shows that, in each instance, the event was reported internally, appropriately investigated, and any necessary remedial steps were taken. Despite requests made by the Special Committee to all lead counsel in the [Anti-Terrorism Act/Alien Tort Statute] cases for any evidence supporting claims that Chiquita was involved in drugs and arms smuggling, no such evidence was provided.
The report also indicated that the Special Committee had the full cooperation of the Company and its personnel (none of whom were charged by the Department of Justice with any crimes), which the DOJ obviously did not have, and had full access to the company’s investigation relating to the DOJ charges, and reviewed reams and reams of documents.
Special Committee counsel met periodically during its investigation with lead plaintiffs’ counsel to brief them on the facts adduced and the procedures being followed, and received no objection. Special Committee counsel were informed by lead plaintiff’s counsel that their allegations were based upon publicly available information – they otherwise had no documentation of any of their claims. This looms as a major factor.
Significantly, there was no evidence found of any actual nexus between Chiquita payments or activities and specific acts of murder or kidnapping. And, the report cites Colombian lawyers’ opinions that extortion payments are not illegal payments, and that payments to a duly-authorized and -constituted “convivir” organization were not illegal. The report finds instead that all individuals, even those who made recognized errors, acted in good faith out of concern for harm to Banadex personnel under extortion. This perspective gave no express consideration to the possibility, central to the argument seen later in the New Times Missionaries case, that Banadex directly benefited by AUC payments that harassed and limited the banana worker unions. There is also no apparent consideration of why Chiquita did not earlier report the extortion payments to the authorities and seek legal protection, whether in the United States or Colombia. On the contrary, as recognized in the New Times Missionaries case, a Chiquita executive stated that, but for Chiquita’s informing the U.S. Department of Justice in 2003, the facts would likely never have come to light.
According to the Special Committee report, Chiquita made payments to both the communist FARC/ELN and the right-wing paramilitaries, at different times falling into three periods from 1989 through 2004. During the first time period, from 1989 though at least 1997, Chiquita made payments to the FARC and the ELN (Ejercito de Liberación Nacional, or National Liberation Army). The FARC was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States in 1997, and was long known before that to be a violent terrorist organization.
In the second phase, from roughly 1997 to September 10, 2001, Chiquita shifted its payments to the AUC or Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, also known as the paramilitaries. Paramilitary forces first emerged as Antioquia landowners fought the guerilla insurgencies seeking the violent overthrow of the Colombian government, particularly where the national army and police were feckless. Over time they consolidated into the AUC, and their conduct resulted, on the day before 9/11, in the U.S. Government naming the AUC a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially-Designated Global Terrorist. Payments were also made during this phase to an organization called “convivir” (meaning “live together”) closely associated with the paramilitaries.
In the third and most difficult phase, Banadex’s paramilitary payments continued after and despite the September 10, 2001 determination by the United States Government that the AUC was a “Foreign Terrorist Organization.” This determination meant that any payments to the AUC were strictly prohibited. Chiquita executives failed to discover this terrorist designation for over eighteen months, having missed news reports to that effect and despite the events of 9/11 that clearly raised the level of international concern about terrorist organizations. Chiquita nevertheless continued to make the prohibited payments — out of concern for its workers’ safety, the Special Report found – until late 2004. No payments have been made since, and the subsidiary was later sold off.
Chiquita reportedly had a “robust” (according to the Special Committee) FCPA compliance program. It stemmed from the fact that Chiquita’s predecessor, United Fruit, engaged in conduct in Hondura that was a principal reason for passage of the FCPA and resulted in a consent decree requiring the company to institute rigorous compliance procedures relating to payments to or for the benefit of foreign officials. The program reportedly captured information about most of the improper payments, and Chiquita obtained and relied upon Colombian legal opinions that determined (without question) that the payments were extorted, that is, obtained by force and under duress, and therefore not illegal under Colombian law.
Nevertheless, Chiquita failed to learn about and report to the correct authorities in upper management all of the payments. Moreover, certain aspects of the payments were not reflected properly in company books and records. For example, the paramilitaries summoned a Chiquita official to a meeting at which threats were made if the payments were not forthcoming. this meeting was not documented or reported in the company. Also, the Special Committee was (justifiably) critical of the audit committee and general counsel’s failure to learn timely about the foreign terrorist organization designation and to make sure that Banadex did not violate the law against payments to a foreign terrorist organization. (However critical, the Special Committee’s response seems more muted that it would have been if the violations of the Anti-Terrorist Act concerned an organization like Al Qaeda instead of the FARC or AUC, but that is pure speculation.)
Chiquita has had other problems in Colombia. In 2001, Chiquita was charged with paying bribes to a port officials through a customs broker to renew rights to use port facilities. Chiquita admitted the payments, which also weren’t caught in its books and records, and which were made without the knowledge or consent of any employee at the parent level and in apparent contravention of Chiquita’s policies. The initial payment was recorded as a maritime donation on the Company’s books and the second installment was identified as relating to a maritime agreement. Chiquita’s internal audit subsequently discovered the payments, and the relevant employees were terminated. Chiquita paid a $100,000 fine and agreed to a cease-and-desist order. (SEC v. Chiquita Brands Int’l, Inc., Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Rel. No. 1,464 (Oct. 3, 2001). Read more about this case from Transparency.org and from Goliath.) It stands generally for the proposition that where the DOJ brings criminal charges against a foreign, wholly-owned subsidiary, the Issuer parent is typically held civilly accountable for the failure of the subsidiary to maintain accurate books and records and for its own lack of internal controls that should have prevented and caught the FCPA violations, even if the Issuer had no knowledge of the conduct.
The Special Committee does concede a number of errors by its directors. Its general counsel failed to notice for over eighteen months that the party it was paying extortion had been added to a federal list of persons with whom it is a crime to engage in transactions because they are terrorists. This occurred a day before the events of 9/11. Similarly, he delayed in telling the audit committee for five weeks, waiting for a regularly scheduled meeting, about the terrorist designation. The general counsel failed to stop two payments to the “convivir” because he forgot about them. And he did not tell the audit committee the payments were going to continue despite the terrorist designation because the Special Committee believed, after dozens of hours of interviews, he was truly concerned that failure to pay would result in injury, kidnapping, or death. The Special Committee had similar concerns about the conduct of an independent director (and former SEC Chairman) who took over management of the issue after the terrorist designation was discovered. But the Special Committee’s concerns did not include any of the decisions to make the payments themselves.
3.
The complaint filed by survivors of several members of the New Tribes Missionaries who were kidnapped and murdered makes allegations that are unproven — that makes them unreliable. In fact, the Special Report states that the plaintiffs’ attorneys were asked to provide information relating (among other things) to alleged drug and weapons smuggling, and none was forthcoming. To put it mildly, the case has not been tested. No witnesses have sworn their testimony under oath, no one has been cross-examined, and hearsay and other non-evidence has not been ferreted out. The Special Committee reported, moreover, that the plaintiffs counsel they consulted had no evidence that was not publicly-available.
However, with detailed factual allegations and a court’s determination that, if true, the allegations are sufficient to require Chiquita to pay damages, the New Tribes Missionaries case is important to study. It deals only with FARC payments (not the later AUC payments), and is similar to the claims made by former hostage Stansell and his Northrup Grumman co-workers and their families. Chiquita is facing similar lawsuits from over 200 plaintiffs injured by terrorist acts caused by the right-wing paramilitaries.
Under the Anti-Terrorism Act, a federal district court judge granted an order finding that, if the as-yet-unproven allegations are true, they would suffice to make Chiquita liable for the FARC’s murders of the missionaries. The same judge is hearing all the consolidated cases involving Chiquita.
The survivors of the five New Times Missionaries allege that the five were killed (in separate incidents in 1993 and 1994 through acts of international terrorism by the FARC, and that Chiquita aided and abetted the FARC, conspired with the FARC, and provided material support to the FARC.
Chiquita is a multinational corporation incorporated in New Jersey and headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. One of the largest banana companies on the planet, it operated through its wholly-owned subsidiary, C.I. Bananos de Exportacion, S.A. (“Banadex”) until approximately May 2004. Banadex had over 2000 farms. The complaint alleges that Banadex was Chiquita’s controlled subsidiary, agent, and/or alter ego.
Chiquita’s payments to FARC, which began as cash at FARC’s request, escalated into regular monthly payments ranging from $20,000.00 to $100,000.00. Over time, the payments were fixed to a percentage of Banadex’s gross revenues, with as much as ten percent being diverted to FARC.”
Chiquita went to great lengths to mask payments to the FARC (made from 1989-1997), by delivering them first in cash by a senior employee who is a former American military pilot, then later by padding the payroll with fake names through front organizations, and also by working with labor unions controlled or co-opted by the FARC, including the Sintrabanano banana workers union. Chiquita also conspired in setting up false “front” entities and fictitious contracts to confuse authorities. The allegations include that Chiquita worked with the FARC and its controlled unions for commercial advantage, such as by subverting some unions and having Chiquita’s competition intimidated.
The complaint also charges that Chiquita provided the FARC with weapons, ammunition and other supplies through its transportation contractors. Chiquita transport systems were used to funnel weapons and ammunition.
Chiquita did so knowing, or consciously avoiding, the fact that FARC was a violent terrorist organization.
As part of its guilty plea in response to charges of unlawfully collaborating with the paramilitaries, Chiquita also admitted to a history of payments to the FARC. “Chiquita admitted to using many tactics similar to those alleged above as a means of disguising and hiding its AUC payments.”
On the assumption that these facts were true and under a permissive standard that only requires the allegations to rise above “the speculative level,” the Court made these legal rulings:
* Allegations that Chiquita systematically concealed its conduct, if true, would suffice to bar the application of the four-year statute of limitation as a matter of equity., * Financial support of the FARC constitutes an act of “international terrorism,” as liability is not limited to those who actual kill or kidnap but extends to those who aid and abet the terrorists. Allegations of conspiracy were also upheld, the Court ruled, rejecting a comparison to the Coca-Cola/FARC case (In re Sinaltrainal Litigation, 578 F.3d 1252 (11th Cir. 2009), where the “attenuated” conspiracy allegations were insufficient to “nudge their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.” Conspiracy was sufficiently pleaded on the allegations that Chiquita, knowing the FARC was a terrorist organization, intentionally agreed to provide the FARC with money, weapons, and services, and to conceal its actions, in order to subvert local unions and protect its banana business. Many critics and commentators suggest that the District Judge’s ruling will not stand up in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals precisely because of the similarity to the allegations of the Coca-Cola/FARC relationship, but others say that the drafters of the Complaint against Chiquita (and the District Judge) learned from the Coca-Cola case to paint(or, in the Judge’s case, evaluate) a picture of much more direct and knowing support in the Chiquita case. They were also benefited, undoubtedly, by the Chiquita guilty plea recited in the Complaint., * Allegations were sufficiently pleaded that Chiquita provided “material support” to terrorists, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2339a(b), by providing money, weapons, and false documentation., * Allegations were sufficiently pleaded that Chiquita’s FARC support proximately caused the deaths of the Missionaries, under a standard that only requires that the provision of support occurred before the killings and was a “substantial factor” resulting in the killings. This test would be satisfied if a reasonably prudent person could foresee that a harm like the killings might result from his actions. The Court rejected Chiquita’s argument that plaintiffs should have to show that the killings would not have occurred ‘but for” Chiquita’s support of the FARC. And the court did not require any more specific nexus between the payments and the acts resulting in the Missionaries’ deaths.,

The problem
In November 2006, regulatory investigations of the German engineering giant Siemens revealed that hundreds of employees had been siphoning off millions of Euros into ""phoney consultants' contracts, false bills and shell firms"" to pay massive bribes to win contracts. A trial judge described it as ""a system of organised irresponsibility that was implicitly condoned"" (senior managers used removable sticky notes to authorise potentially incriminating documents).
The scandal shamed Siemens, not only in the eyes of furious shareholders and investors but also the German public, and brought humiliation to its employees. Its trustworthiness came under intense scrutiny, its integrity was called into question, as well as the benevolence of its senior leaders in appearing to tolerate such practices. One leading group of shareholders questioned the Board's basic competence for its handling of the affair.
Yet Siemens' full response to the scandal has been widely praised by many independent anti-corruption and ethics experts, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and US Federal authorities.
The initial response
At first, Siemens played down the affair as a matter of a few million Euros. Within a month, its own estimate of the sums involved had spiralled to €420m (£350m). Key executives repeatedly denied awareness or involvement.
This initial tactic appeared self-serving and did little to protect, let alone enhance, stakeholders' impressions of its integrity. Many viewed it as incompetent.
The diagnosis
As well as four international investigations, Siemens announced its own rigorous internal inquiry by New York law firm Debevoise & Plimpton.
Even so, it was not until the following year that the most serious revelations came to light. This followed the departures of the then-CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and chairman Heinrich von Pierer, and the decision by Kleinfeld's successor, Peter Löscher, to announce a month-long amnesty for employees to come forward, explicitly excluding former directors. Around 40 whistleblowers gave incriminating evidence, which extended the scandal's reach into the previous board.
Several systemic elements have been cited as contributing to the scandal, including: an aggressive growth strategy that, arguably, compelled managers to see bribes as a tempting short-cut to hitting tough performance targets. a complex, matrix-like structure that allowed divisions to effectively run themselves, and poor accounting processes.
Perhaps above all, Siemens' then-corporate culture seemed openly tolerant of bribes, helping staff to feel they were ""not only acceptable but implicitly encouraged"". (However, it should be noted that bribes were common practice in German business at the time, and even tax-deductible.)
The intervention
Early on, Siemens appointed Michael Hershman, co-founder of Transparency International, to serve as its adviser – a shrewd move to affiliate itself with a leading anti-corruption expert.
Siemens rolled out strict new rules and anti-corruption/compliance processes. It hired over 500 full-time compliance officers (up from just 86 in 2006), and a former Interpol official to head its new investigation unit. It also established compliance hotlines, and an external ombudsman based worldwide and online. It created a web portal for employees to evaluate risk in their client and supplier interactions.
In an attempt to change its internal culture, Siemens launched a comprehensive training and education programme on anti-corruption practises for its employees. By 2008, Siemens had trained more than half its 400,000-strong global workforce on anti-corruption issues.
Siemens announced it would avoid competing in certain known hotspots for corruption or unethical practice, such as Sudan – a simple gesture, although not materially punishing to the company's finances.
More substantial was the decision to voluntarily suspend its applications for funding from the World Bank for two years. It also agreed to a 15-year programme to pay $100m to non-profit organisations fighting corruption. Finally, the firm took over 900 internal disciplinary actions, including dismissals.
As well as the staff amnesty, Löscher replaced Siemens' dauntingly complex matrix structure with a more streamlined one comprising just three divisions, whose MDs sit on the board. Millions of bank account statements, documents and transactions were reviewed.
Overall, the scandal cost Siemens €2.5bn, including €2bn of fines. The firm was also barred from dealings with certain clients. The cost to employees of two years of shame under intense public scrutiny, especially in Germany, is difficult to calculate.
Löscher – still Siemens' CEO – has been commended for his approach to ending corruption, but he has argued that changing the corporate culture to one driven by ethical standards ""is a marathon for us, not a sprint"". By June 2008, however, some executives were sufficiently confident to declare Siemens ""the most squeaky clean company"".
The lessons learned
• Unethical behaviour can be very costly.
• Premature dismissals of developing scandals can appear self-serving and incompetent, and compound the original problem. The trustworthy course of action is to acknowledge the accusations and to share any known facts, and to initiate a full, urgent and independent enquiry.
• Independent, ideally external, investigations are the most credible indicator of trustworthiness. The painful rigour of such an investigation can be resented, but it must be endured, until the full extent of the failure is laid bare.
• Discovering the true scale and depth of a trust failure may only be possible when senior leaders leave, and an amnesty is offered to staff to encourage them to come forward.
• The timescale for a major ethics overhaul is long - measured in years, not months - as it invariably involves cultural change. Has Siemens declared victory prematurely?
• Structural, procedural and cultural interventions should be adopted concurrently. For example, strengthening compliance monitoring and codes of conduct must be backed up with senior leaders' exhortations and training investment.
• Voluntary penance is often necessary for effectively restoring trust. It helps to demonstrate that the organisation has learned from the experience, and the willing submission to punishment implies remorse and concern for damaged relationships.

» 305 - COSTA RICA - CHIQUITA : INDIGESTIBLE BANANAS
From 7 May to 30 June 2007
With 115 plantations and sales in over 60 countries, Chiquita is world leader in the banana market, ex aequo with its main rival Dole. Under mounting pressure from consumers, Chiquita now boasts of production that meets social and environmental criteria. ""A ""clean"" banana, grown with no pesticides, cared for and picked by workers whose rights are fully respected"", this is what Chiquita promises us for the future. [1] On its website the multinational claims that its plantations are run on a socially responsible basis, with respect for both its workers and the environment. [2] Since 2005 Chiquita bananas have been certified by the Rainforest Alliance environmental standard. The company furthermore boasts the SA8000 social standard which requires compliance with basic ILO labour standards [3]. Yet on the Coyol plantation [4] in Costa Rica, the Compañia Bananera Atlántica Limitada (COBAL), a Chiquita subsidiary, violates its workers’ basic rights and endangers their health, in full impunity.
At 5 a.m. on 16 March 2007, Alexander Reyes Zuñiga, Marco Gonzáles Borges and Jaime Blanco Juárez started their day’s work on the Coyal banana plantation, owned by the company COBAL, a Chiquita subsidiary. They had been cutting and gathering fruit for about an hour, in the section of the plantation to which they had been assigned by their supervisor, when they noticed that another team in the same section was busy spraying the fruit manually with a nematicide. This pesticide, used against certain parasites which cause the most damage on banana plantations, is one of the most toxic for humans. Having received strict instructions as to the number of bunches of bananas that had to be harvested, the three men decided to carry on working. A few minutes later Alexander Zuñiga and Jaime Juáres suddenly became nauseous and dizzy. J. Juáres was taken to a clinic where he remained under observation for several hours, on a drip. His colleague reported the incident to his superiors who told him to take milk with sweetened water and sent him home without any further care. The next day Alexander Zuñiga told his supervisor that he was still suffering from the same symptoms of poisoning. However, since the supervisor did ""not have enough workers"" available, he ordered him to resume his work. Angry about not having been informed of the fumigation that was supposed to take place in the same area in which they were working, and of thus being exposed to nematocide poisoning, two of the workers concerned reported the incident and accused their supervisors of being responsible. Not only was their complaint not taken into consideration, the two men were summoned by the company management for a disciplinary procedure that ended in their dismissal for misconduct! They were accused of entering the area that was to be fumigated, despite specific orders prohibiting them from doing so.
Serious irregularities in the procedure
Despite overwhelming evidence, and without even bothering to conduct a medical examination on the workers concerned, Chiquita denied everything: the poisoning of the COBAL workers and the irregularity of the procedure. Yet the two workers accused of misconduct had no opportunity to defend themselves and were not even informed of the content of the testimonies that supposedly justified their dismissal. Moreover, whereas the procedure specified by Costa Rican labour regulations provides for three warnings before dismissal for disciplinary reasons, Alexander Zuñiga and Marco Borges were sacked without any warning.
Intimidation of workers
The firm’s attitude has been condemned by the SITAGAH, the industrial union of agricultural workers of Heredia [5] and by COSIBA-CR, the committee of banana trade unions [6]. These two union organizations accuse the firm of using intimidation to dissuade workers from denouncing the fact that their rights were flouted. More generally, the unions condemn the abusive behaviour of COBAL which uses private militia to intimidate workers by searching their homes without official authorization and threatening to report Nicaraguan migrant workers to the immigration services. The firm even grants itself the right to confiscate their official documents. Workers and unions also accuse the banana firm of careless use of pesticides on its plantations, where workers’ health is regularly endangered. In addition to fumigation of the soil with pesticides, spraying the fruit with toxic substances has been denounced for years by the unions. Many complaints have already been made in this respect but the firm consistently ignores them. Although there is a regional agreement between the unions and Chiquita [7], in terms of which the firm has to respond to complaints within three days, it has still not responded to some complaints filed over a year ago.
FURTHER INFORMATION
Peuples Solidaires mission to the plantations in 2005 A Peuples Solidaires delegation visited Costa Rica in December 2005. This was an opportunity to meet representatives of the banana union Sitagah. Delegation members visited plantations and witnessed the difficulties facing trade unions. Lasting partnerships were formed.

Greenpeace links food manufacturer with mass deforestation
Photograph: Frank Baron
Nestlé is fighting a PR battle with Greenpeace over claims that it is continuing to source palm oil from Sinar Mas, the Indonesian company accused of illegal deforestation and peatland clearance.
Greenpeace alleges that plantation expansion by Sinar Mas is endangering orang-utans by encroaching on their habitat. Its latest campaign features a video of an office worker inadvertently biting into an orang-utan finger instead of a Kit Kat chocolate bar.
Ian Duff, a campaigner for the environmental NGO, said: ""this is something we've brought up with Nestlé time and time again and they've failed to act.""
In late 2009, Greenpeace released a report alleging that Sinar Mas was clearing rainforest and peatland without permits from the government. Unilever and Kraft both suspended contracts with Sinar Mas subsidiaries as a result. At the time, Nestlé said it would make its own investigations into the matter.
Nestlé was quick to respond to the latest campaign, saying it had found a new supplier. However, it admitted that it still sources palm oil from Sinar Mas through its supplier Cargill and that a full review of its supply chain would take until the end of April 2010.
Nestlé has committed to using only ""certified sustainable palm oil"" by 2015. Like fellow food manufacturers Unilever and Kraft, it is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a consortium of buyers and producers promoting sustainably produced palm oil.
RSPO membership entails certain obligations but most are directed at producers, and buyers claim the current supply of sustainable palm oil is not sufficient. Critics of the organisation say its demands are too vague and it lacks teeth. Ian Duff says the conditions of membership are ""not strong enough and not policed"".
""Unilever has gone beyond its commitments to the RSPO by cancelling contracts. That's what other companies need to do.""
Palm oil is widely used in the production of food and cosmetics. Demand has expanded considerably in the last two decades and Greenpeace expects it to double by 2030. If the biofuel industry takes off, this could drive demand even higher.
Over the past 60 years Indonesia has lost an area of rainforest three times the size of the UK. The United Nations Environment Programme says palm oil production is the main cause of deforestation, which is occurring at a rate of about 2% per year. Indonesia is also the world's third largest carbon emitter, largely as a result of deforestation and the burning of peatlands."ÿÿNestlé stars in smear campaign over Indonesian palm oil

 Published October 15, 2019 by .  After PETA pointed out that cows used for leather are castrated and branded, their tails are cut off, and they often face even worse abuse before their throats are slit in slaughterhouses, Redfora—the emergency-preparedness company behind The Earthquake Bag—has agreed to replace all leather gloves in its kits with eco-friendly vegan versions.Are you #prepared for the next #earthquake?! Get ready with the help of @Earthquakebag #redfora #readyforanything #earthquakebag #earthquakekit #emergencypreparedness https://t.co/LBuLZFIBWz— Redfora (@WeAreRedfora) August 17, 2019Redfora’s decision will help curb both environmental destruction and cruelty to gentle cows.A PETA video exposé of Brazil’s JBS S.A.—the world’s largest leather processor—revealed that cows and bulls were branded on the face, electroshocked, and beaten before being killed for meat and leather. After a lifetime of suffering, cows are typically transported to slaughterhouses, where their throats are slit and some are even skinned and dismembered while they’re still conscious.Animal agriculture—which includes the leather industry—is responsible for nearly a fifth of human-induced greenhouse-gas emissions and is devastating the planet on a global scale. More than 80% of the Amazon rainforest that’s been cleared since 1970 is used for grazing or for growing food for cattle who are ultimately slaughtered for food and whose skin is usually turned into leather. Recent reports found that in three environmental-impact categories—water scarcity, climate change, and overall environmental well-being—cow leather has almost three times the negative environmental impact of polyurethane leather. Vegan leather can also be made from recycled plastics, pineapples, fruit pulp, and other materials.©Redfora PETA applauds Redfora for making this important change and urges other retailers as well as the public to follow this company’s lead and ditch leather in favor of durable vegan clothing and accessories.What You Can DoWhether there’s an earthquake, a hurricane, or any other disaster, never leave your animals behind.

After hearing from PETA, PETA Switzerland, and PETA Germany, pharmaceutical giant Roche Pharmaceuticals has just said that it’s ending its use of the near-drowning test on mice and other small animals. Roche joins fellow top 10 pharma companies Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie as well as others in banning the abusive forced swim test.© iStock.com/DenBomaBetween 2001 and 2018, Roche published at least 11 papers that describe its use of the forced swim test in experiments involving more than 800 mice and rats. Experimenters in laboratories where these tests are conducted drop small animals into inescapable containers of water and watch as they frantically look for an escape. Animals try to climb out, dive underwater searching for an exit, and struggle to stay afloat. The experiments are purportedly to study depression in humans, but experts in the field have repeatedly called the test’s validity into question or outright refuted any conclusions drawn from watching animals attempt to keep from drowning.PETA neuroscientist Dr. Emily Trunnell just had one such critique published in the peer-reviewed journal Brain Stimulation. In response to a paper published by experimenters who subjected rats to the forced swim test in order to make claims about ways to help humans with depression, she pointed out, “The authors offered no discussion as to other possible interpretations of the animals’ behavior or to the scientific controversy surrounding this behavioral test.”Published by The Dominion PostNew Zealand cartoonist Sharon Murdoch reveals the absurdity of the forced swim test.Dr. Trunnell went on to describe how the use of animals in nonsense experiments like the forced swim test is a major factor in the lack of progress in developing new and effective therapies for humans. She urged scientists to abandon these antiquated practices and focus on human-relevant research methods, such as the use of patient cells to develop personalized medicine and computer modeling based on the human body and mind.PETA is working to end all near-drowning tests on animals.

And with PETA’s efforts, fewer and fewer of them are. Japan’s largest flavor and aroma company, Takasago International Corporation, is banning all animal tests used to establish health claims for marketing ingredients following discussions with PETA. Takasago is the seventh-largest flavor and aroma company in the world, meaning that many of your favorite flavors are now cruelty-free.© iStock.com/Flore SakowskiThe company had recently stopped conducting animal experiments, but it had made no mention of those that it commissioned or funded in other laboratories. Working with PETA, Takasago agreed that additional measures are necessary. The company told us:“[W]e agree and it is also our understanding that our policy for animal tests must apply not only to our own researches but also researches by universities and third-party research organizations … that we fund in any way. We will shortly communicate with them to make an agreement with a clause stating the fund can only be used for non-animal testing. We will then revise the policy appropriately.”And shortly thereafter, Takasago posted its all-encompassing new policy publicly on its website. Because of this victory, mice’s skulls will no longer be removed with an electric grinder, chemicals won’t be injected into their brains, their heads won’t be cut off, and they won’t be dissected—all of which Takasago had previously supported in experiments.This is just the latest in a long series of victories for animals that PETA scientists have won after talking with food and beverage makers. Among the companies we’ve persuaded to go cruelty-free are major producers such as The Coca-Cola Company, General Mills Inc., The Hershey Company, the Kellogg Company, Kikkoman Corporation, Kirin Holdings Co., PepsiCo Inc., POM Wonderful LLC, and Unilever.

Apple is more secretive about its supply chain in China than almost all of its rivals, according to a new report by anti-pollution activists who accuse the company's products of degrading the environment and poisoning workers.
Despite its claim to be a leading promoter of corporate ethics worldwide, the maker of iPads and iPhones came joint bottom among 29 major IT firms in a transparency study drawn up by a coalition of China's leading environmental groups.
""Behind their stylish image, Apple products have a side many do not know about – pollution and poison. This side is hidden deep within the company's secretive supply chain,"" claims a statement by the 36 groups involved in the Green Choice Initiative.
Their report – the fourth to look at the impact of global brands on China's environment – considers the openness of IT firms and their responsiveness to reports of environmental violations at suppliers.
It follows a series of workplace poisonings, heavy metal contamination incidents and suicides at Chinese factories that supply materials and components for mobile phones and computers.
Many leading brands outsource production to little-known Chinese firms, where labour costs can be lower, safety standards weaker and environmental regulations more lax than in the west.
Foreign companies say they promote global levels of corporate social responsibility. Apple's supplier code of conduct claims to draw upon ""internationally recognised standards to advance social and environmental responsibility"".
But it is difficult for third parties to hold foreign firms to account because they tend to be secretive about their suppliers, citing corporate confidentiality. This lack of transparency, combined with official corruption and dire political accountability, has made China a haven for polluters.
In recent years, more than 3,000 children have been diagnosed with unsafe levels of lead in their blood in a series of heavy-metal contamination outbreaks near smelting plants. Many of the facilities provided materials used in the batteries and casings for foreign IT firms.
None of the 29 firms in the survey obliged their suppliers to disclose details of waste discharges, though there were big differences in their responses to public inquiries and reported environmental problems. Apple was ranked – alongside other major consumer electronics firms – as the least willing to provide data or to answer questions about suppliers.
The authors say Apple's suppliers have been involved in breaches of environmental regulations. The report noted waste discharge violations in recent years at several Chinese firms that are thought to be part of Apple's supply chain.
Labour conditions were also called into question when at least a dozen workers jumped to their deaths last spring at the Foxconn electronics complex in Shenzhen, which makes parts for Apple and other foreign companies.
Critics say foreign firms are largely responsible for pollution because they insist on low prices, which puts pressure on suppliers to cut costs and corners. This is disputed by the companies.
Apple's reticence was heavily criticised last May, when at least 62 workers fell sick after inhaling n-hexane used to clean touch screens at a Wintek electronics factory in Suzhou. The managers at the Taiwan-owned plant reportedly switched to the noxious chemical – which can cause nerve damage for up to two years – apparently because it dried more quickly than alcohol, thus increasing efficiency.
Hospitalised victims, cited in the new Green Choice video, said they made products for Apple and have written to the company's chief executive, Steve Jobs, requesting an explanation.
""We want to ask you whether or not you should be responsible for the supplier companies you have chosen?"" they ask in the letter. ""When you look down at the Apple phone you are using in your hand and you swipe it with your finger is it possible that you can feel as if it is no longer a beautiful screen to show off, but the life and the blood of us employees and victims? Did you supervise the auditing staff to ensure that they were responsible and diligent?""
Nokia and Motorola responded to questions about their involvement with Wintek soon after the poisoning was revealed. Apple has yet to confirm or deny a relationship. The company said it would not comment on individual allegations.
The report's authors say they tried for months to raise Wintek with Apple, but it refused to comment directly.
""This attitude means it is impossible to have any public supervision over their supply chain. Without that how can we trust them?"" said Ma Jun of the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs. ""When environmental violations become public knowledge, they should not use commercial confidentiality as an excuse for silence. This is different from other leading brands.""
Hewlett Packard, British Telecom, Samsung, Sony, Siemens and Alcatel were credited as being the most responsive to third-party inquiries about alleged environmental violations.

37ÿ2012-11-21ÿ2ÿLabels&Standardsÿ1ÿPeopleÿ2ÿpositiveÿ17ÿNestléÿ29ÿDeutsche Welle (DW)ÿhttps://www.dw.com/en/labor-group-to-inspect-nestle-suppliers-for-kids-on-cocoa-farms/a-15618110ÿ"Labor group to inspect Nestle suppliers for kids on cocoa farms | DW | 21.12.2011
An initiative from Nestle aims to make sure the company does not profit from child labor on its farms. An independent group will scrutinize labor practices at the farms that supply cocoa to the Swiss food company.
Global food giant Nestle said it will begin a new initiative to end child labor in the cocoa industry. The company engaged the Fair Labor Association to examine its supply chains throughout Ivory Coast, the world's biggest exporter of cocoa, in a bid to find out exactly where children are working.
The chocolate industry is worth over $90 billion (69 billion euros) a year, but, 10 years after promising to end child labor, fair trade groups said chocolate producers have done little to honor their commitments.
In 2001, the world's biggest chocolate producers, including Nestle, signed what has become known as the cocoa protocol, an international agreement to end child labor in the cocoa industry. The move came amid growing evidence that tens of thousands of children were working planting and harvesting cocoa plants. many had been trafficked from neighboring countries, most were denied the chance to go to school.
Talk but no action
But in the 10 years since, little progress has been made, and some non-governmental organizations are threatening legal action against the big chocolate producers, in the hope the subsequent publicity may shame them into action.
Children have provided cheap labor on cocoa plantations, NGOs said That threat of legal action and unwelcome media attention may be one reason why Nestle has decided to act. The company has been, as even some of its managers privately admit ""the company everyone loves to hate"" because of the scandal surrounding its sale of baby milk formula to the developing world. Nestle Vice-President Jose Lopez said he is determined to face up to the issue, even if his promised investigation into child labor yields some very uncomfortable truths. ""We are sure that there are children working in Nestle's supply chain,"" he admitted. ""But we are not even sure what that supply chain looks like: the trade of cocoa is not a simple process, there are a number of intermediaries. I am not in a position to say there is no child labor. I might not be able to say that for a number of years with certainty and with guarantees."" The reason there is such little clarity, chocolate producers said, is because the business of growing cocoa is complicated, and lacks transparency. Cocoa beans grown on hundreds of thousands of small farms across Ivory Coast are purchased by intermediaries, who may not be interested in checking for child labor, before being sold on to buyers for the chocolate companies. In order to take a closer look at the long chain of supply from farm to chocolate bar, Nestle engaged the services of the Fair Labor Association (FLA), a not-for profit organization which works with companies such as Nike, Adidas, and clothing giant Hennes and Mauritz. Hundreds of cocoa beans go into a kilogram of chocolate Nestle is the first food producer on FLA's books, and association president Auret van Heerden said examining thousands of small farms across Ivory Coast will be a far more challenging exercise than for example checking out a Nike factory. ""We take every task from the moment they decide to plant a crop, clear the land, and plant it,” he said. ""We break it down: who sprays, who plants, who harvests, and we attach a risk to each task, and we know in which week each task and each risk will occur and we know when the risk of child labor is highest."" Game changer for food production After evaluating the times when child labor is most likely, van Heerden said the association would travel to a selection of farms supplying Nestle to conduct unannounced analysis of labor practices. The FLA said it expects to have initial results from inspections of Ivory Coast cocoa farms in the spring of 2012. Nestle said it will publish the association's finding and recommentations in their entirety. Van Heerden said he believes Nestle's decision could pressure other chocolate producers, and indeed other food manufacturers, into taking action too. ""Nestle, given that it is the leading food company, has the capacity to set off a race to the top,"" he said. ""Once Nestle tackles this in the robust way that we will, the spotlight is going to be on the other food producers, and consumers and the media are going to be saying, 'What are you doing about Ivory Coast?' This could really be a game changer for the food sector."" Consumer guilt Other NGOs are watching the Nestle policy and said consumer pressure has been instrumental in pushing for change, according to Steve Chalke of the anti child labor group Stop the Traffik. Nestle booked some 28 billion euros in profits in 2010
""The change in attitude of Nestle and other big chocolate manufacturers is because their shareholders know they can't get away with this anymore,"" Chalke said.
""There is a change of will, but I think that change is driven by a desire to survive,"" Chalke added. ""As long as consumers are willing to say I don't eat chocolate that is not fairly traded and I do not eat chocolate that has slavery as part of its production, then this will to change will persist on the part of Nestle and their rivals.""
Nestle's Lopez didn't argue with that interpretation, in fact he took it further. While he may have personal moral and ethical objections to children harvesting cocoa beans for Nestle, his real objection is a hard-headed business one: across the developing world the demand for chocolate is increasing fast, and, he said, a supply chain based on child labor simply will not efficiently deliver the huge amounts of cocoa required.
""We are just not willing to accept that [child labor] anymore,"" he said. ""Not because Nestle has turned into a wonderful NGO, but because the supply chain. There is a simple sustainability issue there, if we don’t worry about the supply side, the life of the farmers, there will be no cocoa.""
Lopez admitted Nestle's policy would end up adding to the company's cocoa bill.
""Yes, we are going to have to pay more,"" he said. ""Hopefully there will come a day when consumers realize that they too must pay more. It's not just for Nestle, it’s for society to pay more.""

Zara does not have sufficient oversight of its supply chain. New findings of the Brazilian labour inspection, released by Repórter Brasil today, describe numerous labour rights violations in the company’s supply chain. A research report by SOMO and Repórter Brasil also released today reaches the same conclusion.
In 2011, Brazilian inspectors found cases of modern-day slavery in Zara’s supply chain. After the scandal, Zara promised improvements by monitoring its supply chain more closely. The new inspection findings and the research report reveal that Zara is not living up to the agreements made with the Brazilian authorities at that time. In addition, the research report exposes Zara’s dodgy legal strategy to avoid liability for Brazilian labour rights abuses.

From moral responsibility to legal liability?
Modern day slavery conditions in the global garment supply chain and the need to strengthen regulatory frameworks
Zara is one of the brands of Inditex, the world’s largest clothing retailer measured in number of stores. The company’s popularity stems from its unique ability to deliver the latest catwalk trends to its shops at affordable prices and at record speed. This is achieved not just by managing its own factories, but also by means of a large network of suppliers spread across several countries, who must be able to work fast and flexibly. To meet tight deadlines and to be able to complete unanticipated orders, manufacturers may subcontract certain production processes or even shift complete orders to other factories and workplaces, often without informing the buyer. This way of working has spawned an obscure supply chain which was revealed by Brazilian inspectors in 2011. They discovered that orders from Zara ended up at illegal workshops, where undocumented immigrants from Bolivia and Peru were working and living under inhumane conditions.
Lack of compliance with agreement
These inspections are part of a package of measures that the Brazilian government has rolled out in order to detect and address modern-day slavery. After the inspections, Brazilian authorities reached an agreement with Zara in which the company committed itself to carry out better and more frequent supplier inspections in order to avoid infringements. The report by SOMO and Repórter Brasil reveals that Zara is still not monitoring its production chain sufficiently, and that the company is not living up to the reporting requirements specified in the agreement. This is confirmed by the recent report of the Brazilian labour inspection that Repórter Brasil had access to. According to this report sixty-seven suppliers were checked, and were found to be engaged in countless labour rights violations, such as excessive overtime and occupational health and safety violations.
Irresponsible legal strategy
To make things worse, Zara is pursuing a legal strategy in Brazil that is potentially very harmful. The 2011 inspections put Zara at risk of entering the so-called ‘dirty list’ of Brazil’s labour and employment ministry – a registry of companies caught employing workers in conditions analogous to slavery. Zara pushed back by filing a law suit claiming that the list was unconstitutional. The company may purposely invalidate a very effective legal instrument with this defence strategy. In recent years, Brazil’s unique approach, combining inspections, prosecutions and making public the list of perpetrators, has rescued 45,000 people from situations that could accurately be described as modern-day slavery.
According to SOMO and Repórter Brasil, this legal strategy is inconsistent with Zara’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy. Whereas Inditex promises customers decent conditions under which its products are manufactured, in court, the company argues that it cannot offer any guarantees.
SOMO and Repórter Brasil’s report demonstrates that with the current structure of the garment supply chain it is indeed nearly impossible to assure that products are made under decent conditions. However, companies such as Zara, who benefit from the way the supply chain is structured, should not be allowed to dodge their responsibilities. SOMO and Repórter Brasil argue that corporations with such strong purchasing power, and that pressure for low prices and tight delivery deadlines, are in fact contributing to human rights abuses. Precisely for this reason they should be held liable for human rights violations in their production chains. Supply chain liability is nothing more than a legal basis to hold companies to account for what fashion companies like Zara say they are already doing: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights violations. The organisations also call on the Brazilian government to strengthen the legal basis of the dirty list so that it can withstand attacks by companies such as Zara.

Zara pushed back by filing a law suit claiming that the list was unconstitutional. The company may purposely invalidate a very effective legal instrument with this defence strategy. In recent years, Brazil’s unique approach, combining inspections, prosecutions and making public the list of perpetrators, has rescued 45,000 people from situations that could accurately be described as modern-day slavery.
According to SOMO and Repórter Brasil, this legal strategy is inconsistent with Zara’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy. Whereas Inditex promises customers decent conditions under which its products are manufactured, in court, the company argues that it cannot offer any guarantees.
SOMO and Repórter Brasil’s report demonstrates that with the current structure of the garment supply chain it is indeed nearly impossible to assure that products are made under decent conditions. However, companies such as Zara, who benefit from the way the supply chain is structured, should not be allowed to dodge their responsibilities. SOMO and Repórter Brasil argue that corporations with such strong purchasing power, and that pressure for low prices and tight delivery deadlines, are in fact contributing to human rights abuses. Precisely for this reason they should be held liable for human rights violations in their production chains. Supply chain liability is nothing more than a legal basis to hold companies to account for what fashion companies like Zara say they are already doing: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights violations. The organisations also call on the Brazilian government to strengthen the legal basis of the dirty list so that it can withstand attacks by companies such as Zara.

Nestle signed an agreement in 2001 aimed at ending the use of child labour on cocoa farms
The food company Nestle has been accused of failing to carry out checks on child labour and other abuses in part of its cocoa supply chain.
A report by an independent auditor, the Fair Labor Association (FLA), says it found ""multiple serious violations"" of the company's own supplier code.
The code includes clauses on child labour, safety and working hours.
Cocoa is the raw product that makes chocolate in a global industry worth more than $90bn (£58bn) a year.
Earlier reports found that 1.8 million children in West Africa are at risk of abuse through dangerous child labour.
After increasing pressure, Nestle, which is the world's biggest food company, commissioned the FLA to map its cocoa supply chain in the Ivory Coast from where almost half the world's cocoa comes.
Rampant injuries
FLA investigators tracked the journey of cocoa from the poorest and most remote villages to the exporters that sold directly to Nestle.
They found that while Nestle insisted their primary suppliers - mostly big multi-nationals - agree to their code, it often went no further, despite Nestle knowing the supply chain involved many other stages.
""Now that its supply chain has been mapped,"" says FLA President Auret van Heerden, ""Nestle will be held accountable.
""For too long child labour in cocoa production has been everybody's problem and therefore nobody's responsibility.
Injuries caused by machetes, which are used to harvest cocoa pods, have been reported
""Nestle is taking direct responsibility for decreasing the risks.""
The report also found rampant injuries, mainly with machetes that slice into the children's legs as they harvest the cocoa pods, as well as both adults and children working long hours without pay.
There has been evidence of child labour on the Ivory Coast cocoa farms for many years.
In 2001, under pressure from the US congress, Nestle and other major chocolate companies signed an agreement to end the problem - but little was achieved.
'Top priority'
The FLA says this is the first time a multi-national chocolate producer has allowed its procurement system to be completely traced and assessed.
It believes the flaws it uncovered apply to all the big chocolate companies.
They say they are studying the findings.
Nestle has now laid out a detailed plan to try to solve the problem.
""The use of child labour in our cocoa supply chain goes against everything we stand for,"" says Nestle's Executive Vice-President for Operations Jose Lopez.
""No company sourcing cocoa from the Ivory Coast can guarantee that it doesn't happen, but we can say that tackling child labour is a top priority for our company.""
For more than 10 years, Ivory Coast has suffered civil war and unrest, much of which activists blame on the fight between rival groups for the tens of millions of dollars earned from cocoa.
The new government that came to power last year has introduced initiatives against child labour and exploitation.
Nestle and the FLA say that if the problem is to be totally eradicated the role of government will be critical."ÿÿNestle 'failing' on child labour

UBS admitted to rigging the Libor rate and was already fined back in 2012.
(Keystone)
The leading Swiss bank UBS has agreed to pay an additional $68 million (CHF67.3 million) to settle an investigation into the bank's role in manipulating an interest rate in the United States.
Justice officials said the bank made millions in unjust gains from fraudulent conduct while government entities investing with the bank were left in the dark.
It is the latest of several bank settlements of charges related to the manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate, better known as Libor.
UBS has paid more than $1.5 billion in fines and penalties to US and European authorities for its manipulation of the Libor.
The investigation involved attorneys general of 40 US states. They previously reached Libor-related settlements with the British multinational investment bank, Barclays, as well as Deutsche Bank and CitiBank, collecting nearly $500 million.
Libor is set every day and is a widely quoted interest rate used to price a myriad of financial instruments. The interest rates on credit cards and mortgages typically use Libor as a benchmark.
""Our multistate investigation will continue in order to hold accountable those other banks which harmed consumers in Connecticut and across the country,"" Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen is quoted as saying.
The plot by multiple banks came to light in 2012 shaking trust in the global financial system, according to experts. It is considered on the biggest scams in the history of the markets.

(CNN)Federal prosecutors in the United States on Thursday announced criminal charges against 16 FIFA officials, alleging they were part of a 24-year scheme to enrich themselves while overseeing the world governing body of soccer.
The 92-count indictment, which includes charges of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud, expands a corruption case that began in May with charges against 14 officials associated with FIFA and related sports marketing companies.
The announcement came the same day Swiss police arrested two FIFA officials on suspicion of accepting ""millions of dollars"" in bribes, according to a statement from the Swiss Federal Office of Justice.
Alfredo Hawit, the president of CONCACAF, the governing body for North and Central America as well as the Caribbean, and Juan Angel Napout, president of CONMEBOL, which presides over South America, were the two latest arrests in what is proving a miserable year for the organization in charge of running one of the world's most popular sports.
Its 79-year-old president, Sepp Blatter, and another leading official, Michel Platini -- the Union of European Football Associations president -- are currently suspended for 90 days after the Swiss attorney general opened criminal proceedings.
And in May, 14 executives with ties to FIFA were accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million.
Arrests in Zurich requested by U.S.
The Swiss Federal Office of Justice confirmed the identities of Hawit, a Honduran citizen, and Napout, who is from Paraguay, in a statement and revealed they are both opposing their extradition to the U.S.
The arrests in Zurich early Thursday were part of an operation requested by U.S. authorities, as the U.S. Department of Justice prepared to announce a new round of charges against multiple officials and executives tied to alleged corruption at FIFA.
""On the instructions of the (Swiss) Federal Office of Justice, a further two FIFA officials were arrested in Zurich today,"" the statement read.
""They are being held in custody pending their extradition. According to U.S. arrest requests, they are suspected of accepting bribes of millions of dollars.
""The high-ranking FIFA officials are alleged to have taken the money in return for selling marketing rights in connection with football tournaments in Latin America, as well as World Cup qualifying matches.
""According to the arrest requests, some of the offenses were agreed and prepared in the USA. Payments were also processed via U.S. banks,"" the statement added, explaining why the U.S. was in a position to ask for the arrests.
The move represents an escalation in the U.S. corruption probe that has already thrown FIFA into disarray.
FIFA released a statement saying it was aware of the arrests of two of its officials.
""FIFA will continue to cooperate fully with the U.S. investigation as permitted by Swiss law, as well as with the investigation being led by the Swiss Office of the Attorney General. FIFA will have no further comment on today's developments.""
Accusations of racketeering
In May, U.S. prosecutors unveiled a 47-count indictment against 14 executives with ties to FIFA and companies with commercial ties to the organization.
They accused FIFA officials of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million and in return providing ""lucrative media and marketing rights"" to soccer tournaments as kickbacks over the past 24 years.
Those charges included racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.
Swiss police, acting on requests by the U.S., launched predawn raids at a luxury hotel in Zurich to arrest seven of those charged in the May indictments.
Several of those charged have now surrendered to U.S. authorities in New York under agreements to cooperate with the FBI investigation, according to U.S. law enforcement officials.
Separately, Swiss officials have been investigating corruption allegations surrounding the next two football World Cups. FIFA's flagship tournament is set to be held in Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022.
Both Russia and Qatar have publicly denied any wrongdoing with regard to the bidding processes of the two tournaments."ÿÿFIFA arrests: U.S. charges 16 FIFA officials - CNN

Image caption
California is now in its fifth year of drought
Nestle extracted 36 million gallons of water from a national forest in California last year to sell as bottled water, even as Californians were ordered to cut their water use because of a historic drought in the state.
And the permit that Nestle uses to operate its water pipeline in the San Bernardino national forest costs just $524 (£357) a year.
That rankles with some residents and environmental groups, who want the US government to cut off Nestle's access to the water until an environmental study can be conducted.
Nestle has the legal rights to the water, and Arrowhead water has been bottled from springs here since 1894.
Yet the firm's permit to operate this seven-mile pipeline in the mountains expired in 1988, though since it pays its yearly $524, the licence is still considered valid by the US Forest Service and by Nestle.
However, activists consider the permit expired and the US government is now reviewing Nestle's licence. A public comment period has just closed and this month a federal hearing will consider the legality of the permit.
""The forest service should protect the forest,"" says Amanda Frye, a resident who's becoming known as a water rights activist. ""A healthy forest produces a healthy population of people. We need the forest.""
Remote pipeline
But bottled water is also healthy compared to sweet, fizzy soft drinks. And Americans are drinking more bottled water than ever - indeed water is on track to outsell other non-alcoholic soft drinks by 2017, says the Beverage Marketing Corporation.
The seven mile pipeline runs through difficult terrain
Nestle Waters' natural resource manager Larry Lawrence says the company has no plans to stop bottling water, largely because of public demand.
At the heart of the legal battle is Strawberry Creek, a remote area in the mountains, which would take hours to hike to. Mr Lawrence invited the BBC on a helicopter ride to the creek for an interview - and to show that it is vibrant, lush environment.
It took just seven minutes to get there in a helicopter, flying low through canyons following the pipeline as it snakes up the mountain to the creek.
""I don't see that evidence,"" Mr Lawrence says when asked if the creek were being deprived by the bottled water operations.
Oversight challenge
He speaks as we hike down to the small creek next to the pipeline, through poison oak and nettles. The water ""is all collected naturally"", he says, and the amount taken depends on the year and rainfall.
In 2015, it was 36 million gallons, compared with 28 million gallons in 2014, he says.
It is relatively lush and beautiful on the mountain, presumably partly due to recent rain. It snowed and hailed a bit while we were there in a sudden and much-needed April storm. But locals say it used to be a much healthier ecosystem.
Nestle's Larry Lawrence says the company has no plans to stop selling the water it bottles from the spring
Gary Earney is retired from the forest service but used to be in charge of managing the relationship with Nestle. ""I'm the only one who's ever hiked the length of the pipeline as far as I know,"" he says.
Bureaucracy and budget cuts in the US government are to blame for the lack of oversight, he argues.
The last time the forest service planned to review the Nestle permit in 2003, the area was devastated by a massive wildfire. Mr Earney retired a few years later, but he now supports the lawsuit and wants to see the forest service make up for past mistakes.
""This is not the only place in the world where people are fighting Nestle,"" he says. ""In my opinion, Nestle is trying to corner the market on potable water and sell it.""
He describes the forest service relationship with Nestle as ""too chummy"", a claim the forest service and Nestle dismiss.
Growing protests
Michael O'Heaney, executive director of The Story of Stuff, which is one of the groups suing Nestle, says the licence should be considered legally invalid as it has expired, and says Nestle is operating with little or no scrutiny.
""We were hesitant to sue the forest service. They are a beleaguered federal agency and they are so focused on wildfires,"" he tells the BBC. ""We feel we've already accomplished something because they are reviewing it [the permit].""
California may bottle three billion gallons of water a year, but Los Angeles uses more tap water than that in a week
In the grand scheme of California's water problems, bottled water is a drop in the bucket. According to the International Bottled Water Association, about three billion gallons a year are used to make bottled water in California.
The city of Los Angeles, by comparison, uses more than that in a week in tap water.
But in a drought every drop counts, which is perhaps why there has been so much protest against Nestle in the past few years.
Mr Lawrence, who has been with the company for 13 years, says recent protests against Nestle Waters are unprecedented in California. He says the employees live and work in California and are as concerned about drought conditions as anyone else.
'I care about the creek'
US Forest Service hydrologist Robert Taylor says they have no idea how much water is too much to remove, because it's never been studied.
""We are not allowed to be arbitrary and capricious"" in making decisions on Nestle's permit, he says.
Retired forest service workers Gary Earney and Steve Loe (right) are critical of Nestle's operation in the San Bernardino national forest
Retired wildlife biologist Steve Loe, who worked at the forest service with Mr Earney and is also critical of Nestle's work on the mountain, says he feels he needs to speak out for future generations.

TOKYO— Toshiba Corp. TOSYY 1.37% , hoping to close the books on one of Japan’s biggest accounting scandals, said Monday that it had overstated its earnings by ¥224.8 billion ($1.9 billion) over seven years, more than four times the initial estimate.
After repeated delays to its earnings reports, the electronics and engineering conglomerate posted a net loss of ¥37.8 billion for the fiscal year ended in March, compared with a profit of ¥60.2 billion a year earlier. Japanese companies like Toshiba, with a fiscal year ending in March, typically report full-year results by May.
The company said Monday that it was taking steps to avoid a repeat of the scandal, which an independent panel said was caused by managers setting aggressive profit targets that subordinates couldn’t meet without inflating divisional results.
“I am strongly feeling the social responsibility of alarming and causing trouble to our 400,000 shareholders, including domestic and international investors, as well as our clients and the authorities concerned,” said Masashi Muromachi, who took over as president in July. “We will devote ourselves wholeheartedly to regain your trust and revive Toshiba under the new management,” he said at a news conference.
But Toshiba, which makes things as diverse as personal computers, semiconductors and nuclear plants, faces tough challenges. Its home-electronics and appliances arm is unprofitable, while the memory-chip business, Toshiba’s most reliable earner, faces pricing pressure because of a slowdown in demand from Chinese electronics companies.
The scandal has become an embarrassment for Japan Inc., unfolding less than four years after Olympus Corp. , the Japanese maker of cameras and medical equipment, was found to have hidden $1.5 billion of investment losses. The problems at Olympus served as an impetus for new corporate-governance guidelines that took effect this year.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Monday that the government will examine the Toshiba affair “strictly” to try to protect investors and ensure fair trading. “It’s very problematic that accurate information hadn’t been disclosed to the markets,” he told reporters.
The new tally followed the latest delay in the company’s financial filings, when it said last week it had discovered new irregularities. On Monday, Toshiba said these totaled ¥11.8 billion and included problems at several projects, including a hydroelectric power plant.
After originally forecasting a net profit of ¥120 billion for the year ended in March, the company reversed its guidance to a loss and delayed the results when accounting problems surfaced.
The tally provided Monday includes large write-downs in several Toshiba units, including nuclear-power plants, semiconductors and home appliances. These include an impairment charge of ¥41 billion related to the South Texas Project, which includes a plan to build two reactors at an existing nuclear plant near Bay City, Texas. Toshiba has been leading the effort to build the reactors, but it has been bogged down by the regulatory approval process and a business climate in the U.S. that has turned against nuclear power because of the high cost of building plants and the availability of inexpensive natural gas.
“ It’s very problematic that accurate information hadn’t been disclosed to the markets. ”
In response to the scandal, Toshiba shook up its management and board membership during the summer. Its three most recent presidents stepped down from their roles at the company: one of them as president, another as vice chairman and the third as an adviser.
On Monday, Toshiba nominated Shinzo Maeda, senior adviser to Shiseido Co. , as chairman. The appointments of Mr. Maeda and other new directors are set to be voted on at a shareholder meeting on Sept 30.
The company didn’t provide an earnings forecast for the current financial year, which ends in March 2016.
The ¥224.8 billion adjustment to Toshiba’s earnings over seven years involved pretax income. On a net basis, the reduction totaled ¥155.2 billion.
Toshiba’s shares, which have fallen sharply since the accounting problems were disclosed in April, rose 1.8% Monday.

Tech giant Apple has revealed that it cut carbon emissions by almost 14,000 tonnes in 2015, as the firm continued its drive to improve supply chain sustainability and ethics, its 2016 supplier responsibility report has revealed.
The latest report follows the news that 93 per cent of the tech giants global facilities are now running on renewable energy, announced at the latest iPhone SE unveiling event in California.
At the same event Apple executives introduced Liam, Apple’s iPhone-dissecting robot that can take apart a discarded cell phone every 11 seconds to recover valuable metals, including cobalt, lithium, gold, silver and platinum. It goes without saying that as a brand, Apple stands for innovation — innovation in its technology, design and product experience.
At the same time, like its peers and competitors in the electronics industry, it faces tough issues around labor and human rights in its relationships with its suppliers — some of which manage massive workforces in countries such as China.
Research has revealed consumers are increasingly conscious of the ethics of electronics companies. With allegations of child labour and extremely low wages in developing nations have dogged many companies and angered consumers over the years.
With a focus on the brands global impact, Apple has carried out an extensive auditing process that has seen the company slash emissions by 13,800 tonnes, save 3.8bn gallons of water and diverted more than 73,000 metric tonnes of waste from landfill.
Apple found that almost three-quarters of its total carbon footprint found in the supply chain
In letter published in the report, Apple’s chief operating officer Jeff Williams said:
“In 2015, work-hour compliance among our suppliers reached 97%, a number that is virtually unheard of in our industry. Since 2008, more than 9.2 million workers have been trained on their rights, more than 1.4 million people have participated in Apple educational programs, and more than $25.6m in excessive recruitment fees have been repaid to foreign contract workers by suppliers as a result of our efforts.
At the heart of this effort is Apple’s responsibility to the people who help make our products. Our commitment to them will never waver, and we will always try to do what is right by doing more and doing it better.”
The progress report shows extensive compliance changes have taken place regarding Apple’s ethical business practices, supply chain ethics and worker and labour rights.
As well as ensuring ethical practices are carried out in regards to child labour and 60-hour workweeks – 2015 saw compliance rise by 5% in this regard – Apple has put a greater emphasis on supply chain ethics in regards to conflict minerals.
After a five year effort which concluded in December, Apple is now independently auditing 100% of its suppliers over conflict minerals, which the company claims has ‘improved sourcing practices for smelters and the mining industry as a whole’.
For 2016 the company will focus on enhancing these practices by conversing with authorities over any related armed groups in areas where suppliers operate.

Image caption
A court ruled Lee should spend the next five years in prison
A year ago, simply finding a photograph of Lee Jae-yong was tricky.
He had just been elected to the board at Samsung Electronics, and one of the few images available showed him as a younger man, smiling, with a name badge clipped to a lilac V-neck sweater.
There is no shortage of pictures now, but smiles and upbeat knitwear were in limited supply.
Instead most images showed him handcuffed, flanked by police as he is moved between court and prison.
But now, a flicker of a smile has returned - after a court unexpectedly released him after deciding to cut his five-year jail term and to suspend the remaining sentence.
Who is Lee Jae-yong?
The 49-year-old, also known as Jay Y Lee, is the son of Lee Kun-hee, chairman of Samsung Group, Korea's largest conglomerate. He is also the grandson of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul.
With a degree from South Korea's top university and a doctorate from Harvard Business School, he has been groomed to take over the family firm.
He became a Samsung president in 2009 and in 2013 was made vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics, the division which makes gadgets from smartphones and televisions to cameras and hard drives.
But since Lee's father suffered a heart attack in 2014, he has been considered de facto boss of the entire Samsung group.
Forbes ranks the divorced father-of-two as the 40th most powerful person in the world, with a net worth of almost $6bn (£4.9bn).

Lee's biggest product launch to-date had been the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7
What was he accused of?
In February 2017, Lee Jae-yong was arrested and then charged over his alleged role in a political and corporate scandal linked to South Korea's then president, Park Geun-hye.
Charges against Lee included bribery, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and perjury.
Samsung was accused of paying 43bn won ($37.7m. £26.7m) to two non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Ms Park, in exchange for political support.
More specifically, the favours were alleged to include backing for a controversial Samsung merger which paved the way for Lee to become eventual head of the conglomerate, a deal that needed support from the government-run national pension fund.
Lee denied the charges. He admitted making donations but denied Samsung wanted anything in return. In August 2017 a court convicted him of the charges and sent him to prison for five years.
In February 2018, that sentence was halved, and Seoul High Court decided to suspend the jail term, meaning he was free to go.
What does this mean for Samsung?
Mr Lee's release will be a major relief to the world's biggest smartphone marker and arguably the most important company in corporate Korea.
You could see the immediate impact of that from the pop in Samsung's share price - a sign that investors were looking forward to Mr Lee back in the driving seat.
It may, or may not be, back to work as usual. Mr Lee wants to clear his name. Prosecutors want him back behind bars.
Samsung has sales equivalent to about a fifth of the country's GDP. To date it has appeared unaffected by Lee's absence, with Samsung Electronics posting record profits last year.
But there are also political consequences to this latest move.
South Korea's President Moon Jai-in came to office after campaigning to clean up the powerful chaebol sector in Korea - ending the special treatment for the business elite who run the chaebol, family-run companies crucial to the national economy.
Mr Lee has effectively been given a get out of jail card."ÿÿSamsung scandal: Who is Lee Jae-yong?

If I search for #Zara on Instagram, I can see well over 22m posts of people wearing clothing that was bought from the retailer, everywhere from Dublin to Dubrovnik, New York to Newport. If you’re reading this in an office, I’d bet you a tenner that someone, somewhere in the building is wearing a Zara shirt or jacket. In the UK, Zara has been a high-street fixture since 1998, and has a growing number of stores. Millions of us have brought the brand into our homes – and so millions of us should be shocked and infuriated by reports that factory workers in Istanbul have been hiding notes in the clothes that they have been producing for one of Zara’s suppliers, pleading for help. One note apparently read: “I made this item you are going to buy, but I didn’t get paid for it.” The workers were reportedly left unpaid after their factory shut down overnight.
Inditex, Zara’s parent company, has since promised to reimburse its sub-contractor’s workers as soon as possible. But the rise in rampant consumerism remains a worry. The value of the UK fashion industry has jumped to £26bn (up from £21bn in 2009) and fashion bucks broader growth trends – to put it simply, our appetite for new shoes and accessories is growing more quickly than our appetite for food. We know that our love of fast fashion is terrible for the environment. It was estimated that this spring Britons would send 235m pieces of clothing to landfill. Consumer debt levels are reaching an all-time high, and as retailers such as Asos are starting to offer credit options to their young customers, it’s scarily easy to spend money we don’t have on clothes we don’t need.
I wonder whether our failure to address the fast fashion problem is because it affects more women than men, at every level. Even though research conducted earlier this year found that British men typically spend more on their clothes than women, fashion and clothes are routinely dismissed as trivial, feminine interests. Women are exploited and mocked, disproportionately targeted by advertisers and then accused of being frivolous and fluffy for spending their hard-earned money on a shopping trip. That’s just at the consumer end. More seriously, it’s estimated that, of the estimated 60-75 million garment workers who are employed to make our clothes, 80% are women, working in dangerous conditions and not being paid a living wage, if they’re being paid at all. Globally, poverty affects women first. More than 70% of the world’s poorest people are women.
In 2013, Rana Plaza, a building in Bangladesh that housed five garment factories, collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people and injuring thousands more. At the time, the tragedy was believed to be a wake-up call, one that would permanently change the way that the goods we consume are produced. Yet just 17 brands have signed the Apparel and Footwear Supply Chain Transparency Pledge, and there has been a spate of fires in garment factories.
It’s too easy to dismiss the complaints of underpaid workers as a women’s problem. When we do this, we don’t acknowledge that every one of us is part of the solution, regardless of gender. I know many men and women who are horrified by the way so many of our clothes are produced, and are doing their best to consume more carefully, by introducing no-spend months or ensuring that they only ever buy second-hand clothes. However, we need a much more effective solution, and something that can be implemented at a higher level.
A globally agreed, industry-wide minimum wage and safety standards for all workers is imperative. It’s important that manufacturers would face serious, punitive consequences for failing to meet these standards. Ultimately the brands must take responsibility for making these changes – but even if consumers can’t lead this revolution, we can agitate for it.
The 2015 ethical consumer report shows that the ethical market in the UK has grown to £38bn, meaning the it is now worth twice as much as the tobacco market. The evidence suggests that we care about where our clothes come from, and we don’t necessarily want them to be produced as cheaply as possible – not when lives are at stake.
I’m not sure that the best way to support these workers is to stop shopping altogether. This action does not address the fact that the fashion industry could potentially be a positive space for women, and provide opportunities for them as skilled workers and consumers. It’s vital that we recognise the industry’s wider value. Paying the predominantly female workers properly might cut into profit margins, or force us to pay more for our jeans – but it gives workers the chance to lead happier, safer lives, to live in better conditions and to educate their children, which is ultimately going to provide an enormous boost to the global economy.
Analysts at Euromonitor predict that global demand for menswear will outstrip womenswear by 2020, a clear indicator that this isn’t simply a concern of just one half of the population. It’s time for every one of us to start taking fashion and its provenance seriously.

They are the ultimate status symbols for sports stars and street-conscious young people. With their trademark three stripes, Adidas clothes cost a small fortune to buy and are promoted by world-famous names such as England skipper David Beckham, Olympic heptathlete Denise Lewis and Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova.
But the company will this week become embroiled in controversy when the European Parliament hears of the barbaric treatment of employees in Indonesian sweatshop factories supplying the German conglomerate.
The Parliament will be told that clothes for Adidas were made in two factories using child labour, forced overtime and sexual harassment. Representatives of workers in two Indonesian factories supplying the German company,will tell Euro MPs that in the Nikomax Gemilang and Tuntex factories, in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, children as young as 15 were:
made to work 15-hour days.
expected to do at least 70 hours a week and punished for refusing to do overtime.
paid less than $60 a month, rates below the International Labour Organisation's demand for a living wage.
penalised for taking leave during medical difficulties and had illegal deductions taken from wages as punishments for minor misdemeanours.
Sports goods companies have been criticised for exploiting workers in the developing world before. There was a storm just before the 1998 World Cup, after footballs bearing the Manchester United club crest were being made by child labourers in India, working for as little as 6p an hour. Cricket ball manufacturers were also criticised.
A report by Christian Aid revealed that children, some as young as seven, were regularly used in the production of a wide range of sports goods in India. Most of the £13m worth of goods went to Britain.
Last year a worker from a Bangkok factory for Adidas claimed that for less than £1 per day she worked 12-hour shifts seven days a week, producing sportswear, shoes and replica kits for the company.
She claimed conditions were poor in the Thai factory and the management acted brutally to meet large orders within a limited time, often denying workers statutory rights such as holidays and sick pay. The accusations are similar to those made by the Indonesian workers.
The woman was eventually sacked in 1998 along with 23 others after they formed a union in an attempt to win more rights. The factory management claimed she was a disruptive influence.
Most Adidas goods are produced in Third World countries, particularly Asia, with orders awarded to locally run factories. Many orders are sub-contracted at local level, leading to claims that the companies have little idea of where and how their goods are produced.
Adidas denies ignoring workers' rights for the sake of profit, claiming they have strict labour codes and constantly monitoring wage levels and conditions to ensure a good working environment.
Adidas spokesman Peter Csanadi countered the allegations earlier this year: 'We have factories where the conditions are very good and we take this whole issue very seriously,' he said. 'We know we have had problems, and we had to terminate some contracts because we saw that the management were not interested in good working conditions.
'We work closely with factory management and demand that they ensure good conditions for workers. We also have a team of our own people who go to factories to sort out problems.'
Adidas, whose football shirts sell in a British high street store for more than £50, have admitted problems at the two Indonesian factories and have recently increased pay and taken steps to ease overtime demands. Copies of the labourers' identity cards are now held at the Nikomas factory to ensure that no under-18s work there.
The company admitted that at the Tuntex plant quotas were set too high. Workers complained of being fined for coming to work five minutes late. Adidas confirmed that women who took leave when menstruating, as legally entitled, lost an attendance bonus of 6,000 Rupiah (50p) and that a manager had been sacked for sexual harassment.
Pay at the Nikomas plant was increased to more than 9,000 Rs (75p per day) following the campaigners complaints, Adidas said.
The campaigners hope that the publicity surrounding the hearings next week will force states to become involved in the regulatory process.
Ingborg Wick, who oversaw much of the research, said yesterday that government involvement was crucial.
'There has to be some overview of voluntary codes that companies sign with campaigners. There also needs to be an institutional framework and legal monitoring to ensure social standards in Third World production,' she said.
The hearings - by the European Parliament's Development Committee - have been organised by Richard Howitt, the British MEP.

As controversy over G4S continues, another key company linked to the Olympics, the sportswear brand Adidas, has attempted to rebut criticism after staff at a flagship store blocked protesters who attempted target 'sweatshop' Games merchandise.
In the first nationwide direct action against a 2012 Olympics sponsor, campaigners attached '34p' tags to Adidas products at stores around Britain to indicate the minimal hourly wage rate paid to the Indonesian workers who make Adidas goods.
At the flagship Adidas store in London’s Oxford Street, activists tagged some products, but were prevented by staff from attaching tags to the company's Olympics range.
The UK-wide protests took place as the campaign group Labour Behind the Label claimed that the basic pay of Indonesian Adidas workers who make official Olympic merchandise is only £10 a week.
The group says Adidas are in breach of an agreement with LOCOG (the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games) which says suppliers must pay their workers a sustainable living wage.
Adidas has posted a blog on its website by William Anderson, head of social and environmental affairs for the Asia Pacific region, in which he seeks to justify the 34p an hour pay rate, despite the company's record £529 million net profit in 2011.
The blog, which revealed that workers supplying Adidas could in some instances be paid less than 34p an hour, has drawn public criticism.
Murray Worthy, who campaigns on sweatshops for the charity War on Want, said: “Adidas is clearly now on the rack through growing pressure over sweatshops. Thousands of our tags are being put on its products across the country. It is high time Adidas recognised exploitation is not OK and ensured a living wage for its factory workers.”
The charity has called on Adidas to tackle the abuse of workers’ rights in its supplier factories, as well as demanding a living wage, decent conditions and trade union rights for the workers concerned.
War on Want has also pointed out that Adidas estimates sales of its Olympic products to be worth £100 million, with four billion people expected to watch the global sports event on television.

Once everyone had worn the shoes about a month, Adidas planned to grind them up, melt them down back into raw material, and use them for the next generation of the Futurecraft.Loop.But first, it needed the shoes back. “Honestly one unexpected challenge was less on the technical side and more on the bring-back side,” says Dharan Kirupanantham, senior manager of future technology innovation at Adidas. “We didn’t get all the shoes back as quickly as possible.”It was one of the lessons Adidas learned as it prepares a public release of the shoes, currently scheduled for spring 2021. The Futurecraft.Loop is part of its effort to find feasible ways to “close the loop”—industry speak for turning old products into new ones with minimal virgin resources involved.Other fashion and sports brands have taken up this challenge as their environmental toll on the planet grows. Yesterday, Adidas unveiled the second generation of the Futurecraft.Loop, made from the first generation of shoes plus some recycled production waste and, still, a lot of virgin material.Right now, only about 10% of the material in generation two is recycled. According to Kirupanantham, while all material from the first generation is reused, it only appears in the second generation in parts such as the hard outsole, the tongue label, the eyestays, and some internal reinforcements. Kirupanantham adds the reason the recycled material is only used in a small percentage of the shoe is because it takes more time to turn it into things like fiber or Boost, the midsole cushioning Adidas uses on its running shoes. Doing it this way allows the company to develop much faster.Adidas still sees that 10% as a victory since it was able to recycle all the shoes regardless of their condition. I was a recipient of one of the first 200 pairs and wore them around New York City and on a hiking trip in New Mexico. They performed great, but I sent them back to Adidas quite dirty:Quartz/Marc BainDirty.Kirupanantham says some shoes had dye from jeans on them. Others looked hardly used. It took the company about six months to clean them, break them down, turn them back into new parts, and test their performance to make sure they were up to standard.One difference Adidas noticed in the recycled material was a slight beige tinge. Adidas also added some color to the new iterations to show it could liven up the shoe’s look without sacrificing design.The company’s ideal scenario is a one-to-one exchange: one old sneaker comes in, and a new one made entirely of the recycled material goes out. But Adidas is still discovering what’s possible. “It’s not something that’s ever been done before,” Kirupanantham says.Adidas isn’t sure, for instance, how many times it can recycle the shoes without degrading the material. Typically, each time plastic is recycled, its quality declines. With the help of its partner, chemical firm BASF, Adidas chose a process tailored to preserve the integrity of the plastic. But it won’t know more until it actually recycles the shoes several more times.In any case, it’s thrilled with the current progress. “This is another step for the industry, we feel, because we went ahead and actually did it,” Kirupanantham says. As for when generation three might come out, that’s to be determined."ÿÿAdidas is learning it’s not easy to make 100% recyclable sneakers

The Dallas Cowboys have a new merchandising arm that recently jumped into the business of producing college-logo apparel for leading universities, but the Cowboys subsidiary has already encountered a stubborn opponent — student groups that contend it is using overseas sweatshops.
At Ohio State, many students and professors are pressing the university’s administration not to sign a proposed multimillion-dollar deal with the Cowboys’ affiliate, Silver Star Merchandising. And at the University of Southern California, students returning to campus this fall are voicing outrage that their school signed an ambitious 10-year licensing deal with the Cowboys last May while keeping the negotiations secret from the students.
Natalie Yoon, president of the United Students Against Sweatshops chapter at Ohio State, said: “This proposed licensing deal is very problematic given the Dallas Cowboys’ labor history. Just skimming the surface, we found the Cowboys produced merchandise at four factories that have egregious sweatshop violations.”
That anti-sweatshop group, with more than 150 college chapters nationwide, said Silver Star Merchandising had used one factory in El Salvador that, according to monitoring groups, threatened union supporters, had drinking water that was contaminated and illegally forced employees to work huge amounts of overtime. The group cited a second El Salvador plant that factory monitors said had spied on union supporters and put them in worse jobs at lower pay.
United Students Against Sweatshops also said that Silver Star had manufacturing done at an Indonesian factory that suddenly closed, its owners fleeing, without paying $3 million in legally required severance pay owed to its 2,800 employees.

The Cowboys’ Silver Star Merchandising subsidiary acknowledges that it, like many other American apparel companies, has used some factories that had problems, but it said it was trying to improve conditions at those facilities.
“We are very serious about our social compliance responsibilities,” said Bill Priakos, Silver Star’s chief operating officer. “We have a very aggressive code of conduct for all factories representing our brand.”
In 1996, the Cowboys became the first football team to insist on handling its merchandise rights in-house. Jerry Jones, the team’s owner, sought to extend the team’s retail expertise last year by founding Silver Star, which says it is seeking to produce and distribute college-logo apparel for a limited number of prominent universities, starting with U.S.C. and Ohio State. His son Jerry Jones Jr. is Silver Star’s president.
The anti-sweatshop groups have tussled in recent years with Nike, Gap, Russell Athletic and other companies, pushing them to improve poor conditions at some of the factories they use. Now these groups have made Silver Star their newest target, arguing that it, as the new kid on the block, has not done its human rights homework and has an especially bad track record in using factories with violations.
Rick Van Brimmer, Ohio State’s director of trademark and licensing services, said his university would not consider a licensing deal with a company that did not take workers’ rights and codes of conduct seriously.
“Whether we are talking about prospective licensees or existing licensees,” he said, “we are committed to an aggressive and meaningful corporate social responsibility program.” He said this meant engaging with “companies that share those goals” and were willing to work on corrective measures.

Both Silver Star and Mr. Van Brimmer said their philosophy was not to walk away from a bad factory, but to press the factory to make needed changes.
Julia Wang, a U.S.C. sophomore who is a co-president of the school’s Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, said students were angry that they learned of their school’s Cowboys deal only through news reports.
“We asked how they managed to sign a deal with the Cowboys without any student input when there are all these widely known cases of sweatshop abuse in some of the factories they use,” Ms. Wang said. “We asked, ‘What are you going to do about it?’ and again and again all we’ve gotten are wishy-washy answers. We’re looking for improved policies and action.”
U.S.C. officials defended Silver Star, maintaining that it, like the school’s other apparel licensees, was intent on working with universities and factory owners to ensure that the factories complied with codes of conduct. U.S.C. officials declined to discuss the scope or value of the contract, although they said total sales of U.S.C.-themed merchandise exceeded $20 million a year.
Matthew Curran, U.S.C.’s director of trademark, licensing and social responsibility, said the school required all licensees to comply with a strict code of conduct that barred factories from violating labor laws and having abusive conditions. Mr. Curran said that his university’s agreement with the Cowboys would enable U.S.C. to consolidate more of its marketing and distribution with a small group of companies.
“We believe this will give us and other parties involved an enhanced ability to track, monitor and to ideally have greater influence on those factories,” he said.
When the PT Kizone factory in Indonesia closed without paying $3 million in severance, Nike, one of the factory’s major customers, said it and one of its middlemen would put up $1.5 million toward severance. Teresa Cheng, international campaigns coordinator with United Students Against Sweatshops, complained that Silver Star had been very reluctant to help pay for severance.
“We went to the Cowboys and asked them to tell us the name of one factory they used that complied with Ohio State’s code of conduct, and they couldn’t name a single factory,” Ms. Cheng said.
Mr. Curran of U.S.C. defended Silver Star, saying it stopped doing business with PT Kizone before the factory closed — an assertion the student group contests. Mr. Curran said Silver Star was not contractually or legally responsible to help pay severance, but it “has been in contact” with “other stakeholders in an effort to find a resolution.”
As for the two El Salvador factories, Mr. Priakos of Silver Star said his company represented less than 5 percent of their production. He said a monitoring group was working with the factories to ensure that the factories came into compliance with the law and codes of conduct.
Ms. Yoon, mentioning a November 2010 e-mail by Mr. Van Brimmer, Ohio State’s licensing director, said the university had an unfair, telescoped selection process that unduly favored Silver Star. In that e-mail, Mr. Van Brimmer told Silver Star: “I may be forced into looking at ‘bids’ simply because we are a state agency. But don’t fear that process.”
Mr. Van Brimmer said the process was transparent, thorough, competitive and fair, adding, “No one was promised anything, and to classify it as a ‘charade’ is blatantly untrue, unfair and disrespectful,” to all those involved in the process."ÿÿStudents Object to Use of Sweatshop Labor on College Clothing

 Published May 29, 2019 by .  National Geographic’s new miniseries The Hot Zone is based on Richard Preston’s book The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story, which details 1989’s real-life Ebola-Reston crisis.The facts behind The Hot Zone are what nightmares are made of—only the situation wasn’t a dream. It was real, it was terrifying, and it’s far from over.Ebola in the U.S.In 1989, dozens of macaque monkeys were shipped from the Philippines to a facility in Reston, Virginia, owned by Hazleton Laboratories (now known as Covance). They were intended to be sold to laboratories for experimentation—but they never made it that far. After arriving in Reston, many suddenly and inexplicably died.Hazleton enlisted help from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. No one was prepared for what the initial testing turned up: Ebola.25 years ago in Virginia, a very different Ebola outbreak – http://t.co/67ng87GX0w pic.twitter.com/oqZ6FiKfo0— CBS News (@CBSNews) August 10, 2014In addition to the dozens of monkeys who died, four workers at the facility were infected with what was a previously undiscovered strain of the virus, later dubbed Ebola-Reston. Hazleton had unwittingly introduced infected monkeys into the country and unleashed an Ebola outbreak in Reston—the first known case of Ebola on U.S. soil.Spoiler alert: Experimenters killed the remaining macaques. For anyone interested in reading the book or watching the miniseries, we’ll keep a lid on the rest.The U.S. Didn’t Learn Its LessonIf the 1989 incident taught us anything, it’s that shipping monkeys and other animals from abroad to torment and ultimately kill them is dangerous—for everyone. But that hasn’t stopped animal-experimenting companies from continuing to engage in the practice. In 1996, for example, Ebola-Reston returned to the U.S. via—you guessed it—monkeys who had been shipped to Texas from the Philippines. Again, workers were affected.For the sake of animals and public safety, this practice needs to end.Even today, 30 years since the unprecedented Ebola outbreak in Virginia, this dreadful business is still being conducted. PETA has persuaded every major airline in the world—with the exception of Air France—to stop transporting primates to laboratories.Just like those shipped from the Philippines in 1989 and 1996, the monkeys Air France transports today are either bred in captivity on squalid farms or snatched from the wild, torn away from their homes and families.© Jo-Anne McArthur/We AnimalsA breeder shows off a new mother while her baby clings to her.They’re then crammed into cramped wooden crates in cargo holds on passenger and cargo flights and forced to endure a dark and terrifying journey.Jo-Anne McArthur / Maximum Tolerated DoseWhen it’s time to transport them, monkeys are locked in small shipping crates.Once in the U.S., they’re transported to dealers such as Primate Products and to laboratories—including Covance, one of the largest importers of monkeys in the U.S.—where they’re imprisoned and tormented in experiments.During an 11-month investigation at a Covance laboratory in Vienna, Virginia, a PETA investigator uncovered many horrors: For instance, workers struck, choked, and screamed obscenities at frightened and “uncooperative” monkeys. As a result of our investigation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture cited and fined Covance for serious violations of the Animal Welfare Act and the laboratory eventually shut down.Urge Air France to Stop Supporting This Ethically Reprehensible PracticeThe kindest thing you can do for these animals is to refuse to fly with Air France until the company adopts and adheres to a formal policy prohibiting the transport of monkeys to laboratories.

Amazon.com was last night accused of operating the worst of old economy working practices at a giant warehouse dispatching books, music, DVDs and other goods bought over the internet across Britain.
Staff working for the world's biggest e-commerce trader at its Marston Gate depot near Milton Keynes have made a series of complaints to the Guardian about wages and conditions in the company.
The singer-songwriter Billy Bragg is threatening to organise a boycott of Amazon and the GPMU print and paper union, which has launched a recruitment drive at the site, will next week ask Acas, the advisory, conciliation and arbitration service, to intervene.
Union organiser Peter Lockhart said: ""Behind the shiny facade of Amazon and the internet are poor pay, poor conditions, poor communications and poor management. It is anything but 'new age' inside that distribution centre.""
The US firm, trading in Britain as Amazon.co.uk, yesterday strongly denied the allegations and said pay rates were comparable with those of other firms in the area.
""We are a hugely open and democratic company and we believe we do the very best for our employees,"" a spokeswoman said.
But GPMU officials believe the discontent explodes the myth of a groovier dot.com capitalism behind the technological slickness of online shopping with its discounts and home deliveries.
A number of workers who spoke on condition that their identities were not disclosed were highly critical of conditions in the giant green and white depot 200 yards from junction 13 on the M1.
According to employees, supervisors known as ""leads"" and managers continually clock-watch staff. One employee claimed that they shout at those who fail to meet demanding targets.
Staff say strict quotas are imposed with a ""picker"" forced to select three items a minute from the warehouse's shelves and a ""packer"" to parcel an average 2.5 orders a minute.
One employee claimed they were required to push a trolley for what felt like up to 20 miles in a night to fill it with books and CDs named on computer-printed lists. The company said the distance was ""nowhere like that"".
The 11-hour night shift stretching from 7.30pm to 6.30am includes an unpaid one-hour meal break at 1am and Marston Gate has no canteen, staff taking in their own food or using vending machines. Two shorter rest periods, however, are paid.
The union said a standard 23 days' holiday included bank holidays, and the pay rate is £5.50 an hour plus a £1 hourly bonus for night staff who are rostered four shifts a week.
""They offer the minimum needed to hire people around Milton Keynes and don't seem to care about the turnover,"" said Mr Lockhart.
An employee claimed that ethnic miniority staff felt they were frequently overlooked for promotion, an allegation denied particularly forcefully by Amazon which said in recent months two black or Asian employees had been appointed to management posts.
Managers recently took handwriting samples from staff after a note criticising the working conditions was sent out with an order by a disgruntled worker.
""They are looking at you all the time. It is not pleasant,"" said one employee.
Another said: ""I need the job but I would not advise my friends to work there. It's not good. If they say I am valued, they have a funny way of showing it. They don't care about us.""
Union leaders intend to make Amazon a test case to break into the unorganised dot.com sector and the GPMU, which had four members at Amazon last October, has signed up 92 out of an estimated workforce of 270 after a recruitment campaign.
The union said that last autumn Amazon rebuffed GPMU overtures to secure bargaining rights but Mr Lockhart said the union has since passed the 10% threshold in law to trigger a recognition ballot. The company said it had met the union but had received ""no formal communication"".
Another option the union is considering is to continue recruiting with the aim of enrolling 50% of the workforce plus at least one other since that would guarantee automatic recognition.
Amazon, which has its UK head office in Slough, said yesterday wages were competitive ""within the bands"" around Milton Keynes and staff were provided with private medical insurance and share options, although the options have plunged since the collapse in the value of internet firms.
The spokeswoman said: ""There are obviously two sides to this. We really believe that we do the best for our workforce and the feedback that we have is positive.""
Amazon has a company council, including representatives of the workforce, which the dot.com maintains allowed open debate and the GPMU insists is dominated by management.

An animal rights group hopes to put an end to foie gras by ruffling Amazon’s feathers.
Following an investigation in which it claims to have uncovered habitual animal cruelty at the largest foie gras producer in the United States, Mercy for Animals, a Los Angeles-based activist group, launched a campaign called Amazon Cruelty, which is calling on Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to ban foie gras products from its website.
Production of foie gras, which is made from enlarged duck or goose livers, is highly controversial as it is believed to involve gross mistreatment of the animals. The food product is illegal in several countries and was banned in California last summer, a move that stirred the ire of President Francois Hollande in France, where the dish is considered a delicacy.
In a phone interview, Ari Solomon, director of communications for Mercy for Animals, said the dish is no treat for the ducks that are “tortured” to create it.
“The process involves force-feeding ducks by shoving metal tubes into their mouths, which produces a diseased liver,” he said.
Solomon said the Amazon Cruelty campaign was launched after a recent investigation in which an activist went undercover as an employee at Hudson Valley Foie Gras, LLC, in upstate New York, which is believed to be the largest producer of foie gras in the country. He said the person worked there for a little less than a month, and during that time, documented animal abuse with a video camera.
Disturbing video posted to AmazonCruelty.com shows graphic images of dead and bloodied ducks, as well as workers grabbing ducks around the necks and forcefully shoving tubes into their mouths. Solomon said the footage was shot at Hudson Valley Foie Gras.
Marcus Henley, operations manager for Hudson Valley, did not immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment. The facility has long defended its methods, however, and has even invited skeptics to visit Hudson Valley Foie Gras and see for themselves. In a video uploaded to YouTube in 2009, details what it called the “Hudson Valley Method” of foie gras production, which it says was developed with the help of duck physiologists and animal-behavior scientists. It says the method causes no harm to ducks.
Mercy for Animals disagrees. For its new campaign, the group says it is targeting Amazon because the online behemoth stands apart from large retailers like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Safeway Inc. (NYSE:SWY) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), all of which have refused to sell foie gras. According to a petition on the Amazon Cruelty website, Amazon has come down on the side of animal rights in the past, barring the sale of whale meat, shark-fin soup and animal-fighting videos.
Amazon, which is typically tight-lipped in the face of public criticism, did not respond to a request for comment, and Solomon said his group has yet to hear from the company on the matter.
Currently, a search for “foie gras” on Amazon.com calls up 2,587 results.

Amazon, which got its start selling books and still bills itself as “Earth’s most customer-centric company,” has officially entered the surveillance business.
The company has developed a powerful and dangerous new facial recognition system and is actively helping governments deploy it. Amazon calls the service “Rekognition.”
Marketing materials and documents obtained by ACLU affiliates in three states reveal a product that can be readily used to violate civil liberties and civil rights. Powered by artificial intelligence, Rekognition can identify, track, and analyze people in real time and recognize up to 100 people in a single image. It can quickly scan information it collects against databases featuring tens of millions of faces, according to Amazon.
Amazon is marketing Rekognition for government surveillance. According to its marketing materials, it views deployment by law enforcement agencies as a “common use case” for this technology. Among other features, the company’s materials describe “person tracking” as an “easy and accurate” way to investigate and monitor people. Amazon says Rekognition can be used to identify “people of interest,” raising the possibility that those labeled suspicious by governments — such as undocumented immigrants or Black activists — will be seen as fair game for Rekognition surveillance. It also says Rekognition can monitor “all faces in group photos, crowded events, and public places such as airports,” at a time when Americans are joining public protests at unprecedented levels.
Amazon’s Rekognition raises profound civil liberties and civil rights concerns. Today, the ACLU and a coalition of civil rights organizations demanded that Amazon stop allowing governments to use Rekognition.

Tell Amazon to get out of the surveillance business
Amazon not only markets Rekognition as a law enforcement service, it is helping governments deploy it. Amazon lists the city of Orlando, Florida, and the Washington County Sheriff’s Office in Oregon among its customers. Upon learning this, the ACLU Foundations of California coordinated with the ACLU of Oregon and the ACLU of Florida on public records requests to learn more.
The documents we obtained indicate that the Washington County sheriff and the city of Orlando became Rekognition customers in 2017. Washington County has since built a database of at least 300,000 mugshot photos to use in coordination with Rekognition. It also built a mobile app for its deputies to quickly scan for a match against the county’s database by submitting images obtained from surveillance or other sources.
Amazon is providing company resources to help government agencies deploy Rekognition. In emails between Amazon and Washington County employees, the company offers the expertise of the Rekognition product team, troubleshoots problems encountered by the county, and provides “best practices” advice on how to deploy the service. In what Orlando’s police chief praises as a “first-of-its-kind public-private partnership,” Amazon promised free consulting services to build a Rekognition “proof of concept” for the city. Rekognition face surveillance is now operating across Orlando in real-time, according to Amazon, allowing the company to search for “people of interest” as footage rolls in from “cameras all over the city.”
In the records, Amazon also solicits feedback and ideas for “potential enhancements” to Rekognition’s capabilities for governments. Washington County even signed a non-disclosure agreement created by Amazon to get “insight into the Rekognition roadmap” and provide additional feedback about the product. The county later cited this NDA to justify withholding documents in response to the ACLU’s public records request.
The documents also revealed that Amazon offered to connect Washington County with other Amazon government customers interested in Rekognition — as well as a body camera manufacturer. Indeed, Amazon’s promotional materials previously recommended that law enforcement use Rekognition to identify people in police body camera footage. The company removed mention of police body cameras from its site after the ACLU raised concerns in discussions with Amazon. That appears to be the extent of its response to our concerns. This and other profoundly troubling surveillance practices are still permissible under the company’s policies.
With Rekognition, a government can now build a system to automate the identification and tracking of anyone. If police body cameras, for example, were outfitted with facial recognition, devices intended for officer transparency and accountability would further transform into surveillance machines aimed at the public. With this technology, police would be able to determine who attends protests. ICE could seek to continuously monitor immigrants as they embark on new lives. Cities might routinely track their own residents, whether they have reason to suspect criminal activity or not. As with other surveillance technologies, these systems are certain to be disproportionately aimed at minority communities.
Because of Rekognition’s capacity for abuse, we asked Washington County and Orlando for any records showing that their communities had been provided an opportunity to discuss the service before its acquisition. We also asked them about rules governing how the powerful surveillance system could be used and ensuring rights would be protected. Neither locality identified such records. In fact, Washington County began using Rekognition even as employees raised questions internally. In one email, a Washington County employee expressed the concern that the “ACLU might consider this the government getting in bed with big data.” That employee’s prediction was correct.
People should be free to walk down the street without being watched by the government. By automating mass surveillance, facial recognition systems like Rekognition threaten this freedom, posing a particular threat to communities already unjustly targeted in the current political climate. Once powerful surveillance systems like these are built and deployed, the harm will be extremely difficult to undo.
If Rekognition is not reined in, its use is also certain to spread. The records we obtained show that law enforcement agencies in California and Arizona have contacted Washington County asking about Rekognition. So have multiple “fusion centers,” which collect information about people for dissemination across agencies at the local and federal level.
Amazon has publicly opposed secretive government surveillance. Its CEO, Jeff Bezos, has himself criticized Trump administration’s discriminatory Muslim ban. But actions speak louder than words, and Amazon’s efforts to deploy this technology run counter to its proclaimed values and risk harm to the company’s customers and their communities."ÿÿAmazon Teams Up With Government to Deploy Dangerous New Facial Recognition Technology

65ÿ2008-02-26ÿ10ÿDenial the right of uniformÿ1ÿPeopleÿ1ÿnegativeÿ26ÿAmazonÿ30ÿThe Guardianÿhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/26/tradeunions.workandcareersÿ"Jon Henley and Ed Pilkington: Should we be worried about 'union-avoidance' consultancies in the UK?
Like many British trades unions, the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association makes a small but regular annual contribution to the Cuba Solidarity Campaign, a reputable organisation that has campaigned for many years against the US trade blockade of Cuba and for the right of the Cuban people to national sovereignty and self-determination.
But for one firm of so-called labour relations consultants hired five years ago by Culina Logistics, a transport firm working for some of the world's leading food and drinks companies, that paltry £80 donation was reason enough, when the union attempted to organise the workforce at one of its warehouses, to stick up a poster declaring, in all seriousness: ""Your subscription bankrolls one-party communist states.""
To British eyes, the tactic may seem so crass as to be almost laughable (although it worked: the workplace voted against unionisation). But it was an early instance of what appears to be a steadily growing trend for UK companies to hire aggressive, US-style ""union busters"" to persuade their employees not to join a trade union.
The threat is serious enough for Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, and Stewart Acuff, director of organising at the TUC's American equivalent, the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations (AFL-CIO), to have announced this month that the two organisations were joining forces to ""thwart employer efforts on both sides of the Atlantic to demonise trade unions and scare employees from joining up"".
Compared to the thriving £2.3bn-a-year anti-union industry in the United States, where up to 80% of corporations faced with a union organising campaign turn to a union-busting consultancy or specialist law firm, the business is still fairly low-key in Britain. Only a handful of companies are known to have thus far availed themselves of the services of the major US firms, which bear names such as the Burke Group, Labour Relations Institute and PTI Labour Research and have shown a mounting interest in the UK market ever since the Blair government's Employment Relations Act came into effect in June 2000, guaranteeing union recognition wherever a majority of employees are in favour.
""The US firms got very excited about this,"" says John Logan of the London School of Economics, who recently completed a report on the issue for the TUC. ""Their marketing line is basically: we've got 60 years of experience in union avoidance under laws like these, and we can help you. To my knowledge, at least one US firm set up here quite soon after the act became law. It proved short-lived, but there's no doubt that several US union busters are now operating in Britain, and their activities are increasing, particularly in workplaces with no prior union recognition whatsoever.""
Both the consultancies and the companies that hire them generally want the involvement of the union busters kept secret. In almost every recorded case of union busting in Britain, the union involved was completely oblivious to the fact that an outside consultancy was involved. The very up-front Burke Group (TBG) of Malibu, California, whose website proudly advertises its expertise in ""union avoidance consulting, counter-union campaigns, supervisory training, union vulnerability assessments, card signing mitigation, anti-corporate campaigns and more"", was reportedly active in eight UK companies between 2001 and 2003, and no one was any the wiser until after the recognition campaign was over.
Companies such as Amazon.co.uk, Honeywell, Calor Gas, T-Mobile and Virgin Atlantic have all made use of TBG's services, according to Logan's study, which cites data obtained from the consultancy's website before it was password-protected. Amicus union officials at another company, GE Caledonian, said they were ""blown out of the water"" when workers there unexpectedly rejected the union. More recently, the consultancy carried the day at Kettle Chips in Norwich. The workforce at the company, which is owned by the private equity company Lion Capital, includes many immigrants and last year voted by 206 to 93 not to join Britain's biggest union, Unite. (The company insists it has ""never been opposed to employees joining Unite or any union of their choice"", adding that its employees enjoy a secure salary at least 25% above the minimum wage, a 38-hour week, 25 days' paid holiday a year, 100% sick pay and a non-contributory pension scheme.)
Union busters rarely show their faces on the shop floor, preferring to work through selected company supervisors, who in turn use mailshots, one-on-one meetings with employees, forced-attendance group meetings, anti-union leaflets and videos and, in some cases, discrimination against union organisers and even sackings to get their message across. ""The basic message is that unions are poison,"" says Logan.
""Employees will be repeatedly told that the arrival of a union will inevitably result in conflict, confrontation and strike action, with a consequent loss of earnings, and that collective bargaining can in any case often lead to lower pay. Unions are said to be interested only in raking in members' dues so that a small number of fat-cat union bosses can live the high life. Other common arguments are that unionisation is futile, and could well lead to the company losing competitiveness - and so, perhaps, to a decision to relocate, at the cost of jobs. And there's a lot of extreme anti-union rhetoric, particularly in the States, with employers constantly being told they are 'at war' and 'under attack' from trades unions.""
Stewart Acuff of the AFL-CIO has watched with horror as techniques originally pioneered in the south of the United States have begun to proliferate in Europe and around the globe. ""It's become an American export - the most shameful American export,"" he says. ""We talk about freedom all the time in this country, and yet our workers are deprived the most basic freedom - the freedom to organise themselves.""
Union busting took off as a feature of the American business landscape in the late 70s and early 80s, according to Acuff. Under US labour law, any group of workers is entitled to hold an election to form a union if at least a third of the workers is interested in so doing. The first thing an employer will do when they hear that such an election is pending is pick up the phone to one of the union-busting consultancies, paying, in the case of larger firms, hundreds of thousands of dollars for the privilege.
Labour Relations Institute is typical of one of the larger firms. It does not call itself a union buster, preferring the phrase ""union avoidance consultancy"". LRI is 25 years old and in that time reckons to have helped shoot down more than 5,000 elections to allow workers to organise. How does it do it? The company says it deploys a ""nearly unbeatable combination"" of media to nudge workers into the no camp. ""Our goal is not only to help you turn back the union, but to be sure you do so legally and permanently,"" it says.
It publishes a book called Total Victory! - 478 pages of advice to union breakers gleaned from ""thousands of victorious management campaigns"". It produces a stack of campaign literature every bit as professional as the literature pouring out of the Barack Obama for President campaign. When LRI is put on to a union election, it will ply workers with bumper stickers with a huge red tick to the no box, lollipops on a stick printed with the refrain ""Unions suck"", bags of ""Union free"" popcorn, and sponges that say ""Don't get soaked for union dues - vote no!""
There are also videos with a long and lurid history of evil union ways, and cartoon postcards showing a drawing of a big fat cat, a lighted cigar in its mouth and its paw pointing directly out at you. ""This is your union,"" reads the caption.
None of this appears to be particularly sophisticated. But then none of it needs to be, says Mary Beth Maxwell, head of the charity American Rights at Work. ""It doesn't take much to intimidate people and make them afraid. If the guy who signs your pay cheque or allows you sick cover for your kids is breathing down your neck, then it's not that difficult.""
LRI charges $375 (£190) an hour for the ""outreach work"" of its consultants. The service it is most proud of is the ""guaranteed winner package"" - you don't win, you don't pay. In other words, if the election goes ahead and workers vote to approve a union, then the entire cost of the ""union avoidance campaign"" is refunded to the employer. But that rarely, if ever happens. In the past two years, LRI has not lost a single vote.
Tim Hunt is one of LRI's 60 consultants. Like the firm he works for, he prefers to avoid the term union buster, referring to himself as a case manager, consultant, or with the rather Orwellian word ""persuader"". When asked to explain how LRI manages to be so successful in squashing moves to unionise groups of workers, he says it is a process of ""education"" in which consultants present the ""true facts"" about how unions operate. ""The bottom line is that unions are after people's union dues. When we tell people the truth about the unions, and what they are after, they quickly come round.""
Hunt describes some of the tools that consultants have at their disposal. They have a huge news clippings service which allows them to give workers handouts of newspaper articles focusing on strikes called by the particular union involved or cases of corruption within that union. LRI consultants then pass around what they call ""strike computers"" - paper calculators that allow a worker to assess how much money they would lose from their monthly pay packet should they be called out to strike.
Tactfully, because it is illegal to poll workers to find out which way they are leaning, the consultants will then begin to analyse individual employees, secretly classifying them with a number from 1 to denote pro-union to 5 to denote resistant to unionisation. That will be used as the basis, Hunt says, for compulsory workplace meetings with managers with each numerical group gathering separately so that workers can be subjected to differing methods of persuasion according to their proclivities.
""If a worker tells one of these meetings, 'I wish we had more vacation time', or, 'I wish our pay and conditions were better', then we reply: 'Great! We can negotiate that!'"" Hunt chuckles, then adds: ""We never say 'will'. It's always, 'We can negotiate that,"" never 'We will ...'""
Hunt's explication of the union-busting technique chimes with academic surveys that have catalogued some of the more commonly used methods. Research by Cornell University shows that in 75% of elections to bring a union into a workplace, workers are subjected to one-on-one sessions with their bosses before the vote is held. In half of the elections, the company threatens to move if workers vote yes.
Strictly speaking, it is illegal under employment law to threaten to relocate, but there is no penalty for employers who do so. Similarly, it is illegal to sack any of the leaders of a union election, but in one in four votes sackings do ensue - equivalent to about 20,000 dismissals a year.
""At the end of the day, it's just intimidation,"" says Acuff. ""The intellectual arguments used by these consultants are easily refutable and practically irrelevant. What works is the intimidation - the threat that you are going to lose your job, or car or house.""
Hunt can see that in some of the more extreme cases, particularly of abusive employer practices in the south of the United States, a union may be helpful to workers. He knows as much from personal experience because, paradoxically, before he became a union buster, he worked as a union representative and treasurer in Oklahoma for 11 years. He remembers once coming into contact with workers in a steel plant in the south. ""They were treated astonishingly badly. The management had the people so terrified they feared for their lives, and for their families' lives.""
Only once, though, has he distanced himself from a job with LRI. It was a textile plant in the Carolinas that was paying extremely low wages and where workers were, in effect, being abused. ""I could see the need for a union there to bring in fairer treatment,"" he says. But Hunt insists he doesn't suffer sleepless nights about his betrayal of the union cause. ""For the most part I know what I am doing is best for people and their families. Employers offer better working conditions and wages than unions offer,"" he says.
Not true, refutes Acuff. His figures suggest that unionised workers earn on average 30% more than their non-unionised brothers and sisters. About 57 million American workers would like to join a union, partly for this reason, but the activities of LRI and other consultancies like it are making this a losing battle.
Each year, more union members are lost through branches closing or job losses than are newly recruited. The total proportion of unionised labour in the workforce is now barely 12.5%, and just 7.5% in the private sector. ""An American worker now makes less than he or she did in 1973, adjusted for inflation,"" Acuff notes.
In Britain, 18-19% of private-sector workers are unionised, while the total in the workforce as a whole stands at around 30%. Logan believes there is a ""definite possibility"" that a US-style union-busting industry will establish itself firmly here - particularly if British unions make a sustained effort to organise overwhelmingly non-unionised service sectors industries such as the hospitality trade.
A number of factors, though, suggest that the union busters may not have quite such an easy ride here as they have enjoyed in the US, he believes. ""To start with, penalties for violations of the UK employment laws are a great deal stiffer than in America. Also, in Britain unions can claim recognition if 50% of the workforce have signed union membership cards, whereas in the States you always have to go through this long, drawn-out workplace voting procedure, which gives the consultancies all the time and scope they need to interfere and manipulate. So the environment may not be quite so propitious.""
There is a feeling, too, that for the time being at least, the weight of public opinion in Britain is still set quite firmly against what are still considered devious and underhand methods. In the wake of overwhelmingly negative press coverage of the Kettle Chips campaign, for example, the company feltobliged to hire Hill & Knowlton, a leading PR firm, to improve its image. In the often ferociously anti-union culture that prevails in US management circles, few American companies would ever feel the need to do that. But anti-union activity in this country is almost certainly more widespread than unions realise, Logan believes. ""The evidence suggests that British employers are not as tolerant of union activity as people think,"" he says. ""If more British unions attempt to organise in non-union sectors, we will almost certainly see a parallel increase in union-busting activity in Britain. The risk is there."""ÿÿJon Henley and Ed Pilkington: Should we be worried about 'union-avoidance' consultancies in the UK?

WORKERS LAID off this week by the online retailing giant Amazon.com believe they were not just victims of economic hard times but targets of a concerted effort by the company to crush a burgeoning unionisation drive, the first of its kind in the internet economy.
Union organisers have appealed to the federal government for an immediate investigation into the lay-offs, saying the largest group of the hundreds facing the sack were in a Seattle customer service centre where union activity has been most intense,
The organisers have accused the company of violating union laws. Backed by a group called the Washington Alliance of Technological Workers, they say Amazon managers subjected them to intimidation and heavy propaganda once the union's recruitment drive began in November.
""The deepest cuts are being made in the one place where there is union organising,"" said Marcus Courtney, a co-founder of WashTech. ""That has to raise red flags."" Of the 1,300 job losses - 15 per cent of the company workforce - 850 will come from cuts in Seattle, Amazon's home city, and the rest from closing a distribution centre in Georgia.
The Amazon recruitment drive has been the first substantial union organisation in America's digital economy. Yet nobody would claim the threat of collective bargaining was the only headache afflicting Amazon's top brass. The company has never made a profit on its heavily discounted books, CDs and other merchandise, and its share price has been in freefall for 10 months.
But the turmoil gives the lie to the notion that the dot.com world is a groovier, friendlier, more lifestyle-enhancing place to work than the standard hamster-wheel of Old Economy capitalism. A year ago, Amazon's chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, was named Time magazine's Man of the Year, largely on the strength of his ability to combine entrepre-neurial prowess with the image of a Mr Nice Guy who cared about his staff.
Then last January, 150 employees in Seattle were given an hour to pack and escorted off the premises. The company was having to rethink its strategy of growth without profitability and cut costs so increased sales did not simply translate into bigger losses.
Part of the company's customer service operation has moved to Delhi, where workers paid a fraction of their Seattle counterparts answer e-mail queries from US customers. Other divisions have opened in North Dakota and West Virginia, where employees earn considerably lower salaries and benefits than their high-class, high-maintenance, caffe latte-quaffing colleagues in the Pacific North-west.
This is the sort of corporate behaviour that brought 50,000 people on to the streets of Seattle during the 1999 World Trade Organisation summit, putting profits before people, as the street slogan had it. Both sides have taken the point to heart.
Union organisers have made job stability their main priority, and the management, mindful of the negative publicity triggered by even an appearance of corporate ruthlessness, has spent much of the past year tempering its more radical decisions with eye-catching PR manoeuvres. But shortly after union recruitment literature began circulating, Amazon's management put together talking points for supervisors to use with staff and called meetings to discuss the downsides of unionisation.
""Inform reps of the disadvantages of joining a union, including the possibility of strikes, serving on picket line, fines and dues,"" read one e-mail from an executive, Laurie Arnold, to Amazon supervisors. The company even held an ""all-hands"" meeting, which everyone, even those with the day off, was urged to attend for a lecture on the evils of unions without a balancing argument for the other side.
Mostly it was a charm offensive, rather than an exercise in overt threats. The warning was clear - think twice before organising. Amazon asked its customer service staff, the very people involved, to send out a standard response to inquiries on the issue. ""While unions do have a role in society,"" the response read, ""at Amazon.com, everyone is an owner and can exercise individual rights to raise any workplace issues or concerns at any time.""
In December, four union activists who had set up a booth in the company cafeteria were told they were violating the company's non- solicitation policy and had to leave. WashTech asked why the unionists were kicked out when other booths advertising cultural events were allowed to stay, but never had a response.
Rumours of job cuts began to circulate. When the announcement came this week, alongside Amazon's fourth-quarter results, the cuts hit without apparent regard for experience or length of service. Amazon denies any link between the unionisation effort and the lay-offs, although it acknowledges high labour costs in Seattle have been a factor. The company cites the relatively soft landing it has provided for laid-off employees, including participation in a special $2.5m (pounds 1.7m) stock option trust fund maturing in 2003."ÿÿShort shrift for unions in Amazon's silicon jungle

Yikes. That's really all there is to say, at first, about the FACE, or Former and Current Employees, of Amazon.
The site appears to have popped up in the aftermath of the expose of Amazon's live-fast-die-hard culture run last August by the New York Times. On it, hundreds of ""former and current"" employees of the ecommerce giant tell their own stories about toxic workplaces, management abuse, discrimination, and a whole litany of other cultural ills.
A caveat: there is a possibility that these are all fake, cooked up by a bored teenager or even a competing company (The site's hosted on Google Sites! Gasp!). It's very unusual, however, for an entire site to be created solely to document the abuses present among management at one company. We're going to proceed as though these are legitimate stories about Amazon past & present.
Since there are a ton of these stories, I went through and picked out the ten big lessons that you should take away from what the FACE of Amazon are saying. Make sure you're not doing these things, or it could be your FACE on the internet next.
1. Don't Just Claim Equal Opportunity--Offer It
It's been proven that teams with more women are smarter. Amazon, which in many stories appears to be a place where amazing things are accomplished when those with high IQs yell at each other, would do well to take note of that fact.
""As a woman and as a new mother,"" one user wrote, ""I can say [Amazon] was the worst place I've ever worked. I missed vacations, weddings, and any quality time with my new son just so that my boss wouldn't rate me badly on my performance.""
Other users recount stories of being fired on the spot for reporting sexual harassment or pregnancy.
""In summary, Amazon is a wonderful place to work if you are apathetic, white, male and have no ethics or morals,"" one user wrote, ""For the rest of us with proper career growth aspirations, it is a very sexist and racist environment and they do not respect their employees.""
2. Hire And Train Your Managers For Consistency
At the root of many FACE complaints is a phenomenon that won't be unfamiliar for anyone with experience at a big company: different teams with different managers can be very different experiences.
""Some [teams] are run with compassion,"" one user wrote, ""Others with fear.""
""I think the problem with the bad ones is that it is assumed that if you think [a team] is terrible then you must be the problem,"" they added.
If an employee comes to you with a complaint about their manager, take it seriously. If you assume that the employee is lying and punish them further, you're only saving yourself time and face. If you take the time to check out the complaint and it turns out to have merit, then you're not just saving that one employee's future. You're saving a whole team from being ravaged and burned out by a terrible manager.
3. Be Very Careful With Anonymous Feedback
Another common object of derision on the FACE group is the way that Amazonians were encouraged to give feedback. Under a program called Anytime Feedback, anyone at Amazon was allowed to give anonymous feedback on any other employee, at any time, on any topic.
""Do you want to anonymously get your coworkers in trouble? Amazon's behind you,"" one user wrote, ""Just remember, others will be doing the same to you, especially blowing up any small missteps you make.""
Even if you decided that the most vicious 10% of the stories on FACE were exaggerated, there's plenty ""in between the lines"" that is stunning to read from an outsider's perspective, like this piece of advice for prospective employees:
""[Y]ou have to be careful about screwing over your teammates,"" one manager wrote, ""You are going to need allies to do well in the performance management process. You need to at least look like a team player, but maximize to your own advantage.""
Except in cases where there's something seriously illegal going on and there are fears of retaliation, anonymous feedback isn't helpful. You can't help someone who gives you anonymous feedback. You can't know that it's serious, because there's no accountability. So be very careful if you decide to go down this route.
4. Don't Take Broomball Too Seriously
Entrepreneurs are a competitive bunch, and so games often make up the entertainment on breaks and at team events. It's super satisfying to get on the field with your team and playing a game of friendly soccer or pick-up basketball to unwind after a long day.
There's a story on the FACE group about a game called Broomball that shows the lengths to which games can go wrong, however.
""[Jeff] would keep people at Amazon who weren't good at their jobs if they would be able to help him win the broomball tournament,"" one user wrote, ""Similarly, he would give the members of any team that beat him a hard time about it and sometimes that would hurt their careers if their managers took those comments too seriously, since they came from Jeff.""
Keep it loose, and leave your ego at the office. Seriously. You have team events not to fulfill your own ambition and drive to win, but to promote friendship and build up your team's culture.
Don't You Know That You're Toxic
As usual, Brittany Spears said it best: ""Oh, / The taste of your lips / I'm on a ride / You're toxic, I'm slipping under.""
When you allow toxicity to seep into your culture and combine it with organized autonomous teams like the ones Jeff Bezos is famous for pioneering, it's very easy to end up with a cultural death spiral. A good company culture starts with good fundamentals. Treat people well. Have an inherent aversion to politics. Practice equality.
Then don't hire people who don't meet those standards, and definitely don't go around throwing promotions at them.

The next time you feel your boss is driving you like a heartless task master, you might want to ponder the alleged plight of some poor lads in England.
Temporary workers at Amazon.com's U.K. fulfillment centers risk being terminated if they call in sick and are required to work seven days a week, according to a report published Sunday in The Times of London. Employees reportedly get only two short breaks for an eight-hour shift and must request permission to use the toilet. The temporary employees hired to handle the seasonal increase in business earn the equivalent of $10.40 an hour but must pay $13 a day to take a bus to the warehouse if they can't arrange their own transportation, the newspaper reported.
Employees are also penalized for not achieving what one manager called ""ridiculous"" packing quotas and are often required to walk up to 14 miles during the course of a shift to retrieve items for shipping, according to a Times reporter who went undercover at Amazon's Bedfordshire warehouse.
Amazon does not deny the report. llan Lyall, vice president of European operations for Amazon, responded to the report in a statement printed with the story:
Every single member of the Amazon.co.uk workforce... is currently working flat out to ensure that our millions of customers receive the products that they have ordered on time this Christmas. Our number one focus is our customers and everyone at Amazon works hard on their behalf.
Apparently, it's also well known that being a holiday temp is the only way to get a full-time job with the company and that competition is fierce.
Demand for permanent roles from our temporary employees is at such a high level that we no longer need to recruit externally for permanent positions. Indeed, we have already seen well over 100 temporary employees become permanent this year alone. During 2008, we have taken on over 4,000 temporary fulfillment center associates in the U.K. and are benefiting from the lowest level of employees leaving the company that we have experienced over all our 11 Christmases.
Representatives for the company in the U.S. did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but spokeswoman Patty Smith told the Seattle Press Intelligencer that there were ""inaccuracies"" in The Times report.
""Don't believe everything you read!"" Smith said via e-mail. ""There were many inaccuracies in the U.K. article. Case in point: We don't allow FC (fulfillment center) associates to work more than 6 days a week in any location--they must have at least one day off."""ÿÿAmazon U.K. accused of sweatshop conditions

Amazon has been accused of creating “intolerable working conditions” after allegations that workers have been penalised for sick days and that some are camping near one of its warehouses to save money commuting to work.
Willie Rennie, the Liberal Democrat leader in Scotland, said Amazon should be “ashamed” that workers at its warehouse in Dunfermline have chosen to camp outside in the winter.
He made the comments after the the Courier newspaper published photographs of tents near the site that it said were being lived in by Amazon workers. It said at least three tents were pitched close to the warehouse by the M90 in Dunfermline and that a man living in one of them had said he was an employee who usually lives in Perth.
A Sunday Times investigation found that temporary workers at the warehouse were being penalised for taking time off sick and put under pressure to hit targets for picking orders. It also claimed that although workers could walk up to 10 miles a day doing their jobs, water dispensers were regularly empty.
Amazon has hired 20,000 agency workers for the peak Christmas season, more than doubling its workforce. Staff have to pay to catch an agency-provided bus to the Dunfermline site.
Rennie has repeatedly called for the firm to improve conditions at its Dunfermline site and said the latest claim “chimes with the feedback I have received from local people over a long period of time”.
He said: “It confirms that Amazon have created intolerable working conditions for many. The company don’t seem to be interested in keeping workers for too long as they work them until they drop. They have generated an oppressive culture where management and some workers put undue pressure on workers.
“It’s time for Amazon to finally change their ways. That means a change to wages and to working conditions.”
Rennie said the firm should be “ashamed that they pay their workers so little that they have to camp out in the dead of winter to make ends meet”.
Amazon, which has 12 fulfilment centres around the UK, has come under fire in the past for its treatment of workers, many of whom are employed through agencies. Three years ago, an undercover reporter for the Observer wrote about the long hours and physical work carried out for low pay, while more recently unions have claimed that workers are falling ill as a result.
Online job forums have reviews by former workers which describe being expected to “work like robots” and “paranoia with job security”. Workers say overtime is compulsory and holidays banned in the busy months of November and December.
When questioned about the tents, Amazon said it “provides a safe and positive workplace with competitive pay and benefits from day one”.
It added: “We are proud to have been able to create several thousand new permanent roles in our UK fulfilment centres over the last five years. One of the reasons we’ve been able to attract so many people to join us is that we offer great jobs and a positive work environment with opportunities for growth.
“We offer associates a range of roles in our fulfilment centres, depending on their preferences. Some roles involve walking a number of miles each day, a fact we make clear during the recruitment process. Many associates seek these positions as they enjoy the active nature of the work. There are many opportunities for people who prefer less active roles.
“As with nearly all companies, we expect a certain level of performance from our associates. Productivity targets are set objectively, based on previous performance levels achieved by our workforce.”
The company said it analysed wages every year to ensure they were competitive. All permanent and temporary Amazon workers start on £7.35 an hour or more and earn at least £11 an hour for overtime. There are paid 30-minute lunch breaks and subsidised meals. The new national living wage is £7.20 for workers aged over 25.
Water is readily available for staff as they performed their duties, Amazon said, and it has a “fair and predictable system to record staff attendance and take into account individual circumstances”.
Michael Newman, an employment lawyer at Leigh Day, said that it was legal for companies to have a policy which meant that workers were effectively penalised if they were off sick. “Absence policies are definitely becoming stricter – one example would be having a bonus or ‘attendance allowance’ that is then forfeited if the worker is off sick,” he said.
“Amazon’s policy doesn’t seem particularly unusual though – the important thing is to distinguish between days off, and periods of absence. It is usually the latter that counts for unfair dismissal purposes, although many policies look at both how long you are off for, and how many times you are off.”
The Labour MP Frank Field, who has been campaigning against poor conditions for self-employed workers, said the government-ordered review into working practices should issue an interim report.
“Inquiries take time but over that time the injustices are growing,” he said. “There have been reports on Hermes and Uber done by my office, and now the Sunday Times investigation – there is enough information out there.”"ÿÿAmazon accused of 'intolerable conditions' at Scottish warehouse | Amazon

Amazon has a delivery depot in Avonmouth, in Bristol
Amazon delivery drivers regularly work ""illegal"" hours and receive less than the minimum wage, it has been claimed.
Drivers for agencies contracted by the internet giant told an undercover reporter they were expected to deliver up to 200 parcels a day.
Some admitted breaking speed limits to stay on schedule, while others said time was not allowed for toilet breaks.
Amazon said it was committed to ensuring drivers drive safely and legally, and are ""fairly compensated"".
The retailer could face questions in parliament over the working conditions at the company.

England's oddest phrases explained
A BBC reporter got a job with AHC services, one of many agencies which supplies drivers to the firm's delivery wing Amazon Logistics in the south of England, and which the BBC had heard a lot of complaints about.
'Defecate in bags'
During a two-week stint with AHC at Amazon's Avonmouth depot in Bristol, he said he:
* Received a fixed rate of £110 per route, or set of deliveries, completed each day, * Worked more than 11 hours a day - delivery drivers are breaking the law if they exceed this limit, * Was told by an agency supervisor he ""didn't have to worry about a seatbelt"" because ""the police won't stop"" a delivery driver, * Had colleagues tell him they had to ""defecate in bags"" and ""urinate in bottles"" because there was no time for toilet breaks, * Was paid £93.47 for three days' work in his first week, after deductions including optional van hire for a week and insurance - equal to £2.59 per hour, * Received the equivalent of £4.76 per hour in his second week when he worked four days,
Several drivers told him they were paid the equivalent of an hourly rate below the national minimum wage of £7.20, mainly due to working long hours to deliver all the parcels they were assigned.
A day in the life of an Amazon driver
Some agency staff complained the system does not allow for traffic jams and does not factor in time for breaks, he said.
Former driver, Charlie Chikaviro, said the pressure to deliver parcels left him with no choice but to drive quickly.
""I had to, the way it was designed. You're going to have to do that,"" he said.
""I had a few crashes... but not bad crashes.""
Former supervisor for AHC Cody Cooper said she ordered one driver to stop driving because he fell asleep at the wheel
Cody Cooper, a former supervisor who left AHC services a year ago, said she ordered one driver, who fell asleep at the wheel, to stop driving because she feared he could ""end up killing someone"".
""It was coming up to school time and there could [have been] a group of schoolchildren walking along... and he could have steered off,"" she said.
""I wasn't willing to live with that.""
Amazon Logistics requires agency drivers to be self-employed, and therefore not entitled to the minimum wage or employment rights like sick pay or holiday pay.
The undercover reporter was paid the equivalent of £2.60 per hour for one week's work
Tonia Novitz, professor of labour law at Bristol University, said in her opinion drivers contracted by AHC should not be classed as self-employed, because they do not determine their own routes, days of work or rest periods.
""From the evidence I've seen, which suggests [the undercover reporter] would be regarded as a worker or agency worker, he should be getting the national minimum wage,"" she said.
In a statement Amazon said: ""As independent contractors of our delivery providers, drivers deliver at their own pace, take breaks at their discretion, and are able to choose the suggestion route or develop their own.""
The company said it expected drivers to be paid a minimum of £12 per hour ""before bonuses, incentives and fuel reimbursements"", and it required independent delivery providers to ensure drivers were fully licensed and insured and obeyed ""all applicable traffic and safety laws"".
In the past six months, drivers drove a daily average of 8.5 hours and were on duty for 9.1 hours, it added.
Oxford-based AHC dismissed claims put to them by the BBC as ""historic and based on isolated examples which occurred over a year ago"" and said: ""Since then we have made changes to the way our checks are carried out and taken a number of steps to improve our ways of working.""
The firm said it took road safety and the welfare of its contracted drivers ""extremely seriously"", and that drivers were free to choose when they worked.
Iain Wright, the Labour MP and chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, told the BBC: ""These are serious allegations that call into question a lot of business practises carried out by Amazon.
""There are rising challenges in respect of what's happening with online retail and ever growing customer demand.
""It's a balance - it's making sure that the customer gets what he or she wants, at a time that is suitable for them. But it shouldn't be done on the back of exploitation of workers.""

Drivers for Amazon are apparently urinating in bottles as they struggle to deliver 200 parcels a day.
According to The Sunday Mirror, many work 12-hour long shifts, despite UK law prohibiting drivers from working over 11 hours per day.

Some even claim they have to break speed limits to meet their daily targets.
Amazon does not hire its own drivers, but uses an agency to recruit teams of workers on ‘self-employed’ contracts.
It is claimed the contracts are used to avoid giving drivers holiday or sick pay.
Whistleblower drivers from Prospect Commercial Ltd made the claims about their working conditions at Amazon’s depot in Sheffield.
After paying for van hire and insurance, some of the drivers claim they are earning less than the national minimum wage.

And they also said the little time they have to deliver each parcel is forcing them to stop taking toilets breaks.
Which means some of them are urinating in plastic bottles in their vans, it was claimed.
A solicitor said the working conditions are ‘horrendous’.
Steven Eckett, head of employment at solicitors Meaby and Co, told the Sunday Mirror: ‘These workers deliver Amazon packages, collected from an Amazon depot and are given a route designed by Amazon. They are Amazon workers in all but name.
‘But Amazon are trying to distance themselves from the workers to circumvent employment law. This needs to be challenged.’

Zachariah Vargas was six hours into his shift delivering packages for Amazon.
He was about to drop off a package when he accidentally slammed the door of his truck on his hand. The door clicked shut, trapping his middle and ring fingers.
Once he freed his fingers, the blood began to pour. Both of Vargas' arms started to shake involuntarily. The lacerations were deep. Vargas thought he glimpsed bone when he wiped away the blood.
Panicked, Vargas called his dispatch supervisor, who was working at a nearby Amazon facility.
He said he received no sympathy.
""The first thing they asked was, 'How many packages do you have left?'"" he told Business Insider.
Vargas had dozens remaining. Delivering them all would take several hours. Still, his supervisor advised him to drop them all off before returning to the station or seeking care.
Vargas ignored his boss and headed back. He was worried, and there was no first-aid kit in the truck.
When he arrived at the station he said he was mocked.
""My dispatcher kept saying, 'Are you dying right now? Girls have come back with worse wounds than you,'"" Vargas said.
The same manager ordered Vargas to unload his truck and pointed toward an Amazon official at the warehouse and told him: ""Amazon is watching you. They don't like when undelivered packages come back.""
Vargas also claims another supervisor told him he should have knocked on a customer's door to ask for a Band-Aid, then continued on his route.
The supervisors told him to go to the hospital to prove he was injured, even though he did not have health insurance at the time, Vargas said.
""At that moment I realized, 'I don't know if I want to continue working for this company if they don't even care what happens to me,'"" he added. ""It was a wake-up call.""
Vargas' experience may be extreme. But he isn't the only driver delivering packages for Amazon who has found the job alarmingly tough.
With Amazon's rapid growth, the environment for drivers is getting only more demanding.
Amazon has more than 100 million paying Prime members. The membership, which costs $119 annually, promises free two-day shipping on millions of items and same-day delivery through Prime Now.
The company delivered over 5 billion Prime packages worldwide in 2017. To ensure that millions of packages are delivered each day, Amazon employs some drivers through its Amazon Flex program. The Flex drivers work directly with Amazon. They make their own hours and are their own bosses.
Amazon also uses FedEx, UPS, and USPS, as well as third-party courier companies that it calls delivery service partners, or DSPs, which manage their own fleets.
Delivery service partners are companies that employ and manage many drivers, like Vargas, who work to fulfill deliveries for partners such as Amazon. Vargas did not wish to name his employer.
For Amazon, paying third-party companies to deliver packages is a cost-effective alternative to providing full employment. And the speed of two-day shipping is great for consumers. But delivering that many packages isn't easy, and the job is riddled with problems, according to interviews with 31 current or recently employed Amazon-affiliated delivery workers with experience across 14 third-party companies spanning 13 cities.
In interviews over the course of eight months, drivers described a variety of alleged abuses, including lack of overtime pay, missing wages, intimidation, and favoritism. Drivers also described a physically demanding work environment in which, under strict time constraints, they felt pressured to drive at dangerously high speeds, blow stop signs, and skip meal and bathroom breaks.
Many of their accounts were supported by text messages, photographs, internal emails, legal filings, and peers.
In response to this story, Amazon said that some challenges exist within its wide network of delivery providers and that it's working to improve the system.
""While it is impossible to characterize a network of thousands of delivery drivers based on anecdotes, we do recognize small businesses sometimes need more support when scaling fast,"" Amazon spokeswoman Amanda Ip said in a statement to Business Insider. ""We have worked with our partners, listened to their needs, and have implemented new programs to ensure small delivery businesses serving Amazon customers have the tools they need to deliver a great customer and employee experience.""
Some drivers said they felt Amazon-affiliated courier companies were to blame for many of the problems they described.
Others, including several labor experts, said they felt blame should be placed with Amazon, adding that the company was pressuring courier companies to deliver more, faster. They said Amazon was profiting off cheap labor that it doesn't have to protect because it's outsourcing the job to companies that it doesn't adequately supervise.
""Amazon is doing whatever they want,"" Edgar Cerda, a driver who's worked for two courier companies delivering packages for Amazon, told Business Insider. ""And we're paying the price.""
It doesn't take much to become an applicant for Amazon's courier business
Amazon drivers arrive for work at a delivery station in Richmond, Virginia.
Hayley Peterson/Business Insider
Amazon solicits prospective courier companies through an online application process. It doesn't take much more than cargo vans and insurance to apply.
""Start your business with as little as $10,000,"" Amazon advertises on its website. ""Logistics experience not required.""
The whole process to become a courier for Amazon can take as little as four weeks or as long as six months.
Once Amazon accepts a courier into its system, it provides a set number of daily delivery routes. Each route, which is assigned to a single driver, has a daily volume of between 250 and 300 packages, on average. Drivers said that number could spike as high as 400 during peak holiday periods.
Amazon also provides the electronic devices — referred to internally as ""rabbits"" — that drivers use for scanning each package and route navigation.
Courier companies then handle the costs of running the business, including payroll, taxes, insurance, vans, and gas.
In a recent push to add more couriers to its delivery network, Amazon started offering incentives, such as special rates on vans and employee insurance programs, to anyone willing to start a delivery business. The company announced last week that it was ordering 20,000 Mercedes-Benz vans for the new incentive program.
""Our recently launched Delivery Service Partner program offers a number of new features including customized branded vehicles for delivery, preventative vehicle maintenance services, low-cost vehicle and employee insurance plans, and a payroll system customized for their business,"" Amazon said. ""We are simultaneously recruiting new businesses into this program and transitioning our existing delivery partners into this new program.""
Business Insider
Amazon's courier companies operate out of delivery stations, which are typically located near Amazon fulfillment and sortation facilities, and often handle about 30 delivery routes a day at each location.
Some courier companies are small and operate out of a single region. others have hundreds of employees working out of multiple delivery stations across the US.
Amazon said many drivers who deliver packages for the company are paid competitively and have access to comprehensive benefits.
""Hundreds of delivery associates are working full-time jobs that offer competitive pay and comprehensive benefits through their delivery service provider,"" Amazon's Ip said.
Courier companies pay drivers either a flat rate of between $125 and $150 a day or an hourly rate of between $13 and $15 an hour, according to drivers.
That rate is roughly in line with other delivery service jobs. The median hourly wage for delivery service drivers is $15.12, or $31,450 annually, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Jim Blanchard, a representative for Courier Distribution Systems and DeliverOL, said that jobs delivering packages for Amazon are pulling poor Americans out of extreme poverty and enabling them to buy houses and cars.
""We're taking unskilled labor that is traditionally earning an income that puts them far below the poverty line,"" he told Business Insider. ""This is truly how to bridge the gap between no shot and that next level of life.""
Jermaine Lakota Johnson, a former driver for Courier Distribution Systems, in Everett, Massachusetts, said he was paid about $740 a week, or about $38,000 annually before taxes.
""It was a great job, one of my favorites actually,"" Johnson said of his Amazon delivery days.
In addition to the decent pay, he said he had flexible hours and could take as many breaks as he needed. If he finished his deliveries by 2 p.m., he'd have the rest of the day off.
Other drivers agreed that the pay they were promised was enticing. But many found their employers failed to follow through on their promises.
Allegations of broken promises, intimidation, and retaliation
A driver delivering Amazon packages. (The drivers in this story are not employed by Penske).
Several people described instances when they felt their bosses at Amazon-affiliated courier companies took advantage of them.
Four drivers across three companies said their employers misrepresented the job by promising health benefits without following through. One worker said that when he started his job, his employer promised that he would get health benefits within 90 days of employment. He said he was fired within days of qualifying.
Eight workers across four companies said drivers were denied overtime pay, despite working well over 40 hours a week. Thirteen workers across five companies complained about wages missing from paychecks.
""The culture is predatory,"" said Ku Irvin, who started working as a driver for DeliverOL, in Aurora, Colorado, in November 2016. ""It's a revolving door. A lot of promises are made that are not kept.""
Nine months later, Irvin became a manager but said he couldn't stomach it. ""Once I got behind the desk, I saw what was going on and it was sickening to me,"" he said.
A few drivers told Business Insider that they felt powerless to address problems because they feared retaliation.
They described the measures they feared as firings, withholding of wages, and denial of work — meaning drivers could be sent home without a delivery route on days they were scheduled.
""If I didn't come in on my day off, they threatened to fire me,"" Justin Waring, a former driver for Courier Distribution Systems, in Lisle, Illinois, told Business Insider.
A supervisor at a New Jersey-based logistics company, Prime EFS, sent a threatening text to drivers in late April:
""Tomorrow is Saturday. The Weekend. Where everyone wants to call out,"" read the message, which was viewed by Business Insider. ""You're scheduled for tomorrow so I expect everyone confirmed and on time tomorrow. Any callouts I will make sure you do not receive a route for a week."" Prime EFS did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.
One Richmond, Virginia-based driver at another Amazon-affiliated courier company claimed he was sent home on a scheduled workday as punishment for arriving one minute late.
""That's their way of disciplining you,"" said the driver, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of getting fired.
Christian Loera, who worked for Courier Distribution Systems, in Lisle, Illinois, for two years, said that when he asked to cut back on his number of workdays because of scheduling conflicts, his supervisors then gave him the heaviest routes with the highest number of packages.
""They would give me the hardest, longest routes they could,"" Loera said.
He also alleged that, later on, one of his managers offered him a schedule with Saturdays and Sundays off if he paid the manager $500 to $600 in cash.
Loera said he turned down the offer. He said he was later fired. He believes it was because he did not comply with a request to report to work on his day off.
Drivers interviewed by Business Insider said they typically deliver between 250 and 300 packages daily, though volumes can sometimes spike as high as 400 packages.
Loera left the company in May 2017 and sent an email, which was viewed by Business Insider, to the company's human resources department detailing some of the problems he said he encountered on the job. His manager has since parted ways with the company.
""We had issues in regards to [the manager's] leadership and we did not support some of the things he was doing,"" Blanchard, the representative of Courier Distribution Systems and DeliverOL, said. Further details on the matter were unavailable and an investigation was still ongoing, he said.
Eight drivers across five companies accused their managers of favoritism.
""If they like you, you'll get lucky. If they don't, they will make your life miserable,"" Hector Rivera, a former driver for New York-based courier company Thruway Direct, said. ""In the end, they know people need jobs. So if you don't like it and you leave, they will just replace you with someone else.""
Thruway Direct did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story. A person reached by phone at one point said, ""We don't have any interest in that — thank you very much,"" and hung up.
Shanaea Burnett and Naimah Turner, two former employees of Prime EFS, said one of their managers repeatedly assigned better trucks and routes to certain drivers.
Burnett said this manager regularly gave her trucks with faulty brakes, broken mirrors, and tires with poor traction. When she pushed back, she said the manager accused her of ""always complaining"" and told her to ""get out of his face.""
Burnett and Turner, in separate interviews, said this same manager routinely denied them work and sent them home without route assignments. Turner filed a complaint with the New Jersey labor department for missing wages, and ultimately left the company for another job. The claim was unresolved as of May.
Burnett left around the same time.
""Enough was enough,"" she said. ""He was mistreating me.""
Amazon said workers experiencing any of the problems described to Business Insider should report them to Amazon management directly so the company can conduct an investigation.
Missing wages and bizarre pay practices
Some delivery drivers have complained about problems with their paychecks.
Thirteen workers across five companies complained about problems with their paychecks.
Irvin, the Colorado-based driver, described recurring issues with paychecks at DeliverOL. Managers would frequently forget to pay overtime or fail to add a new driver to the system so that the person wouldn't receive a paycheck, he said. The problems would get fixed, but it was up to drivers to spot them.
""There was always some excuse,"" Irvin said. ""No one makes that many mistakes that often.""
Blanchard said problems with paychecks are rare and those that arise are fixed within days.
""Do errors happen? Sure they do,"" he said. ""Do they not get corrected? Never."" Blanchard said he typically cuts about two or three checks for errors weekly, and the company employs about 1,000 workers.
A manager at a Texas-based courier company said his company didn't pay drivers overtime for at least a year. That's changing now, since courier companies have started getting hit with lawsuits, he said.
Drivers across the US have brought up similar complaints at some other Amazon-affiliated courier companies, with allegations such as missing wages and failure to provide breaks, in five lawsuits filed against Amazon and six contracted delivery companies, in Illinois, California, Arizona, and Washington over the past three years. Three of the cases have been settled. Amazon did not admit fault in any of the cases.
One of the companies that drivers complained the most about may be Prime EFS, a New Jersey-based courier company that generated more than $7 million in revenues last year, and where employees described a litany of bizarre pay practices.
Prime EFS is run by Frank Mazzola, who was barred from the securities industry in 2014 after accepting a fine to settle an SEC fraud case. Mazzola and his uncle, John Bivona, were ordered to pay nearly $45 million in February for their alleged involvement in a separate fraud case.
""Frank didn't always give me pay stubs and money never added up,"" one former Prime EFS employee, Josh Salgado, said. ""After I confronted him about the money missing ... the next day he called me and he said: 'Don't come into work. We're going to let you go.'""
A former Prime EFS manager, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said Mazzola did not pay drivers on time and ""if somebody messes up or anything happens to a van, or a guy didn't show up to work ... he wouldn't pay him for a week.""
Business Insider initially reached out to Mazzola in May through Prime EFS's email contact form and by a phone number for him listed on Prime EFS's website. Someone called back from that number and asked, ""What business is this?"" and then hung up. His name and number have since been removed from Prime EFS's website.
When reached by phone twice within the last week, Mazzola answered and confirmed his identity, then hung up. Prime EFS is facing ongoing investigations by the US and New Jersey labor departments.
Amazon said it takes reports of misconduct seriously and regularly audits contracted courier companies. It conducted an audit of Prime EFS in late 2017 and found that the company complied with all its specifications.
""Amazon requires all delivery service providers to abide by applicable laws and Amazon's Supplier Code of Conduct, which focuses on fair wages, appropriate working hours and compensation,"" the company said. ""We investigate any claim that a provider isn't complying."" It added that courier employees can contact Amazon management directly or use its chat support line to report problems.
Drivers urinate in their vans so that they can keep up with ever-increasing package volumes
Drivers said they speed and cut corners to meet Amazon's demands for fast package delivery. (The drivers in this story are not employed by Penske).
Amazon factors 30-minute lunch breaks and two additional 15-minute breaks into daily routes for drivers. But with package volumes ballooning, drivers said that stopping to eat or use the restroom would make them fall behind on delivery schedules, which could jeopardize their jobs.
""Packages are [jammed] so tightly into your van that you can't even see. You have packages in the front seat and you have packages sliding from the back to the front, smacking you in the face,"" Rivera, the former Thruway Direct driver, said.
A couple of years ago, drivers typically delivered between 80 and 150 packages on any given day for Amazon. Now volumes regularly exceed 250 parcels daily, drivers said.
""The work is brutal,"" said a manager of a courier company based in New Jersey, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. ""Drivers have to pee in bottles in their vans all the time.""
Ann Chval said female drivers at Tennessee-based JARS TD, where she briefly worked as a driver in 2017, brought buckets and baby wipes to work so they could relieve themselves inside their trucks. Once, a male driver urinated on a customer's lawn in front of her, she said.
Marvic Trejo, a driver who has worked for two courier companies delivering packages for Amazon, said he's found bottles of urine in delivery vans and at the Amazon facilities where he loads packages.
""It's disgusting,"" he said. ""There's no place in society to have people pissing in a bottle. The worst part about it is people don't even throw it away. They just throw it on the ground.""
He recalled one day last summer when a female worker refused to deliver her route because the air-conditioning in her U-Haul was broken on a sweltering day.
Trejo said he would cover for her. When he climbed inside the van, he smelled an overpowering stench and spotted bottles of urine in the passenger side, baking in the heat.
""It was one of the most disgusting experiences I have had to go through,"" he said.
Amazon said claims of drivers urinating in bottles did not reflect the standards it had for its delivery-service providers.
Speeding and blowing stop signs to meet deadlines
In addition to these bathroom hacks, Amazon-affiliated drivers described other disturbing ways they've cut corners to meet delivery timetables.
Eight drivers said they drove over the speed limit regularly. Several blamed Amazon, saying the routes that it maps don't factor in delays related to weather or traffic.
One UK-based driver flipped his delivery truck while speeding. He blamed it in part on job pressure.
Copyright: Liverpool Echo
""We sped like crazy, everyone I know,"" said Donato DiGiulio, a Chicago-area driver who worked for New York-based Need it Now for eight months. ""That's the only way we were able to finish our routes on time. We were zooming through residential areas, all of us, all the time.""
DiGiulio said he almost hit a child playing in the street during a delivery. He slowed down after that and started stopping at stop signs. But then his route times also slowed. Need it Now did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.
Eric Jeffries, a former Army combat-arms specialist, said Amazon required a three- to four-minute turnaround between deliveries when he worked for DeliverOL last year.
He said it was nearly impossible to finish a delivery route within Amazon's nine-hour time frame. He said the delivery job was more physically and emotionally challenging than his time in the Army.
When he was delivering, Jeffries said, he would park illegally, stuff a backpack full of packages, and then physically sprint to complete deliveries on time. He said he lost 30 pounds in his first month on the job.
Despite his best efforts, supervisors told him he wasn't delivering packages quickly enough, and his job was threatened twice. But Jeffries said he didn't blame the companies. He blamed Amazon.
""They get harped on by Amazon on a regular basis, and it pushes them to act inhuman toward workers,"" he said.
Blanchard said drivers should not run from one stop to the next, and that managers should not threaten workers' jobs unless they're consistently underperforming or failing to show up to work.
Amazon said its package loads fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including customer demand, and that it's always evaluating routes and making adjustments, such as hiring more drivers in high-demand areas.
Amazon can track drivers using 'rabbits' and call to check on them if deliveries aren't completed fast enough
Amazon monitors drivers through handheld package scanners called ""rabbits.""
Some drivers said they felt added pressure to maintain a rapid pace on the road because Amazon tracked them and might call their supervisors if something looked off.
Amazon monitors drivers through handheld package scanners called ""rabbits."" These scanners enable Amazon to update customers on an order's location through the company's new service, Map Tracking.
It also means that if a driver stalls on a route, Amazon might take notice.
""Amazon will call our dispatchers and say: 'Your driver is behind by 25 packages. Why is that?' And then our dispatchers are pressured to respond,"" said Davian Delvalle, a driver who worked for two Amazon-affiliated delivery companies in New Jersey.
If drivers fall behind, dispatchers — the supervisors who manage drivers on the road — will ""go crazy,"" he said. ""They will keep blowing up your phone and distract you while you are trying to work.""
Amazon said the calls were meant to check on a driver's safety, to see if they needed help finishing routes.
Some dispatchers saw things that way, but others were alarmed, drivers said. LeShaun Spruell, a driver of two years for TL Transportation, said he's had both kinds of bosses.
At one delivery station Spruell worked for, in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, dispatchers frequently asked him to hurry up, he said. At his new delivery station, priorities seem better.
""If something goes on, they want to know if you need help,"" he said.
Amazon will sometimes offer extra payment for unplanned delays, such as unexpected traffic. One company is now asking its employees to text dispatchers immediately if something slows them down so that they can account for the unplanned time and apply for extra payment from Amazon.
But courier companies are careful not to ask too much of Amazon. Many said they were afraid of getting contracts yanked, employees told Business Insider, and that the unbalanced relationship leaves no one to defend the drivers.
""Amazon DSP owners usually are very afraid of Amazon,"" a courier company manager said. ""Amazon has all the power. They're the one that invited you in. They can give you 10 routes. They could give you one route. Or they could say goodbye.""
Amazon says most routes are completed in under nine hours, but pay stubs suggest otherwise
Ip, the Amazon spokeswoman, said most drivers — over 90% — complete routes in a reasonable time frame and that drivers were encouraged to take breaks any time they needed.
""The majority of drivers complete their daily routes in under nine hours, which factor in breaks, traffic patterns, and more,"" Ip said. ""And in cases where inclement weather or traffic may impact a driver's ability to complete a customer delivery on time, Amazon works closely with delivery service providers to make adjustments to their delivery route and, if necessary, DSPs call drivers to return to the station.""
Business Insider reviewed payroll documents for several drivers. they suggested that drivers' workdays can last much longer than nine hours.
An analysis of seven days of Prime EFS payroll information, for example, showed that over the course of more than 200 routes in September, drivers were clocked in for more than 11 hours, on average.
Some work shifts, which begin when a driver arrives at the warehouse until the time they return at night, were 16 hours.
An Amazon-affiliated job listing for drivers also says drivers' workdays far exceed nine hours.
Southern Star Express recently advertised that drivers typically work 12 to 15 hours straight. They should expect to make between 200 and 250 stops a day, delivering at least 25 packages an hour.
""You will run until you deliver ALL your packages for the day,"" the ad read. ""If you finish your route early, you will pick up a rescue route for an additional $1 per package rescued. You are responsible for attempting to deliver all the packages you were assigned regardless of the time.""
Some drivers say they're getting screwed, but it might not be Amazon's problem. Customers could be to blame.
Amazon says most routes are completed in under nine hours, but pay stubs suggest otherwise. (The drivers in this story are not employed by Penske).
Amazon's delivery drivers may have a lot of problems. But that might not be Amazon's problem to solve because it doesn't technically employ them.
Contract work has exploded across the US in the past 40 years. It's an increasingly popular option for companies looking to cut costs, streamline operations, and meet sudden increases in demand.
Most hotels, for example, once hired their own front-desk personnel and maid services. Now many hotels largely outsource to contract workers and third parties. Uber and Lyft built multibillion-dollar ride-hailing services without technically employing a single driver.
The transition from full-time employees to contract workers has created a seismic shift in the American workforce. It is financially beneficial for corporations, and the executives who run them. Amazon said it uses this model to empower small businesses. But for those who actually do the grunt work, it can make them feel powerless. Labor experts say they often receive low pay, few benefits, and have no real allies in these difficult-to-regulate third-party environments.
""This [shift to contract work] creates downward pressure on wages and benefits, murkiness about who bears responsibility for work conditions, and increased likelihood that basic labor standards will be violated,"" David Weil, the head of the US Labor Department's wage and hour division under the Obama administration, wrote in his book ""The Fissured Workplace: Why Work Became So Bad for So Many and What Can Be Done to Improve It.""
These trends are worse in an industry such as logistics, where cost is the only real competitive difference that sets apart one courier company that Amazon might choose to employ versus another, according to Beth Gutelius, a senior researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
""You have everyone slightly under-bidding each other, so much so that it would be impossible for them to pay their workers even the minimum wage,"" Gutelius said. ""It creates a competitive market among subcontractors. Who ends up paying the price, then, is the workers.""
There are no unions fighting on the behalf of Amazon drivers, either. Most are employed by small courier companies across multiple locations, and there is no large organization where they can band together.
Part of the problem are the customers.
Amazon has created such a seamless shopping experience that customers are ordering more and more without stopping to consider how packages actually show up at their doors.
""The expectation that Amazon has set — of free, fast shipping — it's almost an impossibility,"" Tia Koonse, a legal and policy research manager at the UCLA Labor Center, said. ""It costs money to ship things.""
""Because it's this invisible process we, as consumers, are willing to overlook it and what's happening to workers,"" Koonse added.
For Vargas, whose fingers have healed since getting trapped in his truck door, the feeling of being invisible resonates.
He accepted another job in a different industry, in August, and not just because his superiors mocked him. It's mostly because he couldn't handle any more 13-hour days.
He knows Amazon and its millions of shoppers aren't likely to slow down any time soon.
""I am a human being that has emotions, and it's draining,"" he said. ""It beats you down.""

Amazon software engineer in second month of protests against conditions
By Paul Fuller and Kayla Costa22 March 2019
Oleg Churyumov, an Amazon software engineer at Amazon, has been protesting across Seattle, Washington, since February against the soul-crushing work conditions forced upon professional white-collar workers by the company.
Officially on a leave of absence, he has picketed outside the central office where he worked, campaigned at various stores and an Amazon fulfillment center in the city, and carried out a five-day hunger strike without water. He has published video and written updates on his personal blog.
Though initially driven to protest after a terrible personal experience with overwork and abuse by management, Oleg considers his protest for the “civil rights” of all 500,000 employees worldwide that confront the same policies and culture of Amazon. His main protest slogan is, “Insist on the highest standards of oppression to our families,” a sarcastic spin-off from one of Amazon’s company mottos, “Insist on the Highest Standards,” often invoked to justify the grueling conditions that workers face.
Oleg with original banner
After reaching out directly to the World Socialist Web Site to share his story, he sat down for an interview with WSWS reporters during which he explained the background and events of the protest.
Originally from Russia, Oleg began working as a software engineer at Amazon in 2017. Initially, he thought the job was great, as he enjoyed his salary and co-workers. Despite being assigned to a job with inadequate training, he said the first few weeks on the job “began well enough.” However, the enjoyment quickly disappeared after the company encouraged workers to offer criticism to management through a supposedly anonymous internal feedback system.
“Someone started asking me how I liked the management team and everything. I started answering some of these questions in the negative about my manager, for example that my manager needed to improve his leadership skills. Later I found out that this system is not anonymous.
“My manager can easily calculate that I was the person who posted this. He called me into a one-on-one meeting and asked me to stop posting the feedback. Since then, for all the year of my work, I suffered multiple forms of oppression from my manager.”
While his manager allowed most employees to clock in at 11:00 a.m. and work from home without restrictions, Oleg was forced to come into the office at 7:00 a.m. to work by himself, work on weekends, and sometimes until 9:00 at night. Work weeks of 100 hours were not uncommon. He explained, “Some days that was extremely lethal. I had less than five hours for sleep, including travel to home.”
To escape these punitive working conditions, he asked for a transfer to another department, which is common for professional workers. Oleg’s manager told him he would be able to transfer to offices in New York City only after his wife found employment there. After she moved to NYC with the youngest of their two children, his manager said he “changed his mind.”
“He broke his promise,” Oleg said. “We are in a situation in which my wife and I are single parents. I am taking care of one of our children, and she is taking care of our second child. At the time my son was one year old, and my daughter was three, which means we had to take care of them all of the time. And that’s just because my manager changed his mind.”
Soon after this, their three-year-old daughter, who lived with Oleg, was diagnosed with a developmental delay and needed to attend regular therapy. To take care of her needs, Oleg asked his manager about flexible hours to accommodate her therapy and daycare schedule. “Everybody in [my] team was granted with ability to work from home once a week. If we have our laptops and Internet, we can work from anywhere in the world. My manager told me I was prohibited from working from home, that I had to work weekends and sometimes come in at 7:00 a.m.,” the same response he got after submitting complaints through the internal feedback system.
“He directly prohibited me from taking care of my child. In February of 2018, my daughter became seriously sick. She was sick for three or four days, and she went to the doctor and she didn’t go to daycare. I took leave perfectly legally. I have a full legal right to take leave, especially for a short time to take care of sick family members. I do not need approval from my manager for that, but I notified my whole team that I would be gone. After I came back from the leave, my manager sent me a disciplinary notice.”
In May, Oleg spoke to his manager about the issues he had with the reaction to his request for time off to care for his family. The manager told him, “If you don’t like something, just quit.” For the next several weeks, Oleg faced an intentionally hostile work environment designed to push him to quit voluntarily, rather than get into the legal issues of firing someone after months of discrimination and retaliation from management.
Not wanting to quit but also unable to endure the environment, Oleg made a complaint to Human Resources, which opened an official investigation into his current and past issues. “During that investigation, they confirmed everything that I said. They said 99 percent of my statements were true, and that I had all the evidence, documents, e-mails. But they said, ‘We confirmed everything. But our conclusion is as follows: there is no violation of Amazon policy here. Your statements do not constitute violation of Amazon policy.’
“I asked, ‘If someone prohibited me from treating my disabled child, that’s not a violation?’ He [the HR representative] said there was no such policy.”
Oleg was then placed in Amazon’s Pivot Program, a program introduced in 2017 ostensibly as an appeals process for “chronic underperformers.” It has been called a “kangaroo court” by critics of the program, as it allows peers to “confirm that a worker was low-performing” without the worker being allowed to rebut or explain him- or herself.
Refusing to resign and give into the dirty tricks of Amazon, Oleg has been on long-term leave since the fall of 2018. As Amazon sponsored his working EB3 visa, resigning would invalidate his application.
Banner being used this week
Last month, in February, he started public protests with a banner in front of Amazon buildings, posting videos on YouTube on most days. “They prohibited me to speak up inside of Amazon, so that’s why I have gone to protest outside,” he said. Oleg received large volumes of harassment, threats, insults and defamation online, initially posted by Amazon managers until they switched to anonymous accounts to avoid legal consequences.
He explained: “I decided to do a hunger strike in public, a hunger strike without water. You don’t drink anything. During the hunger strike, they [Amazon] continued to post hate speech.” They also withdrew his health benefits. “I was so stressed, but I sustained it until the fifth day. On the fifth day, my physician called me and said that I urgently need to take tests. My body was shutting down. He told me if I didn’t stop voluntarily, I would be involuntarily taken to the hospital. So I decided to stop on my own.”
Though the weather or family obligations disrupt the schedule occasionally, Oleg continues to protest on a near-daily basis at Amazon offices in downtown Seattle. “I am getting a lot of support,” he said. “I get messages every day. People approach me on the street and say they know who I am. Amazon employees approached me and brought me hot coffee, saying they support me.”
Other workers have shared similar stories with him, and have discussed the atrocious working conditions of the workers in distribution centers. “The most notorious story was from a fulfillment center worker who approached me and listened to my story. He said, ‘Well, do you think you are suffering? You are not, you don’t know. You have never worked at Amazon fulfillment center. Go there, and you will see what hell looks like.’”
Oleg often discusses the horrendous conditions facing warehouse workers. He even took his campaign to a fulfillment center near Seattle to talk with workers about his protest. Rejecting the pitting of salaried professional workers against hourly workers, Oleg is striving to represent all Amazon workers around the world in a fight against the oppressive policies and principles of the company. He often discusses the use of immigrant and foreign workers to drive up the exploitation of all workers, including those in the United States.
In a video response to the WSWS coverage of the suicide crisis in Amazon warehouses, Oleg said: “Amazon understands that if they kill an employee, another ten candidates that could be even better than him are standing in front of the door waiting for job applications because of the labor market. In many small cities, Amazon warehouses and fil centers play a major role in monopoly of the labor market.
Though Oleg acknowledges that he does not endure the physical stress that fulfillment center employees do, the same culture of exploiting every ounce of human labor exists in the professional side of the company. “White collar workers are paid on a monthly salary, regardless of the number of hours we work. If we work eight hours a day or sixteen hours a day, if we work on weekends or not. It is very logical for Amazon to force us to work sixteen hours a day, including weekends. A hundred hours a week, that is normal for Amazon. Very logical. Why should an employee work less if his cost [of labor power] is the same?”
While Amazon praises its work standards that it rejects being “unreasonably high,” Oleg explains, “Yes, we think these standards are ‘unreasonably high.’ It’s unreasonable that people are committing suicide, that people are dying, that their relatives are dying.”
“This is not fault of some person. Managers are not killers. They are people just like me and you. It is fault of the system, of the company.”
Oleg clarified this explanation in a recent blog post, in which he compares the corporation to Spartacus and Nazi rule, “Amazon treats its employees worse than slaves. Just for experiment (curiosity, game), employees are forced to work until the ‘limit.’ And the limit is never reachable, according to the official company mission. The only way to know the limit is the moment of death. In wild nature, predator does not kill victim for a ‘game,’ for ‘experiment’.”

Hunger Strike. No food. No water. Until Amazon changes inhumane policies.
Hunger strike without water. Day 1. Let's go.
I declare hunger strike without food, without water, without anything else (vitamins etc). The only thing I take in is air. Since yesterday night, I didn't eat, didn't drink anything. I strike because I want Amazon to change its inhumane policies. My proposal of changes is here.
My story of oppression at Amazon is here. Since my first publication, a lot of people contacted me and shared their stories. They asked me to continue fighting because I fight not for myself only. Thousands of employees at Amazon suffer and it is not normal. It is not just single example. It is toxic culture growing from toxic company policies. If nobody stops this, they will go further. It is not normal that employees are punished because their parents are dying. It is not normal that employees are punished because their children are disabled. It is normal that employees are prevented to use restrooms and peeing in the bottles. Every year situation becomes worse. Google it if you didn't do so yet, and you will be surprised. The situation in Amazon is so bad, then the company even pays money for posts of bots on the Internet to somehow improve its reputation.
I personally confirm this because I worked for Amazon since 2017. If we will not stop them what will be next year? Every year the company becomes more rich and powerful. The later we start to oppose the more difficult it will be.
I don’t fight against Amazon. I don’t fight against its business. I wish to Amazon and Jeff the best. Rather I fight against the toxic culture and oppression. I fight against its policies and principles. By taking this feedback Amazon can become more successful company. In the long term, they can’t sustain on the principles of inhumanity.
Initially my plan was: In the morning, I will come to Whole Foods at Denny way and stay there with the banner. Yeah, it is funny to hunger strike in front of the store which is full of food. But this is the most crowded place. Then I can attract much attention. Also on the other side of the road there is Amazon HR building. They will see my banner every day. Then everybody will know their reaction or lack of reaction. Nobody could tell “Amazon didn’t know about that”. But Whole Foods (owned by Amazon) asked me to leave. Now I will stay near of the Spheres, on the side of 6th Ave. Forgive me Amazon, I will use your Internet.
It is cold outside. While fasting, I will feel colder. Thus, I will make breaks by making myself warm in the nearest store, cafe, my friend’s car or library. According to scientists, first days my body will even need restroom. I will clean teeth and if possible take a shower. Science tells body smells not good during starvation. To avoid accusations of eating or drinking something, I want to make everything clear and transparent. Thus, every day I will make weighing, videotaping it and posting online. Anyone is welcome to approach me in person and ask to demonstrate weighing. My weight as of today is 168 lbs.
Unfortunately, I can’t sleep near of Amazon office during such cold nights (but I would like). Thus, I will go my place in the northern Seattle until the next morning.
Today I have sent email to Jeff at jeff@amazon.com with the contents of this post. In response to NYT article, Jeff sent email to everybody saying “if you know of any stories like those reported, I want you to escalate to HR. You can also email me directly at jeff@amazon.com. Even if it’s rare or isolated, our tolerance for any such lack of empathy needs to be zero”. Let’s see whether tolerance of Jeff to that is zero or not. It was 3 years after NYT publication. Culture is still the same.
I you support me, please share this post to anywhere on the Internet. Send the link to your friend - even that helps. If you disagree with me, just show up, come and discuss. Write me a message. Locate me on Facebook. Give me a call. I promise open discussion with anyone who can open himself and bring arguments without insulting. Don’t stay anonymous. Don’t let others think you are Amazon Ambassador troll. You risk nothing if you tell your name whether in person or on the Internet and bring true logical arguments.
Peace PS: I am not kidding, I'm not bluffing.
9 am. Came to Whole Foods
Fixed the banner on the wall.
9:20 am. Free speech is restricted again. Whole Foods manager called sheriff and they approached me together. By sheriff I mean real big guy with a gun, form and cool black glasses. Manager asked me stop doing it near of the Whole Foods. Well, I am not surprised because of the following. Amazon officially bought Whole Foods. There was a homeless guy right near of me near of the Whole Foods. He was there for the last 2 weeks every day (I saw him during the protest). He was never asked to go away. As soon as I started hunger strike, I was asked.
9:40 am. Maybe this is even better. Instead of Whole Foods, I can strike right near of the Amazon building. For now I am near of the Spheres, on the side of 6th Ave. I changed the initial description of the post. I took the public sidewalk (property of the City of Seattle). Now I can be asked to leave only if Jeff would bribe the City.
Short video of today:
5 pm. It became really cold. Spoke with few people and went home. I feel myself tired. Just need to charge electronics, then sleep and come back tomorrow to Spheres. Maybe watch some movie about public protests.

Amazon.co.uk, Britain's biggest online retailer, generated sales of more than £3.3bn in the country last year but paid no corporation tax on any of the profits from that income – and is under investigation by the UK tax authorities.
Regulatory filings by parent company Amazon.com with the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) show the tax inquiry into the UK operation, which sells nearly one in four books sold in Britain, focuses on a period when ownership of the British business was transferred to a Luxembourg company.
The SEC filings, highlighted by Bookseller magazine, show that in the past three years, Amazon has generated sales of more than £7.6bn in the UK without attracting any corporation tax on the profits from those sales.
HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) refused to confirm it was investigating Amazon.co.uk, and its inquiries could be a routine audit. But Amazon's tax affairs are being investigated in the US, China, Germany, France, Japan and Luxembourg.
Amazon, which launched in the UK in 1998, is the UK's most popular retail website, with more visitors than Argos, Next and Tesco. It sells a vast array of goods other than books and recently won an award for offering the best customer service in the UK.
But the business that people voted for is not British-owned. The UK operation avoids tax as the ownership of the main Amazon.co.uk business was transferred to a Luxembourg company in 2006. The UK business is now owned by Amazon EU Sarl and the UK operation is classed only as an ""order fulfilment"" business. All payments for books, DVDs and other goods go directly to Luxembourg. The UK business is simply a delivery organisation.
The latest 2010 accounts for Amazon EU Sarl show the Luxembourg office employed just 134 people, but generated turnover of €7.5bn (£6.5bn). In the same year, the UK operation employed 2,265 people and reported a turnover of just £147m. According to the SEC filings, UK sales that year were between £2.3bn and £3.2bn. Amazon in the US has earned an average 3.5% profit margin over the past three years.
UK sales over the past three years, according to the SEC filings, were between £7.6bn and £10.3bn. If the same profit margin was applied, this would have generated taxable profits of £266m-£360m and yielded notional UK corporation tax of up to £100m.
However, in the nine years between 2003 and 2011, the UK-registered company has reported a cumulative net tax bill of just £3m – of which £1.9m was incurred in 2011. This is not the tax actually paid to HMRC. that information is not available because the UK company is not required to produce a cash flow statement.
The Guardian asked Amazon why it paid no UK corporation tax on the £3bn it takes out of the economy. The company declined to answer any specific questions on its tax affairs. Instead, in an email, it said: ""Amazon EU serves tens of millions of customers and sellers throughout Europe from multiple consumer websites in a number of languages, dispatching products to all 27 countries in the EU. We have a single European headquarters in Luxembourg with hundreds of employees to manage this complex operation.""
Richard Murphy, of the Tax Justice Network, said rewriting tax rules to prevent arrangements such as those used by Amazon.co.uk would be a huge task. ""The key issue is, what is sold here and what is sold 'into' here? The answer is to deem distance sellers [as] resident in the UK with regard to their sales made here. That would be a big issue to take on.""
Amazon would not comment on why it switched ownership of the UK business to Luxembourg in a complex manoeuvre that saw the UK company's shares change hands four times. However, the US parent company has suggested it may have been done to reduce the group's tax bill. In a 2006 SEC filing, the company referred to ""establishing our European headquarters in Luxembourg, which we expect will benefit our effective tax rate over time"".
Amazon's UK operations are also poised to benefit from Luxembourg ownership in the battle for the lucrative and fast-growing ebook market. Being based in Luxembourg means it can charge VAT on ebook sales at the local rate of 3% rather than the 20% VAT imposed on British-based ebook retailers.
In its most recent SEC annual filing, Amazon admits: ""The effective tax rate in 2011, 2010, and 2009 was lower than the 35% US federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the US in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the US. Such earnings primarily relate to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg.""
Amazon is currently disputing a tax bill of nearly £1bn imposed by US authorities relating to transfer pricing – a mechanism used by multinationals to trade goods and services among group companies.
It is also under fire in the US as it does not collect any sales taxes on products sold in states where it does not have an office or warehouse. It is believed to only collect sales tax in five states, but other states are now planning to alter state legislation to impose the sales tax on the company."ÿÿAmazon: £7bn sales, no UK corporation tax

TOKYO (MarketWatch) -- Japan's taxation authorities ordered a Seattle-based affiliate of online retailer Amazon.com Inc. to pay 14 billion yen ($119 million) in back taxes, according to published reports Sunday.
Amazon.com AMZN, +0.57% has requested U.S. and Japanese tax authorities review the matter in light of the two nations' bilateral tax treaty, the Asahi newspaper and Kyodo news reported Sunday, both citing unnamed sources.
U.S. companies that engage in business in Japan without branch offices aren't required to file tax returns or pay taxes to the Japanese government.
The Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau has determined that two Japanese wholly-owned subsidiaries of Amazon.com have in effect acted as branch offices of the affiliate, Amazon.com International Sales Inc., and now owe taxes for the three years through December 2005, the reports said.
The two subsidiaries -- Amazon Japan Logistics K.K. and Amazon Japan K.K. -- are commissioned to carry out merchandise distribution and other functions. The company has booked sales posted in Japan as those of the Seattle-based company, while paying only U.S. taxes on the sales.
Amazon.com, for its part, disclosed that it had been ordered by Japanese tax authorities to pay the back taxes, in its annual report for its 2008 business year.
The issue surfaces as parent Amazon.com faces calls for tax payments back in the U.S. Amazon recently canceled affiliate relationships in several states under the threat of having to collect sales tax in those markets.

Burglar bill: remind you of anyone?
The children’s author Allan Ahlberg responsible for beloved (and possibly the most English-sounding) children’s books The Jolly Postman, Burglar Bill and Each Peach Pear Plum has shown that we can continue to love him now we’re adults —because he’s just refused to accept an award sponsored by Amazon.
In an open letter to The Bookseller, Ahlberg told how he was initially “delighted” to hear he’d won the inaugural Booktrust Lifetime Achievement Award, which was voted for by 120,000 school kids from around the country. But on learning that the award was sponsored by Amazon Kindle, he felt obliged to refuse it. In his letter he writes:
The Amazon sponsorship deal is a mistake. Amazon’s baleful influence on the British book trade is frequently referred to—see also what’s happening with Hachette in America—but it is its position as “The UK’s No1 Tax Avoider” (Ethical Consumer) that bothers me.
Tax, fairly applied to us all, is a good thing. It pays for schools, hospitals—libraries! When companies like Amazon cheat—paying 0.1% on billions, pretending it is earning money not in the UK, but in Luxembourg— that’s a bad thing. We should surely, at the very least, say that it is bad and on no account give it any support or, by association, respectability.
While Ahlberg praised Booktrust, an organization that aims to “change lives through reading”, he pointed to a major problem with the charity associating itself with Amazon:
...Amazon, via its sponsorship, gets up close to Booktrust and hopes that some of this rubs off. Sadly, I’d say, it also works the other way: Amazon sponsors Booktrust. Booktrust sponsors Amazon, and all of us— writers, illustrators, publishers, judges—get drawn in.
Ahlberg is refusing to have his name, and his life’s work, associated with a business that is radically dismantling the current reading and writing ecosystem, shown most clearly in the recent author outcry against Amazon’s treatment of Hachette titles. His letter is a reminder that Amazon are still not paying their taxes in Britain, despite repeated calls to do so by citizens, the media and government. This surely makes Amazon’s involvement with Booktrust a contradiction in terms: they give with one hand, while taking away with another.
In declining the award, Ahlberg sends out a clear and valuable message to all of his avid, small readers: “kids, when you grow up, pay your taxes— or else!” I hope parents up and down the country will be explaining this to their kids during bedtime stories tonight, with Amazon featuring as the big bad monster of society.

The information is currently strewn across some 400 centers, and the Pentagon’s top brass believes that consolidating it into one cloud-based system, the way the CIA did in 2013, will make it more secure and accessible. That’s why, on July 26, the Defense Department issued a request for proposals called JEDI, short for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure. Whoever winds up landing the winner-take-all contract will be awarded $10 billion—instantly becoming one of America’s biggest federal contractors.
But when JEDI was issued, on the day Congress recessed for the summer, the deal appeared to be rigged in favor of a single provider: Amazon. According to insiders familiar with the 1,375-page request for proposal, the language contains a host of technical stipulations that only Amazon can meet, making it hard for other leading cloud-services providers to win—or even apply for—the contract. One provision, for instance, stipulates that bidders must already generate more than $2 billion a year in commercial cloud revenues—a “bigger is better” requirement that rules out all but a few of Amazon’s rivals.
What’s more, the process of crafting JEDI bears all the hallmarks of the swamp that Trump has vowed to drain. Though there has long been talk about the Defense Department joining the cloud, the current call for bids was put together only after Defense Secretary James Mattis hired a D.C. lobbyist who had previously consulted for Amazon. The lobbyist, Sally Donnelly, served as a top advisor to Mattis while the details of JEDI were being hammered out. During her tenure, Mattis flew to Seattle to tour Amazon’s headquarters and meet with Jeff Bezos. Then, as the cloud-computing contract was being finalized, Donnelly’s former lobbying firm, SBD Advisors, was bought by an investment fund with ties to Amazon’s cloud-computing unit.
Congressional insiders who have reviewed the process question whether Donnelly violated a federal law that bars executive-branch employees from participating in government decisions that affect their personal interests. “We recently became aware of serious and possible criminal violations related to the Amazon cloud DOD contract process,” says a high-ranking congressional staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We are concerned about the implications of the appearance of conflicts of interest and impropriety related to how Pentagon personnel with close ties to Amazon may have influenced multi-billion-dollar cloud contracts.”
Donnelly, through her lawyer, denies any wrongdoing. “Ms. Donnelly sold her entire stake in SBD Advisors before setting foot in the Pentagon,” the lawyer said. “From that moment forward, she has had absolutely no financial or other interest in SBD Advisors or its clients.”
But whether or not any legal or ethical boundaries were crossed, Amazon’s high-ranking connections in the Pentagon underscore how Jeff Bezos continues to wield influence in Washington, even as the president himself rails against the online goliath. It also raises a larger question: How do you drain a swamp when the alligators are bigger than ever? “When you have that kind of access during a $10 billion procurement, that compromises the integrity of the procurement,” says John Weiler, an industry expert who runs a trade group that includes many leading IT firms. “Amazon was basically able to write the playbook.”
The details of the JEDI contract provide a window into how new players like Amazon are faring in the notoriously insular world of defense contracting. Donnelly, the lobbyist at the center of the controversy, is a former reporter for Time who set up her own lobbying shop a half mile from the White House in 2012. Stacked with former high-ranking officials from the NSA and the Pentagon, SBD Advisors boasted that it helped clients “navigate the political and media environment in the national security space” and “maximize opportunities.” Among Donnelly’s clients was Amazon Web Services, the online giant’s cloud-computing unit.
During her time at SBD, Donnelly grew close to General Mattis. When Mattis was nominated by President Trump to lead the Pentagon, she was brought on to run his Senate confirmation process. The day after he was sworn in, Donnelly went to work for him as a special advisor.
Donnelly enjoyed direct access to Mattis, and the cloud community knew it. “It was a well known thing that if you needed something you would give it to Sally, and Sally would give it to the defense secretary,” says an insider who worked closely with Donnelly. As one of the secretary’s top advisors, Donnelly vetted his schedule and arranged his meetings. And among the most signficant meetings that took place under her watch was a visit to Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle on August 10, 2017. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos personally tweeted a photo of himself hosting #SecDef Mattis.
Amazon insists that Bezos and Mattis did not discuss the cloud bid during the visit. But the defense secretary reportedly returned from the visit convinced that the Pentagon needed to turn its data over to a commercial cloud provider. A month after Mattis met with Bezos, on September 13, 2017, the Pentagon put out a memo citing the defense secretary’s visit to Seattle, which it hailed as an “epicenter of innovation.” The memo then called for a cloud bid that would cover all of the Pentagon’s data for its 2.3 million employees and service members. Amazon, it appeared, was suddenly in prime position to land a $10 billion defense contract.
Much of the language of JEDI, in fact, seems specifically tailored for Jeff Bezos. “Everybody immediately knew that it was for Amazon,” says a rival bidder who asked not to be named. To even make a bid, a provider must maintain a distance of at least 150 miles between its data centers and provide “32 GB of RAM”—specifications that few providers other than Amazon can meet.
The Defense Department says that neither Mattis nor Donnelly were involved in shaping JEDI. But congressional insiders plan to take a closer look at how and when Donnelly benefited from the sale of her lobbying firm. According to her financial disclosure forms, she sold her stake in SBD Advisors for $1.17 million two days before she went to work for Mattis. But she continued to receive payments while she was working at the Pentagon, at a time when Amazon remained a client of the firm. And in March, two weeks after Donnelly left the Pentagon, SBD was bought by C5 Capital, a private equity firm with direct ties to Amazon.
On its website, C5 trumpets that it is working with Amazon Web Services to “meet the growth opportunity being created by the geographic expansion of AWS.” In 2016, C5 and AWS partnered in Bahrain-based fund that backed cloud startups in Africa and the Middle East. “We’ve been partnering with C5 around the world for a long time,” Teresa Carlson, Amazon’s vice president for worldwide public sector, said at a joint event in Washington in May 2017.
Leading Amazon rivals like Google, Microsoft, and IBM are up in arms about the way JEDI was crafted to benefit Amazon. “Everybody in the industry was quite surprised,” says one rival bidder who asked not to be identified. On August 7, Oracle filed an official protest with the Government Accountability Office, arguing that JEDI violates federal procurement laws. In addition, some cybersecurity experts warn that allowing a single company to manage the Pentagon’s data will make it vulnerable to cyberattacks and reduce innovation.
Amazon and others says that it makes sense not to spread the data around. “If you don’t have good experience and a workforce that understands cloud, it’s going to be really hard to try to absorb multiple clouds and create multiple architectures,” Carlson told the Washington Post. And the company’s widely perceived edge in the JEDI process underscores that bigger is still considered better when it comes to defense contracts. Amazon Web Services generated $17.5 billion last year—nearly 10 percent of the online giant’s total revenues. “Amazon was an early mover in this market,” says William Schneider, a defense analyst with the Hudson Institute. “It’s a dominant player, and they are the initial providers of cloud services in the intelligence community.”
In a larger sense, the JEDI contract represents the growing clout that technology companies are wielding in Washington—and how they are increasingly wiring the swamp for their own benefit. Amazon has spent $67 million on lobbying since 2000—including more this year than Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo combined. Its Washington office employs more than 100 lobbyists, including 68 so-called “revolvers”—officials who have moved from government employment to the private sector. The company also employs many former officials with insider connections, including Scott Renda, who worked for the Office of Management and Budget’s cloud computing division, and Anne Rung, who served as the government’s chief acquisition officer.
If you think the JEDI contract is big, consider this: Last year, working for Bezos, Rung helped pass the so-called Amazon amendment, a provision buried in a defense authorization bill that will establish Amazon as the go-to portal for every online purchase the government makes—some $53 billion every year. President Trump may enjoy firing off incendiary tweets attacking Amazon. But Bezos is quietly finding new ways to bolster his empire with billions in federal tax dollars. And the Pentagon, it appears, is helping him do it.
Editor’s Note: The story has been corrected to note that a few of Amazon’s competitors may be able to meet JEDI’s request for 32 GB of RAM, and to delete a reference suggesting that the term “ruggedized” is an Amazon-generated standard. In a statement issued in response to the story, Amazon Web Services said it is “eager to participate in a fair, open, and competitive bidding process that allows the customer to thoroughly analyze the various providers and select the solutions that best meet their needs.”"ÿÿHas Bezos Become More Powerful in D.C.

SEATTLE — Like a college applicant waiting for that special message in the mail, officials in Boston got what they wanted on Thursday: a cryptic four-sentence note informing them that the city made the finals in its bid to host Amazon’s second headquarters.
“We would like to move Boston forward in the process so we can continue to learn more about your community, your talent, and potential real estate options,” Holly Sullivan, an Amazon executive, wrote in the note. “Please email me back with available times for a call so we can discuss next steps.”
Boston was one of 20 places in the United States and Canada that made Amazon’s list, joining cities that had been widely expected to make the cut, like Denver and Dallas, and surprises like Nashville and Columbus, Ohio.
The winner could get up to 50,000 high-paying jobs and $5 billion in investment, figures that Amazon has dangled in front of local officials, setting off an unprecedented competition to be the second home for one of the internet’s mightiest companies. In all, 238 cities and regions applied to bring the company to town, many using promises of tax breaks and public charm offensives to gain favor with the e-commerce giant.
The finalists include places like Newark, where the local economy has struggled for decades, and hip centers like Miami and Austin, Tex. For other cities, like Los Angeles and New York, luring Amazon would cement their place as centers of the tech industry.

In seeking a home for its second headquarters, Amazon winnowed a list of 238 candidates to 20 finalists, including Atlanta, Nashville and Miami.

The other finalists are Atlanta. Chicago. Indianapolis. Montgomery County, Md.. Northern Virginia. Philadelphia. Pittsburgh. Raleigh, N.C.. Washington and Toronto — the only one outside the United States.
Officials from the 20 locations celebrated their selections and, in most cases, reiterated their pitches for why Amazon should ultimately pick them. Ras Baraka, mayor of Newark, said Amazon would have “a tremendous social and economic impact on this city, state and region by coming to Newark.”
Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, the province where Toronto is located, reacted with what could be perceived as a dig at her American competitors. Toronto was the “obvious choice” for Amazon, in part because of Canada’s universal health care system and its openness to immigrants, she said.
“We are already welcoming the best and brightest talent from around the world — no matter where you come from, you are welcome and you will feel at home in Ontario,” Ms. Wynne said.
Many of the cities selected had been considered shoo-ins from the moment Amazon announced the search in September, largely because they closely matched the attributes that the company said it wanted in a second home, which it is calling HQ2. Those criteria included a metropolitan area with a population greater than one million and the ability to attract and keep strong technical talent.
But there were several surprise snubs, too. Amazon rejected applications from Detroit, Phoenix and San Diego, plus all the bids from Mexico. The list leaned east, away from the tech-saturated hubs of the West Coast.
“Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough — all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,” Ms. Sullivan, Amazon’s head of economic development, said in a statement. “Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.”
Amazon shrouded its selection process in secrecy. On Thursday, the company said little about how it had pared down the list, other than to say it based its choices on the criteria it laid out for the search earlier.
The process was conducted by a team of about a dozen people within Amazon, including economists, human resources managers and executives who oversee real estate, according to people briefed on the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were private. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive who was the mastermind behind turning the search into a public process and coined the term “HQ2,” was also involved, the people said.
The veil of secrecy kept even the finalist cities in the dark until Thursday’s announcement.
Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, was on her way into the office when a deputy mayor called and said that the city had made the Top 20. “I was, of course, pleased, but not that surprised because we know that Washington, D.C., matches what Amazon is looking for,” Ms. Bowser said.
Hans Riemer, president of the Montgomery County Council, found out from a friend via text message.
“My heart skipped a beat,” he said.
The process will now shift into a new phase, with Amazon representatives communicating more directly with the finalist cities as they prepare to select a winner later this year — and perhaps with cities being even more outspoken about why they should be chosen. Emissaries from Amazon are expected to visit the finalist locations in person.
Some of the finalists are neighbors, setting up what are likely to be intense regional rivalries. Ms. Bowser said Amazon’s selection of Montgomery County and Northern Virginia — both near Washington — spoke to the appeal of the region’s work force.
“Of course,” she added, “we believe that Washington, D.C. — with our top talent and world-class amenities — is the right place for Amazon HQ2.”
Mayor Baraka said that Newark has a “friendly rivalry” with its bigger neighbor, New York, while adding that his city enjoys the advantages of cheaper real estate, space for development in its downtown and lots of fiber optic network capacity.
Amazon needs a second headquarters because it’s bursting at the seams in its hometown, Seattle. Mr. Bezos founded the company there in 1994, and it has since transformed the city, employing more than 40,000 there. That expansion has also contributed to Seattle’s soaring cost of living and its traffic woes.
To lure applicants, Amazon showered local politicians with its own data about the effect the company has had on the Seattle economy, and some of the immediate economic benefits its second home would experience — including $5 billion in construction spending.
It asked candidates to include in their bids a variety of detailed information, including potential building sites, crime and traffic stats and nearby recreational opportunities. Amazon also asked cities and states to describe the tax incentives available to offset its costs for building and operating its second headquarters. The most eye-popping of those offers was New Jersey’s promise of up to $7 billion in tax incentives to bring Amazon to Newark.
Another tech giant, Apple, this week said it, too, was hunting for a location to build a major new campus. But the company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, said it would not conduct a public bidding process akin to Amazon’s. He said California and Texas were unlikely locations for the new campus because Apple already has significant operations there.
Amazon’s search process has also attracted critics. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization that serves as an advocate for local businesses, said that politicians were enhancing Amazon’s image just as the company’s market power was under growing scrutiny from groups like her own.
“As these cities woo and grovel, they are basically communicating this idea that we should want Amazon to be bigger and more powerful in our economy,” Ms. Mitchell said.
Ed Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard who studies cities, predicted that the winner of the contest would have in place the kind of positive economic attributes that mean it wouldn’t necessarily need Amazon to thrive.
“At its best, the competition for Amazon has spurred cities to think about how to improve their quality of life more generally,” he said. “At its worst, the competition has become a distraction and a contest for throwing cash at the giant.”

To dozens of cities across the United States, Amazon’s widely publicized search for a “second headquarters” looked like thousands of new jobs, up for grabs. To Pivot co-host Scott Galloway, it now looks like a “ruse.”
“I lease office space all the time for my businesses and I always tell my real estate agent, ‘We can lease any office in the world as long as I can walk there from where I live,’” Galloway said on the latest episode. “Amazon is now talking about having three headquarters, Seattle, Crystal City and Long Island City. The Bezos’s also own three homes, and the average distance from those three homes to a headquarters is 6.4 miles.
“This was never a contest,” he added. “It was a con meant to induce ridiculous terms that they then took to the cites all along that they knew they were going to be in.”
In other words: By soliciting bids from lots of place where it was never going to move, Galloway alleges, Amazon was probably able to get more tax breaks from the pre-determined “winners.”
“I would bet, Kara, that when they pick two cities and they went to 2 and 3, they didn’t say, ‘Well, only half our headquarters is going there, so we’re going to let you cut the tax subsidies and incentives in half,’” he explained. “This just has ill will written all over it, and I think people started to figure out what was going on ... It’s the Olympics on steroids. A lot of high fives and ribbon cutting, and then 10 years later, we realize it was a bad idea.”
You can listen to Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway wherever you get your podcasts — including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.
Below, we’ve shared a full transcript of Kara and Scott’s latest episode.
Kara Swisher: Hi everyone, this is Pivot from the Vox Media Podcast Network. I’m Kara Swisher.
Scott Galloway: And I’m Scott Galloway, future ambassador to Estonia after delivering southern Florida to President Beto O’Rourke in 2020.
Oh, Beto. I’m so sad for you, Scott, that you didn’t get your Beto as senator from Texas.
Yeah, gets 49 percent in Texas, raises money on a national level. Hello, Mr. President. But more importantly, Kara, key question: A few days in, how are you feeling about the election?
Well, it’s a complicated topic and I have a lot of feelings. I have many feelings, I’m full of feelings about the election. I’m going to say how my son felt. So we get in the car and my son ... he wasn’t with me. I was at an election party last night, and he woke up, he was reviewing all the things with me. He is 13 years old and he goes, “I got to say, eh.” And that’s what he said. “Eh.” He goes, “Democrats really can’t deliver it, but the Republicans kinda suck too.” And I was like, “And: scene.” That is exactly what the situation is. So, eh. Yeah.
So you’re not terribly upset, not terribly happy. Just sort of meh.
Yeah. We just can’t have nice things, as they say. We just can’t have nice things in this country. So that’s the way it is. It’s fine. You know what? Gridlock is good. As far as I ... In this situation, I’m good with gridlock, so it’s fine. That’s what we got. That’s what we’re getting. I’m going to live with that. Gridlock is good. So, anyway!
Bring it down to tech. Do you think this means anything in terms of the tech sector?
No, no. I think they’re not going to get regulated now because “gridlock is good.” You know what I mean? I think there won’t be any moves, any serious moves, unless they can all agree that tech, that may agree on the bipartisanship that technology companies need to be regulated. Maybe that will happen.
I think you’re gonna see a lot of that from the states, like Gavin Newsom in California and some other states. You’re going to see action that sort of makes the tech companies come to heel a little bit. On the national level, I’m not so sure. I’m just going to have to find out. But Pelosi certainly is behind it, it’s just a question whether she can get the Senate to do the same. So we’ll see. We’ll see if we’re going to have a privacy bill or anything else. Probably not. Gridlock is the way, is the name of the game.
Let’s talk about big stories that are going on. Obviously, you had a good prediction last week about Amazon being in the Virginia, the Washington, D.C., area. And, in fact, there were some leaks that it was looking at Crystal City, Virginia, Dallas, and New York City. Actually Long Island City in New York. Tell me what you think about this.
I refer to this not as a contest but a con. I think it may have blown up in Amazon’s face. We’ll see.
Because?
Time will tell, but imagine you’re the wealthiest man in the world and you get to pick, or you have more options than anyone in the world, and you’ve decided, “Okay ...” So, I’ll personalize this. I lease office space all the time for my businesses and I always tell my real estate agent, “We can lease any office in the world as long as I can walk there from where I live.”
That is the exact same instruction that Jeff Bezos gave to this ridiculous con, this ruse. Because if you look at... Amazon is now talking about having three headquarters, Seattle, Crystal City and Long Island City. The Bezos’ also own three homes, and the average distance from those three homes to a headquarters is 6.4 miles, so this was never a contest. It was a con meant to induce ridiculous terms that they then took to the cites all along that they knew they were going to be in.
Also, the whole HQ2 and 3 is also a bit of a con and bad faith. It’s like if you’ve ever been to your kid’s charity school auction and there’s a frenzy for bidding on dinner with the headmaster and someone bids $9,000 and someone bids $10,000 and then they decide right then, well, we’re going to do two dinners. Thank you for the $19,000. Because I would bet, Kara, that when they pick two cities and they went to 2 and 3, they didn’t say, “Well, only half our headquarters is going there, so we’re going to let you cut the tax subsidies and incentives and half.”
This just has ill will written all over it, and I think people started to figure out what was going on. So what did they do? They’re like, “Oh, the con is up. They figured out this wasn’t a contest and we’ve abused the Commonwealth and wasted resources and time of municipal officials. What do we do?” Announce it into the busiest news cycle of the year. No accident that they announced it last night.
Right? Well, here we are. Here we are. What’s really interesting is having a second headquarters. I don’t quite know what that means. I’ve heard rumors of Apple having a second headquarters, etc. I’m not sure what the point of a second headquarters is.
Money. Give us money. It’s a handout. Sticking your hand out.
Yeah, but why?
Second headquarters ...
Just call it a headquarters and make it an office? It was an office, they’re just going to call it... ?
Yeah, but if you call it a headquarters you get everyone whipped up and every elected official wants to be the person to detonate a prosperity bomb in their Times Square, so they’re willing to write big checks. So it’s branding.
So, it’s a new stadium.
Yeah, that’s right. It’s the Olympics on steroids. A lot of high fives and ribbon cutting, and then 10 years later, we realize it was a bad idea.
Right. Well, we’ll see. I mean, it’ll be interesting. It does seem to have gotten flat. The balloon has gotten flat here on this Amazon headquarters. I’ve always thought it was a ridiculous circus.
You don’t think it’s going to be a big deal. You just kinda, it’s kinda come and gone.
No, I said that. On CNBC they were to covering it like, oh, breathlessly. And I said, “I hope you’re enjoying this circus.” They’re like, “What do you think?” I’m like, “Not much. I don’t think much of it at all.” I don’t think about it, really. I don’t think it is that big a deal. I don’t think it’s that ... I don’t know, analog places, that whole game is lost on me in every way, but I can see why the TV or whatever breathlessly covers it. It’s just kind of silly and it doesn’t help the ...
What I really am interested in is how companies that are in the cities, like right now in San Francisco with Prop C, how the businesses helped the cities and how they take up their civic responsibility, because I think especially tech businesses really haven’t picked up, in terms of what they need to, the responsibility of being a civic citizen of any city they’re in. That’s my focus, really. When are they going to actually behave the way banks did years ago and give money to the opera or give money to music or kids, whatever, programs and things like that. So that’s what I’m looking for.
And you don’t think, on average, they’re good citizens?
I think Marc Benioff has been, you know what I mean? But I don’t, no. I think they operate in their little areas and they have lovely kombucha shakes up on the 10th floor and looking down and they don’t participate in the city at large, and they drive up rents and I don’t think ... I think there’s a reason people, for example .... San Francisco, come to San Francisco and see where everything is headed, if you want to see the future. You can see haves and have-nots, filthy streets, not a lot of civic engagement by the tech community, which is the biggest employer in San Francisco. So you’ll see, you’ll see the future as far as I’m concerned.
We’ll see if we can clean it up, but it’s up to now the city officials to clean it up and figure out a way, and most of tech didn’t like the idea of Prop C for lots of reasons. Some of them good, where does the money go? But in general, it’s not a feeling that they ... even if they’re of the city, they’re not of the city. So I think companies have to start acting like they belong to a community. Thank you very much.
Do you think they’re going to do that on their own, or we just going to do ...
I approve this ad for Kara Swisher for mayor. What? I’m sorry.
I’m in. I’m right behind Beto. Do you think it’s fair or realistic to expect they’re going to do it, or we need to elect people that have the backbone to hold these companies accountable?
To make them do it. They should do it. They should do it, but you know, whatever their ... we have to make them. That’s all. We just have to make them. Yes, exactly. And not roll over for them and give them these perks and things like that. It’s just a ridiculous game.
To your point ...
It should be a privilege for these companies to be in San Francisco.
Yeah, I agree.
Not a tax break.
Most beautiful city in the union. I spent 10 years there, but I don’t go back a lot.
Not anymore. Don’t go back.
When I go there, the impression I get in the way ... I would describe my experience there as, I went to go meet with an individual who runs one of these tech companies who’s early 30s, a billionaire, and going into the office this thing I noticed was the number of severely mentally ill homeless people on the street below that building. I thought, “We really have become a dystopia.” I mean, it is just a contrast.
It’s changed a lot in the past two years.
It’s rattling. I mean, really rattling.
It is. It’s rattling. And so we have to do something about that, and companies should be a part of the civic fabric of a society and they have to move in and they should do it on their own, but you know, we’ll make them. We’ll have to make them. That’s all.
Yeah.
Let me finish this other big story.
Go ahead.
The divided Congress, what do you think that divided Congress means?
So, I think there’s this fissure on a bigger level, and I think of how it translates to business, and that is: We now have about 70 percent of the Senate is elected by about 30 percent of the populace. A lot of these red states don’t have big populations, either they lost population or they just get two senators regardless of the fact that Wyoming has a population that’s smaller than most congressional districts, but at the same time, over the last 10 years, if you look at who’s accreted the majority of the income gains, they tend to be people into the cities with college educations, which is Latin for progressives.
So you have the economic power or the people capturing the income gains are progressive and yet you have the political power going to the red states. So what I think you’re going to see, Kara, over the next several years is kind of this “woke as a business strategy.” Similar to what Nike did with Colin Kaepernick or Dick’s getting rid of assault rifles. I think that a lot of companies are going to decide to try and be overtly political and appeal to progressives who don’t feel represented politically, but quite frankly have all the money. So you’re going to see increasing political viewpoints.
Yeah, like Nike, Patagonia.
Exactly. Starbucks. Companies are going to come out and say, “Hey, progressives, we’re your company.” It might be a principled thing to do.
Because you have the money.
It might be generally how they feel, but it’s also a shareholder-driven thing to do.
Yeah. That’s interesting, because you have the money. That’s interesting. What Land O’Lakes did with that awful person. I can’t even say his name. He won. I can’t believe it.
You’re going to see a lot of that.
I’m not going to speak ... Whatever. Really? Oh, God. I’m glad Land O’Lakes did that. All right, Scott, what’s up? What’s next?
Let’s try something out. The midterms are over, but can we come up with an assessment of how fake news ... How did social media do? Were we influenced? What happened here? What’s your view?
Well, it’s interesting. I was just talking about this with ... I was talking to WNYC in New York about this. I think that they’re trying. They’re starting to clean it up, obviously. They keep announcing how many, like I took off 30 accounts, whatever. This is a cockroach problem, right? This is going to be an ongoing problem. It’s not going to be suddenly just cleaned up, and so I think what we’ve got to do is as these stories die down, like the Russia story, whatever, we’ve got to really hold these companies’ feet to the fire on persistently making it a cleaner and cleaner place.
It reminds me, I was trying to think of an analogy, but it’s like they’re chemical companies that are dumping stuff into the river, they got to clean it up now, and they got to figure out a way. Now, look, there’s been some damage. There’s been some poisonings, but they’ve got to clean it up now and figure out a way to do what they do and grow how they want to grow without continually doing this.
So every time they make an announcement, they call me, I don’t care. I was like, “This should be your job.” It’s like saying the New York Times should spell the word “and” right. I just, I feel like we’ve got to make it their jobs and make sure they realize that that’s what they need to do.
So let’s move to the how, and I want to propose an idea, and you tell me why it would or wouldn’t work. I’m fascinated with this concept of identity. I’m in Los Angeles right now, and everyone is just so friendly in the Starbucks line, then in the moment there’s a little bit of anonymity, and you’re in your car, there’s road rage everywhere. Then take that times 10 when you can invent a fake identity or 100 of them on Twitter or YouTube, and there’s not only a lack of civility, there’s people willing to engage in things that are unthinkable and damaging to the fabric of our society. Why wouldn’t we demand or legislate that when people go online in ... on formats that have shown themselves to be very powerful, influence elections, suppress voter turnout, that you have to have an identity and be who you say you are?
Yeah. Yeah. I think that’s critical. I think being anonymous makes sense in some cases. In some countries, that’s the problem, and in being able to protect yourself in countries that are autocratic. So I think it’s a big question, but in other countries, it’s not the case. I always think that being anonymous ...
And these bots, it just drives me crazy that they haven’t been able to handle these bots, these bots gin up trouble and then humans get involved with them. To me, the bottom, the lowest bar is going to be get rid of bots and to make a lot of this advertising transparent. It starts with that, and then get rid of fake accounts, get rid of fake accounts and make sure everybody who has an account is a person, whether it’s a good person or not, that’s what’s going to be harder to decide. But, make sure they are actually a person. I think that’s what ... I’ve always thought anonymous was always a problem anywhere you go, because people act badly.
I’ve heard smart internet analysts say that if any sort of identity mandate was actually put in place that Twitter would basically go out of business. That you have something between a third and two-thirds of all Twitter traffic that they advertise to justify their entire ad business or their ad model would literally just go away. That two-thirds of it is bot-driven and noise.
Yup, yup, yup. That’s the problem. They don’t want to show exactly how unpopular they actually are. You know what I mean? I think that’s with a lot of things.
Again, these companies would be better off creating a better service. I don’t get why they want to have a shitty experience for people. That’s the problem, because some of it’s so wonderful. I mean, I’ve had such a nice, interesting time on Twitter with this election, reading people, having opinions. It has a goodness to it that always gets superseded by the badness. To me, it’s really ... it should be a business problem, that they should recognize that.
Yeah. I’m going to put on my tinfoil hat and come across as a conspiracy theorist, but I write a lot about politics and I’ve been very critical in certain instances about the GRU in Russia. And whenever I’m critical about Russian activity I immediately get comments saying, “Scott, love your stuff, but you got to get off the Russia bandwagon.” I started noticing that same sentence structure, same theme across different areas where I post my content from different sources and different identities.
Now, I genuinely believe that if I were an economy 1/15th the size of the U.S. and I wanted to wreak havoc or promote my agenda, I would identify a thousand people of influence, or in my case, a million people of influence and set these troll farms loose on them.
I now believe that there are bots or bad actors going after almost anyone in responding and putting up content and they’re not who they say they are. Does that sound ... am I paranoid? And which doesn’t necessarily mean I’m wrong, but do you think this is happening?
No, I think ... yes. I mean yes. Broadly, yes. These are well-orchestrated campaigns by different people. And the thing that you have to realize is they don’t care what side they’re on, right? That’s the thing. They’ll go after Samantha Bee, they’ll go after Roseanne Barr, they’ll go after ...
What I think is gonna happen is when they start going after — and they are starting to do this — companies and affecting, like, Disney. That’s happened already to Nvidia and it’s happened. Like, when they start to really, especially with video manipulation and things like that, you ain’t seen nothing yet. It’s not going to be a tweet. It’s going to be serious manipulation of video, of other kinds of things, and I think we’re just at the beginning of that for sure.
But you know, it’s going to be a “great” future for us, Scott. That’s where it’s going. I’m in a down mood today on the internets because I think they haven’t...
I was wondering how you were doing. I was trying to think of something to cheer you up and I couldn’t think of anything. I’m in LA-.
You know what? Scott Walker lost. I’m good with that. I feel good about that. It would have been nice to see Ted Cruz go down.
Dana Rohrabacher lost.
Yeah. Oh yeah. Did that Devin Nunes go or is he still there to drive us crazy?
I don’t think so. I think he’s in a district, I think he represents his district pretty well, actually, but the honest answer is I don’t know what happened.
Well, good. He’s not head of the committee anymore. Goodbye, Devin. He’s the worst. He’s the person who uses tech for bad. There’s someone I would really like to ... Well, maybe I’ll interview him and let’s see how that goes.
Anyway, last thing, we have predictions, but we’re going to contextualize it, too. So we always end the show on a prediction. Give us a prediction. Let’s just do a prediction. You have one. Correct? You have one to bring to us? Because you were good on the headquarters. You’ve been good on a couple of predictions. Casper has still not been sold, but otherwise you’ve been pretty good on it.
Oh, that hurts. Casper absolutely will be sold.
I think you’re right.
Okay. So this is more macro, but I think the consumer world is going to distill to a small number of what I call recurring revenue bundles, and similar to what Amazon has done with Prime, you’re going to see some kind of mega brands, a Nike or a Walmart, decide, “Okay, I’m in charge of all of your, not only your shoes, but your fitness and maybe even your healthcare.” You can get a knee replacement from a Nike-endorsed orthopedic surgeon. You could stay at a hotel that figures out a way to get you breakfast that’s not terribly unhealthy for you, that has a gym that is Nike-approved and ...
Where did you come up with this scheme?
This is what I do. This is how I fake making a living.
I just called it a “scheme.” That wasn’t really nice, but it is a scheme. Where did you come up with this?
Well, I think, as I said, I smoke a lot of pot, so that helps. And I have an MBA, so that’s kind of the master cocktail for ridiculous business ideas that people will pay you a lot of money to hear. I’m pretty sure we’re going to edit that out, what I just said, I’m pretty sure we’re gonna edit that out.
So you would pick ...
No, but I think recurring revenue bundles are going to be the next big thing.
Recurring revenue bundles.
If you look at a company that makes more than $10 billion or $20 billion or creates more than $10 billion or $20 billion in market value over a 12-month period, you’re going to ... It’s going to be an equivalent or a mimic of what Prime is to Amazon. Some of these things.
Like you’re an Apple person or you’re a this person? I don’t...
100 percent, but it might go places you might not think. Apple might say, “We have a watch picking up on your health patterns. Kara, you would love Lululemon ...”
Yeah, I’m not doing that, Scott.
And we’re going to do a relationship with Lululemon and you’re going to let us know where you are and going to deliver stuff to you and make your life easier around health and fitness.
No. I’m going to say no to this. I’m going to give you a big fat no on this. I don’t think they’re going to get into...
You don’t buy it?
I don’t buy it. I don’t buy it in any way. I don’t think Apple has any, I don’t think they have any expertise to do this, and I don’t think they have any interest in doing it, so I don’t think they will. I think they’re going to sell you a phone. That’s what they’re going to do, and people are going to stick to their knitting, as I like to say.
They’ve all got to get into recurrent ... And by the way, the phone, I mean ...
You may want them to, but they’re not going to do that. Apple’s not going to get me Lululemon. By the way, my son wears Lululemon. FYI. He likes their shorts.
Every company — this is the key — every company has to engage in monogamous relationships. Right now they’re dating, which is expensive and hard. They have to enter to monogamous relationships with consumers.
Somehow you enter ... really? They can’t be promiscuous? Crazy.
That’s 100 percent. Think about what’s happened with airlines where it’s all distilled down to a small number of networks. So I’m flying Air France. It’s an inferior airline, but I am in this monogamous relationship with Sky Team because I’ve fallen in love with Delta because I fly Delta a lot, so now I do this stupid ... I’m in this relationship with Sky Team that I can’t get out of, and that’s what’s going to happen. It’s going to be a series of four or five small networks, one for your media, one for your apparel, one for your travel, one for your health, and it’s going to be a race to see what brand can be that, bring you that bundle.
I think this is ridonkulous, Scott. It’ll just be Amazon.
Ridonkulous?! You’re hanging out with your teenage boys too much. Ridonkulous!
Amazon’s just a store! Yes. No he’s not, he’s very smart.
That’s a good one. So my prediction, a bold prediction around recurring revenue bundles ...
Is ridonkulous. I think Amazon is it.
And your prediction is I’m wrong.
Because Google could have done it. That’s ridiculous. Google could have done ... any of these companies did. I don’t want a relationship with Google when I’m getting my lunch, or Nike. I want shoes from Nike. I don’t want my lunch from Nike. “Ah, my Nike lunch has arrived. It’s delicious. It involves carrots.”
You wouldn’t want, say, you wouldn’t want Emirates to plan all your travel. You wouldn’t want ...
No. I wouldn’t want Emirates, because you know what? Since I’ve been insulting the Saudis and everybody else so much for their dirty money, I think I would not want to fly on their airline because I think I’d be flown somewhere ...
Would you want Amazon to give you and your family your health insurance?
No. No. I’ll tell you, here’s where I do like, here’s where your ridonkulous idea does work. Say you’re Airbnb. I do trust them on Experiences. They can do adjacent things, hotels and airlines. I could see that relationship becoming a little more serious. I would trust them because I trust them on their Airbnb home, so I could see that, if it’s adjacent. If it’s adjacent, Scott, I would do it. Otherwise, no thank you.
Yeah. So Airbnb is absolutely one of them. Airbnb could move into all sorts of travel and just kinda take it off the table.
If Airbnb suddenly wants to buy me shoes? No, thank you. That’s all I’m saying.
Yeah. But think about how many places that could go. Airbnb, it’s either gonna be Airbnb or Expedia or another ... the Four Seasons is another kind of brand that could probably come up with a recurring revenue bundle.
Yeah, the Four Seasons. Is that where you stay, Scott? Is that where you stay, is the Four Seasons?
Well, this is an interesting point.
Do you know what Four Seasons is?
The Four Seasons ...
Or are you stuck to going there?
The Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton, I used to always stay at those two brands. One, because they do a decent job, and two, whenever I travel someone else is paying, usually. But I’ve stopped staying at these brands, and it represents kind of the end of the brand era because I no longer need to defer to the shorthand of the brand and I can go on my social graph or these weapons of diligence, TripAdvisor [and] Google. I can find out that the Waldorf, an aging brand that I would never associate with in LA, is actually the cool new hotel, and that’s where I’ll stay.
So you’re seeing, at least in travel, kind of new and innovative is the bomb, and brand is declining importance, so kind of the sun has passed midday on brand.
Interesting, interesting. You know what Four Seasons is? Holiday Inn for rich people, because they’re all the same anywhere you go. Thank you. That was my thought on Four Seasons.
Actually, I don’t know. There’s huge variance in how the Four Seasons in Austin or Chicago, pretty weak. The Four Seasons in Toronto or in Budapest?
Right, Scott, I’m enjoying your hotel recommendations right now. Speaking of which ...
I love hotels. I travel to hotels, not to cities.
San Francisco, there’s strikes going on because of robots delivering food, and one of the reasons ... anyway.
Although, speaking of robots, I just rented a car from Hertz and I’m rethinking that in fact Uber may be worth $120 billion and we should replace every individual with the robots. Have you rented a car recently?
Yes. I do it all the time.
I think it’s an awful experience. I had a terrible experience at Hertz.
You’re right. It’s an awful experience. It is. You’re right. That’s a very good thing that needs to be developing, but we’re gonna discuss that another week, because I have things to do. I’ve got to go watch the Trump press conference right now.
You do. What’s on the slate for Kara? What is the most interesting thing you’re doing this week?
This week?
I’m going to be interviewing Marc Benioff, but I can’t tell you for who or why. It’s a big interview. It’s gonna be on TV.
Wow, and you’re a big fan of Marc’s.
So, Marc Benioff. Yes, I am. It’s gonna be at the top of Salesforce tower. That’s all I’m gonna say. I’m going to try to helicopter in and then jump from the helicopter, take a rope down the building and then crash through the window and then start the interview. What do you think?
Better yet? I think he should build like a terrace and you should go have like a Mussolini speech.
Yeah, something like that.
Just address the entire city.
Something along those lines. Anything for audience. Anyway, Scott, I’ve got things to do.
Good stuff, Kara. Have a good rest of the week.
All right, thanks. Looking forward to talking next week.

The news of the lucky winners—New York and Virginia—exposes the bad faith of Amazon’s much-hyped search.
Those bids didn’t just include the size of the bribe. they included a wealth of important data about plans for transportation, housing, education and workforce development. Amazon now has a treasure trove of non-public information about America’s future.
UPDATE: Amazon has formally announced that it will locate two new corporate outposts, which it is referring to as its “headquarters,” in Long Island City, New York and the Crystal City section of Arlington, Virginia (which it has arbitrarily decided to call “National Landing”). The details of the arrangements are as bad as expected.
Amazon is set to receive well over $1.5 billion, for the Long Island City facility. That includes $48,000 per job created through New York State's Excelsior Program and a $325 million cash grant from Empire State Development for occupying office space. Amazon also stands to receive up to nearly $1 billion from New York City's Relocation and Employment Assistance Program (REAP), in addition to other as-of-right incentives from New York City's Industrial and Commercial Abatement Program (ICAP), a Payment In Lieu Of Tax (PILOT) program where the city substitutes its funding for Amazon's property taxes. State Senator Mike Gianaris and New York City Council member Jimmy Van Bramer, who represent the area, put the expected total at $3 billion. “We are witness to a cynical game in which Amazon duped New York into offering unprecedented amounts to one of the wealthiest companies on Earth,” they said in a statement.
The Virginia site could yield Amazon another $573 million in subsidies, and an additional $200 million if they expand, according to the memorandum of understanding. This money comes in a cash grant of $22,000 per job, and a portion of the growth from hotel taxes in the city of Arlington. Under the contract, Amazon got a commitment from the state for “regulatory flexibility” that will lighten regulations on the company. Amazon also retains the right to seek a protective order if any entity seeks more information about the deal.
In all, this is a multibillion-dollar haul to place offices in two locations where Amazon already had a presence and would have to expand into if it wanted to maintain status as a global company. It's a fleecing of billions of dollars that could have been put toward improving quality of life in these areas, attracting companies to the desirable locations. Instead, New York and Virginia handed over a bribe.
Over the past year, mayors and governors nationwide have fallen over themselves to offer cash bribes to Amazon to court its second headquarters, billed as a “full equal” to its Seattle home base. Two hundred and thirty-eight cities submitted bids to attract HQ2, as it was quaintly known, stuffed with billions of dollars in government subsidies and detailed plans for how to accommodate Amazon employees’ housing and transportation needs. Some of these bids were borderline absurd: Chicago offered Amazon the income tax receipts from its own staff.
Practically every other multinational corporation in the world opens branch offices in other cities without fanfare. Google’s offices in Berlin, London and New York are not considered second or third headquarters – they’re just regional offices. Google is reportedly expanding its New York footprint, in fact.
HQ2 was supposed to bring 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment to the lucky winner. But then the New York Times broke the story this week that Amazon will place offices in Crystal City, Virginia—home of the Pentagon—and Long Island City, New York. That means the promised jobs and investment will be cut in half. Will the subsidy packages be halved as well? We have no idea, because the HQ2 bids from Virginia and New York City are officially a secret.
If it was impossible for one company to have two headquarters, it’s really impossible to have three. These are just regional offices. In fact, they’re extensions of the offices Amazon already have in the New York and Washington metro areas. The two cities have the tech-savvy workforce, transportation hubs, and education pipelines Amazon asked for in its solicitations.
They are also critical to Amazon’s not-at-all-secret quest for world domination. Amazon thrives on government contracts and close collaborations with defense and intelligence operations, so D.C. is a natural fit. It’s also where Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos just bought a giant mansion in which to hold salons, and the local newspaper. Bezos also has a home in New York, which is the center of the corporate universe, home to the head offices of Amazon suppliers and partners, as well as the nation’s advertising mecca, a field that Amazon has been aggressively pushing into lately.
Cities of the stature of New York or Washington have been pulling away from the rest of the country economically for years. Of course Amazon would need to have personnel there. Amazon knew that creating the pretense of a bidding war would pressure major cities to offer lavish packages, running up the payouts the company could extract. But we should raise the question: Why would any politician give away ten cents in subsidies to bring in a company that they know will set up shop anyway?
That’s a question Amazon has been able to hold off for years. Since 2000, Amazon has been awarded subsidy deals worth at least $1.6 billion for data centers and warehouses, as it promises rapid shipping everywhere and constantly expands its cloud computing service. This number has been accelerating over time as Amazon has grown and made more promises. $230 million has come in just in 2018. Amazon just announced its 14th warehouse in the Inland Empire of California alone.
As Prime shipping goes from two-day guarantees to one-day to a matter of hours, Amazon will need to store inventory in every corner of the country. Yet it continues the lucrative ploy of getting cities desperate for jobs to vie with one another for infrastructure Amazon has to build anyway. Public officials continue to back up the truck for the world’s richest man and his company, for no discernible reason.
But the biggest suckers on HQ2 aren’t New York and Virginia. it’s the other 236 cities that bid on a headquarters they were never going to get. Those bids didn’t just include the size of the bribe. they included a wealth of important data about plans for transportation, housing, education and workforce development. Amazon now has a treasure trove of non-public information about America’s future, in addition to knowing how much cash cities are willing to part with to land an Amazon facility. And it got all that, along with a giant PR benefit from the bidding war, for free.
If you knew a city was going to build a road in a particular place, you could make a lot of money buying up the real estate there. Imagine that on a national scale and you can see how Amazon will grow far wealthier from the data it collected than even the raw dollars extracted from HQ2’s big winners. In fact, this was the real reason Amazon orchestrated the whole charade.
Amazon can now go back to every city that put in a bid and offer a warehouse or data center or satellite office for one of its 16 subsidiary companies. The company will have significant leverage in those negotiations, because the other side has already made an initial offer. Just as important, Amazon can set up operations with the foreknowledge of what cities have divulged to them. It can build its convenience stores or bookseller outlets where cities have planned rapid development and population growth. It can locate its warehouses where a new highway expansion is imminent. It can shift knowledge jobs to areas where universities will soon be built and high-tech education projects funded.
It can even potentially sell this data to other companies who long for similar deals, or at least start up a new business line in negotiating deals between companies and municipal governments.
Monetizing of this new data trove will yield untold billions of dollars in value. It will also embed Amazon deeper and deeper into American life, committing politicians at the state and federal level to become human shields for the company. For example, no senator from New York or Virginia, with Amazon in its backyard, will want to speak too loudly about Amazon’s monopoly attempts. And no mayor or city council member, eager to secure that next warehouse, will have much to say either.
We already know that Amazon runs on data—from its customers, its suppliers, its cloud computing clients—to increase its power. It can anticipate what shoppers want from the purchasing history. It can see what third-party products are selling on the site, and replicate them. Now it can make money off of knowledge about the future of cities. There was no reason for elected officials to fall for this game. But they have been lured by the promise of jobs—in many cases a false promise, as studies show that corporate welfare subsidies are usually not worth it—into handing a goldmine over to Amazon.

Washington (CNN Business)Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won't take office until January, but the progressive firebrand is already casting herself as the voice of the people in the debate over Amazon's arrival in New York, even as fellow Democrats rushed to welcome the company.
""Amazon is a billion-dollar company,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter late Monday. ""The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.""
Amazon formally announced its choice Tuesday morning, naming New York and a location just outside of Washington, DC, to share its 50,000-employee second headquarters.
The announcement included welcoming comments from New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who joked to reporters earlier this month that he would change his name to ""Amazon Cuomo, if that's what it takes"" to lure the tech behemoth.
""Today, with Amazon committing to expand its headquarters in Long Island City, New York can proudly say that we have attracted one of the largest, most competitive economic development investments in US history,"" Cuomo said in his statement.
New York State will grant $1.525 billion in incentives contingent on the company creating 25,000 new jobs with an average salary of $150,000 and occupying a certain amount of office space.
De Blasio at a press conference Tuesday promised that Amazon's presence in Long Island City would benefit low-income New Yorkers, including residents of the nearby Queensbridge Houses, the largest public-housing development in the US.
""I can tell you right here baked into the deal are a lot of great specific efforts to help the residents of Queensbridge -- training, job opportunities,"" the mayor said. ""One of the biggest companies on earth next to the biggest public housing development in the United States. The synergy is going to be extraordinary.""
Under the terms of the deal, Amazon committed to hosting job fairs and resume workshops for public-housing tenants for three years starting in 2020 and subsequently will ""collaborate in good faith"" on additional measures. The company will also invest in city technology training programs aimed at residents of public housing.
Ocasio-Cortez joined a skeptical chorus that already includes state senator Michael Gianaris and Queens City Council Member Jimmy van Bramer, who have voiced their opposition to any tax breaks for Amazon.
On Tuesday, New York state assemblyman Ron Kim said he plans to introduce a bill to block Amazon's deal with New York and redirect subsidies to reduce student debt.
Local and state politicians may have more political power to push back against those incentives following last week's elections, in which New York Democrats took back the state senate.
From her perch as the surrounding area's representative in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez has little authority over the deal. But her tweets Monday and Tuesday on the deal showed her power as a progressive darling to rally local activists and officials to influence how the deal is implemented — including holding Amazon accountable.
In the rest of her tweet thread, Ocasio-Cortez outlined demands that commonly are featured in community benefits agreements negotiated between developers and local residents, such as well-paid jobs, protections for unions and investments in neighborhood infrastructure. Long Island City has undergone a blistering pace of high-end apartment construction in recent years, sending housing prices soaring.
""Displacement is not community development. Investing in luxury condos is not the same thing as investing in people and families,"" she wrote. ""Shuffling working class people out of a community does not improve their quality of life.""
In its announcement, Amazon said it would build space for a tech incubator and a new public school in Long Island City. Through a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes agreement, the company will invest in neighborhood infrastructure improvements and green spaces. It did not mention provisions for affordable housing.
A spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately return a request for comment. The congresswoman-elect on Tuesday morning was leading a sit-in with climate change protesters at the Capitol in Washington.

Mr Greaves pleaded no contest to the charge against him
A US man who wrote a guidebook giving advice to paedophiles has been sentenced to two years' probation.
Phillip Greaves pleaded no contest on Wednesday in Florida to a charge of distributing obscene material depicting minors engaged in harmful conduct.
Greaves will serve the sentence in Colorado, his home state, and will not have to register as a sex offender.
He was arrested in December after he sold a copy of the self-published book to an undercover detective in Florida.
He was arrested in Colorado on behalf of prosecutors in Polk County, Florida, and was extradited to the southern US state.
The book, The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: a Child-lover's Code of Conduct, argues that paedophiles are misunderstood and purports to offer advice to help them abide by the law.
Mr Greaves gained notoriety after online retailer Amazon.com was criticised for selling the book on its website.

NORFOLK, Va., Nov. 13 (UPI) -- A U.S. animal-rights group has written Amazon.com chief Jeff Bezos, urging him to remove books on dog and cockfighting from the online store.

Every weekend, in a relatively quiet and quaint part of Los Angeles, you can find cheap kitchenware on sale. There are car parts, tools, blankets, and more, usually at bargain prices. There are also $5-10 counterfeit DVDs and cheap music CDs on sale. Usually cops patrol this now-crowded area, with sellers always on the lookout. They have to be quick. If not, their items are picked up and thrown into the back of a police car.
Piracy is everywhere. In the streets, in the back of a warehouse, online, and in more places. But try this on for size. According to a new Wall Street Journal report, they’re also available on top online seller Amazon.com. Here’s what they wrote:
“In the latest challenge for the battered music industry, pirates are flooding Amazon.com Inc. and other online retailers with counterfeit CDs that often cost nearly as much as the official versions and increasingly are difficult to distinguish from the real goods.”
An unnamed record company told WSJ’s Hannah Karp that direct-to-consumer CDs were flat. Amazon account sales are down over 17% due to counterfeit CDs.
How exactly does this work? The American Association of Independent Music notified their indie-label members that Chinese pirates are flooding Amazon with counterfeit CDs. The pirates sell the CDs at just slightly less than their real counterparts. Amazon doesn’t have a clear-cut way to verify these CDs, as pirates start selling the counterfeit items “within about two weeks of an album’s release date.” Amazon even lists these products in their “buy box.”
The RIAA launched an investigation in August to determine how big this problem truly is. They placed 194 CD orders based on top search results for each album type. 44 CDs were counterfeit. That’s approximately 1 in 4. What’s worse is that Amazon fulfilled 18 counterfeit CDs, and not individual sellers.
The counterfeit products on Amazon were traced back to a CD manufacturing plant in China, according to a letter written to the U.S. trade representative. The letter stated,
“The artwork, packaging and inserts are carefully copied in fine detail. The untrained eye would not even be able to identify them as counterfeits.”
Russian counterfeits pay the same attention to detail on the exterior packaging but is “sloppy” in the interior, however, according to the same letter.
Brad Buckles told WSJ,
“Amazon should not be playing host to illegal items that would normally be found on the black market.”
The study shocked Amazon. A company spokeswoman said that Amazon has “zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits,” and
“[is] working closely with labels and distributors to identify offenders, and remove fraudulent items from our catalog. We are also taking action and aggressively pursuing bad actor.”"ÿÿAn RIAA Study Shows That Amazon is Guilty of Selling Counterfeit CDs

Chinese Government Planning to Tighten Intellectual Property Regulation of Apple, Amazon, and Taobao
By ALEX HSU
China’s National Copyright Administration will execute an initiative to more strictly supervise Apple, Amazon, and Taobao as part of an inter-department campaign against internet piracy called “Sword Network.” The campaign will begin in July.
The NCAC will require that the three companies report on measures being taken against piracy. The NCAC has already required Amazon to close 36 third party distributors based on complaints that the distributors were selling pirated books, said Yu Cike, Copyright Management Director at the NCAC, on June 26.
According to a different source from the NCAC, the NCAC started pressuring Apple to take responsibility for piracy issues in December 2012 after Apple appealed a Beijing court ruling requiring Apple to pay a publishing agency RMB 520,000 (USD 84,645) for copyright violations.
You Yunting, a Chinese lawyer specializing in intellectual property, told BrightWire that Apple, Amazon, and Taobao may react differently to the NCAC’s request. “The Kindle Store is partnering with Chineseall.com in China. Because Chineseall.com is backed by several former copyright department officials, the Kindle store may have no issue following the NCAC’s requests. Similarly, Taobao may not have any issues with the requests.”
“Apple will be in an awkward position,” You said. “If Apple starts reporting to the NCAC, it will equate to acknowledging the agency’s jurisdiction over Apple. If Apple refuses to comply with the NCAC’s request, Apple could face a lot of pressure from the Chinese government.”"ÿÿChinese Government Planning to Tighten Intellectual Property Regulation of Apple, Amazon, and Taobao

You have the right to remain silent -- but your smart devices might not. Wochit-All
SAN FRANCISCO — In what may be a first, police in Arkansas asked Amazon for recordings potentially made by an Echo device in connection with a murder investigation.
Police in Bentonville, Ark., asked Amazon for audio and other records from an Echo digital assistant in the home of James Andrew Bates after Victor Collins was found dead in Bates' hot tub last year, The Information reported Tuesday.
Bates was charged with killing Collins on Nov. 22, 2015, according to court documents.
The two had been drinking and watching football with two other friends in Bates' home. One of the friends left, but Collins and another stayed after Bates told them they could sleep on the couch and an extra bed, the affidavit for a search warrant said. Bates went to sleep, and sometime in the night, Collins died in the home's hot tub, according to the affidavit.
The cause of death was strangulation with drowning as a secondary cause, according to police. Bates was arrested and charged with the murder. He is out on bail.
Amazon declined to provide the data.
Much of the investigation is straightforward detective work. Bentonville police sought information from the house's smart water meter because Bates is accused of tampering with physical evidence by using a garden hose to wash blood off his hot tub and patio. Records show that 140 gallons of water was used in the home from 1 to 3 a.m. that day, a much heavier amount than normal, court documents said.
In a digital twist that raises questions about privacy inside the home as we increasingly surround ourselves with devices that track our movements, listen to our utterances and record our activities, police twice asked Amazon for audio from Bates' Echo.
The Bentonville Police Department requested ""electronic data in the form of audio recordings, transcribed records or other text records related to communications and transactions between An Amazon Echo device"" at Bates' residence and Amazon.com's services from Nov. 21 to 22, court documents show.
Amazon refused both times. In a statement to USA TODAY, Amazon said it will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on it. Amazon objects to overly broad or inappropriate demands as a matter of course, the company said.
Amazon did give prosecutors information about Bates' account and purchase history. According to court documents, police took the Echo and extracted information from it, though what they would have been able to get isn't clear.
Bates’ lawyer, Kimberly Weber, said that although her client is innocent and will be exonerated, she is concerned about the precedent of a search warrant including information from his Echo.
“I have a problem that a Christmas gift that is supposed to better your life can be used against you. It’s almost like a police state,” she said.
How much does Alexa remember?
The Amazon Echo is an always-on digital assistant that can answer questions, order items and stream music, among other tasks. It supports Amazon's voice-recognition program Alexa, which operates in the cloud.
The devices are very popular. According to Amazon, the Echo and the smaller Echo Dot sold in record numbers this holiday season, nine times over the sales in 2015. Though Amazon doesn't give exact information on how many Echos it has sold, it did say ""millions of new customers will be introduced to Alexa"" as a result of sales this holiday.
It's important to note that ""always listening"" doesn't mean ""always recording."" The Echo is actually always listening only for its “wake word,” which by default is the name of its voice recognition program Alexa.
The Echo keeps less than 60 seconds of recorded sound in its storage buffer. As new sound is recorded, the old is erased. So there's no audio record made of what went on in a room where an Echo sits.
Only when the Echo hears its wake-up word does it begin sending a stream of audio to the cloud to be converted into text that the program can understand and act upon. The requests are saved, though Amazon allows users to go in and erase their voice recordings. It’s possible to turn Echo’s microphones off, so it is not listening.
Privacy worries
Connected devices such as thermometers, cameras and even toys, sometimes called the Internet of Things (IoT), carry with them the possibility that users' movements, actions and utterances could be recorded and tracked, opening an arena of surveillance inside the home that concerns privacy advocates.
There's enough concern about the potential privacy implications of an always-on recording device in the home that transmits to the cloud that a Voice Privacy Industry Group was founded in March specifically to consider the issues.
Though the Arkansas request is of concern, the buffered audio data is ephemeral and not stored permanently, said Lynn Terwoerds, founder of the Voice Privacy Industry Group and executive director of the Executive Women’s Forum on Information Security and Risk Management.
“The myth we must fight against with Echo is that it's constantly listening in on you — it's not. I understand that law enforcement would have an interest in any information that could help in a murder investigation, but it can be argued that this data would be of very limited use as compared to individual privacy rights,” she said.
More broadly, users need to be aware that all Internet of Things devices might be implicated in criminal investigations, said Marc Rotenberg, president of EPIC, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a non-profit group in Washington.
To protect privacy, ""there should be clear legal standards established for law enforcement access. And manufacturers should adopt techniques for data minimization and data deletion. Devices that retain data will be the targets not only of law enforcement officials but also criminal hackers,"" he said.

62ÿ2004-12-19ÿ11ÿInedaquate working conditionsÿ1ÿPeopleÿ1ÿnegativeÿ26ÿAmazonÿ48ÿFast Companyÿhttps://www.fastcompany.com/90329525/amazon-peccyÿ"Meet Peccy, the bizarre, beloved mascot you didn’t know Amazon had
First of all, he is—I mean this as a statement of fact, not a criticism—a dumpy little blob. His arms are jointless, fingerless nubs. His legs are so vestigial that it’s not clear whether he’s ambulatory.
From his head to the toes he doesn’t have, he’s bright orange: Amazon Orange, or Pantone 1375C, to be exact. And he got his half-dimpled smile from the upturned arrow that has been part of the Amazon logo since 2000.
He’s Amazon’s mascot and cultural ambassador, Peccy.
Wait—Amazon has a mascot? I expect that this comes as news to you. Or at least it did to me. When I interviewed Amazon HR chief Beth Galetti for a profile in our new issue, we mostly talked about topics such as her unlikely career path from electrical engineer to HR pro, the challenges of hiring thousands of people a week, and her quest to use technology to better the Amazon employee experience. But as we wound up our chat, she gave me a laminated copy of the company’s leadership principles. Our conversation ended thusly, as I pointed at the character grinning from the document’s upper left-hand corner:
Me: Does this critter have a name, by the way?
Galetti: Peccy! Oh, I love Peccy. He’s called Peccy because he represents our peculiar ways. We call ourselves at Amazon very peculiar.
Me: How’s that spelled?
Galetti: P-E-C-C-Y.
Amazon PR representative: You’ll see him with a variety of different accessories, depending on what country you’re in, depending on what workplace you’re in. Sometimes he’ll have glasses, a keyboard, a hat. He’s really a master of disguise.
Amazon employees are not shy about expressing their enthusiasm for Peccy and what he stands for. [Photo: @callmejune]
Galetti: In China, they make tiny little Peccy figurines. Everybody loves Peccy.
“Love” is a subjective term, but an awful lot of people at Amazon unquestionably find Peccy to be an affable, even inspiring symbol of the company where they work. Poke around Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and you will find such staffers hobnobbing with walk-around Peccys at all-hands meetings, showing off Peccy swag, and sharing Peccy-themed memes. He also gets name-checked on LinkedIn, where current and former Amazon employees list the Peccy awards they’ve won alongside other career highlights.
Peccy “stands for all strong, motivated, hardworking Amazonians,” says one Amazon fulfillment-center employee whom I contacted after noticing Peccy popping up in her social media feeds. “I happen to be one of them.”
Peccy has been depicted in many forms, including as a decoupage Christmas tree ornament. [Photo: Harry McCracken]
Asked for details about the character, Amazon says that there’s no particular story behind him. He’s just a mascot, a symbol, as Galetti told me, of the company’s belief in the power of being peculiar. Though there’s obviously more to Peccy’s history than that—somebody created him, at a specific point in time—I choose to embrace his mystique even as I attempt to understand what he means to Amazon. Discovering that he exists at all feels like being let in on a secret.
Amazon, incidentally, is a big enough outfit to have more than one popular internal mascot. Danbo—a robot made of Amazon boxes—originated in Japanese manga, was adopted by Amazon Japan, and is now a familiar totem throughout the company. Giant versions of him stood, sentry-like, right past the security turnstiles at both of Amazon fulfillment centers I have visited. But Danbo, unlike Peccy, already has achieved a measure of fame outside of Amazon—so that is all you will read about him here.

What a character
For those of us not steeped in Amazon culture, Peccy is a bit of a Rorschach test. To me, he brings to mind Bugs Bunny’s besneakered monster nemesis Gossamer as well as Horatio, a genial li’l fella, voiced by Owen Wilson, whom Hertz briefly tried to convince us to love. I must confess that I also find him oddly reminiscent of Jeff Bezos, who is noted for always seeming to be in a good mood, though I imagine any similarity is purely coincidental. My wife compared him to venerable Hostess spokespastry Twinkie the Kid. Two of my colleagues, upon seeing him for the first time, independently brought up Philadelphia Flyers mascot Gritty—who might well be Peccy’s unshorn free-spirited brother.
Unlike garden-variety corporate mascots—from Elsie the Cow to the Geico Gecko—Peccy was never meant for public consumption. The closest thing I can find to an acknowledgment of his existence on Amazon’s site about itself is an uncaptioned photo of him beaming inside a fulfillment center in Dresden. HelpPeccy, a hackathon-project game written by a former Amazon intern, is available on the company’s app store but does not look overly official. And aside from a few (unsanctioned?) items of apparel offered by third-party sellers, there is no Peccy merch for sale on Amazon.com. The place to go for that is eBay, where there’s a fair amount of it, presumably being offloaded by Amazon employees.
10-4, good Peccy. [Photo: Harry McCracken]
If you work at the Kent, Washington, Amazon fulfillment center I toured, however, Peccy graces your presence the moment you enter the facility. He’s peering down from a sign listing the “Peculiar Ways” that gave him his name:
Amazon’s Peculiar Ways
* We earn trust with our customers by making precise, high-bar promises and then keeping them., * We are willing to make long-term investments—sometimes at the expense of short-term gain., * We share the good and the bad to help customers make informed buying decisions., * We work to avoid the bland personality that customers typically associate with the big homogeneous, corporate Borg., * We take credit for (i.e., brag about) the impressive things we do in a way that is subtle and sophisticated., * We endeavor to speak to our customers in a tone that is neither boastful nor boring., * We use specificity when possible and sensible., * We prefer to title features factually with a degree of precision., * We don’t make content look like an ad., * We stay away from creating new icons.,
Several of these credos—such as the first three—describe qualities that are recognizably Amazonian even to us outsiders. Others, like the last one, are more cryptic. And I’m still trying to figure out why one Peculiar Way is unabashedly pro-bragging while the next maintains that the company tries to avoid a boastful tone. In any event, Amazon doesn’t have a problem with people finding its culture—which is simultaneously envied, imitated, and questioned—to be a tad peculiar. Indeed, it’s a point of pride, and Peccy, though he doesn’t generally speak, is its advocate.
Peccy must have all of these committed to memory, right? (View full sizehere). [Photo: Harry McCracken]
here
But if Peccy ever devoted himself exclusively to promoting the Peculiar Ways, those days are long over: “He was everywhere,” says one ex-Amazonian, who found Peccy’s use in corporate communiqués a touch patronizing. A flyer distributed to prospective employees for a facility in Kenosha, Wisconsin, featured Peccy in a doctor’s coat (in a section about medical benefits) and fantasizing about money (in one about bonuses and Amazon’s Career Choice program, which covers training costs for high-demand occupations). Once hired, those recruits might have found him in their onboarding materials. From there, they could have acquired Peccy gear such as hats, T-shirts, socks, and water bottles.
I got these two Peccy pins from my Ambassador swag bag. They're so cute! #amazon #behindthesmile pic.twitter.com/V1gKDvfguT
— Nere (@Morb2) January 24, 2018
And oh, the pins. There are ones depicting Peccy as Superman, Wonder Woman, Harry Potter, Chewbacca, Sherlock Holmes, a ninja, both Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Mr. T, Richard Simmons, and multiple Game of Thrones characters, just to share a few examples that recipients have posted to the web. Some of these pins are given to employees for achievements such as perfect attendance—a feat more conscientious than peculiar, and evidence that Peccy is, as much as anything, an adorable manifestation of warm, fuzzy feelings about Amazon.
As far as I can tell, no central Amazon organization maintains tight control over Peccy and his image. Various arms of the company have commissioned multiple instances of Peccy baked goods, sculpture, and costumery, none of which are precisely alike and some of which prove that his deceptively simple form isn’t so easy to translate into other media. Still, he remains Peccy, even if he’s eight feet tall and made of balloons.
This would be one of your more enormous Peccys. [Photo: courtesy of Balloon Designers]
He also seems to transcend cultural boundaries with ease. As I pinged people who had posted Peccy imagery, I found myself talking to folks such as a woman in the Philippines who had helped her sister create Peccys wearing local outfits such as a Maria Clara gown for an Amazon employee contest. In Mexico City, artist Miguel Ángel Castillo Martínez has created ornate Huichol figures of Peccy, a process requiring a profusion of colorful beads, some epoxy, and about a month of labor. He says that the project began with a request from Amazon to “make something cool” and has one of the resulting Peccys up for sale with a price of $10,400.
They’re not orange—but are still instantly identifiable as Peccy. [Photo: courtesy of Miguel Ángel Castillo Martínez]
If Peccy had a more clearly defined personality—avuncular like Rich Uncle Pennybags, say, or boisterous like Kool-Aid Man—he might not appeal to so many Amazon staffers in so many places. Which, after all, is his whole reason for being.
Peccy and his critics
Inside Amazon, Peccy is such a pervasive representation of the company that it’s no shocker he’s been adopted by detractors as well as boosters. For instance, The FACE of Amazon, a group of former and current Amazon employees, retweets negative items concerning working conditions at the company from a Twitter account whose avatar is a Peccy with a frown—the Amazon arrow turned upside-down, naturally—and a black eye.
Then there’s artist Hiba Ali. Her interest in the history of shipping led to an interest in Amazon, which turned into a video performance called To Be a Box, in which she critiqued the company’s employment practices by taking on the guise of an Amazon box. Last year, after creating that piece, she spent a month working at an Amazon fulfillment center in Austin—in part as a research exercise, but also to make money. That’s where she encountered Peccy on signage. “I would see this smiling cartoon and I would wonder where the mascot was from and why he was encouraging us to work and smile and be happy,” she says.
You don’t have to love Peccy to appreciate him as an emblem of Amazon culture. [Photo: courtesy of Hiba Ali]
Ali was also intrigued by Peccy’s orange hue, which reminded her of the trim used on the vests Amazon employees wear to make themselves highly visible to the drivers of shipping vans at the company’s facilities. “Orange is the color of precarious labor,” she explains. “It’s both the color of danger and safety.” She channeled this observation into Abra, another video performance in which she—in orange skullcap, makeup, and garb, along with a safety vest, against an orange backdrop—converses with a “sarcastic and friendly” Peccy about “labor conditions and financial conditions and what the future of work looks like.”
“Peccy serves as this perfect example of what Amazon represents on a societal level,” says Ali. “It makes this big company intelligible to us through marketing.” So far, that marketing has been conducted entirely to Amazon employees. Will the company ever introduce him to Amazon customers? Probably not. modern tech companies do not generally feel the need to have mascots. (Happy exception: PagerDuty’s internal character Pagey, a footloose anthropomorphic pager, helped that company celebrate its IPO this week.)
Still, now that I know Peccy exists, I’m glad he does. He’s been hiding in plain sight all along, ready to be the vessel for our feelings about Amazon, no matter how positive, negative, or conflicted.
“Peccy is everywhere,” says Ali, expressing a sentiment that would be equally logical coming as praise from an Amazon admirer. “Because his smile is on every box.”"ÿÿMeet Peccy, the bizarre, beloved mascot you didn’t know Amazon had

The author and agent community has backed Hachette Livre UK in its terms dispute with Amazon, with leading agents spearheading a backlash against the online retailer.
The dispute has seen Amazon remove its “Buy new” button from key Hachette front and backlist titles, and drop books from promotional positions. In a letter sent to agents and authors last week, Hachette c.e.o. Tim Hely Hutchinson said he would stand firm against conceding additional trading terms, and asked authors for their patience.
He said Amazon’s sanctions were “creating a breach of trust between Amazon and its customers”, and its actions could “prove to be a catalyst for Amazon starting to lose its popularity with the public”. Despite advantageous terms, he said, “Amazon seems each year to go from one publisher to another making increasing demands in order to achieve richer terms at our expense and sometimes at yours.” At its current rate of growth, he predicted that Amazon would become the largest bookseller in Britain in three years.
Curtis Brown m.d. Jonathan Lloyd said: “I think the entire industry of publishers, authors and agents are 100% behind [Hachette]. Someone has to draw a line in the sand. Publishers have given 1% a year away to retailers, so where does it stop? Using authors as a financial football is disgraceful.”
Clare Alexander of Aitken Alexander added: “This is a disturbing glimpse of the iron in Amazon’s soul. I think its ruthlessness in bargaining is extremely disturbing.” Derek Johns of A P Watt said: “I consider [Amazon’s] attitude to terms is predatory and I entirely support Tim.”
The m.d. of a rival publisher said: “Taking the ‘Buy’ button down is the equivalent of going to a bookseller on the high street and saying, ‘Can I buy that book?’, and them saying, ‘No.’ It’s disgraceful.” Another added: “Publishers are thinking, ‘Thank God it’s Tim and not me.’”
Hachette has also received author support. Headline novelist Emma Darwin said on her blog she supported the move, “and hope I shall be unselfish enough to keep doing so even if my own sales are affected. This is about whether Amazon can be allowed to exploit its near-monopoly.”
Lloyd said it was “bloody difficult” for authors affected. “What I’m saying to Hachette is, ‘I understand and support the principle, but with the books that have been delisted on Amazon, you’ve got to sell more to other online retailers.”
An Amazon spokesman said: “[We are] totally committed to offering the broadest selection of titles possible, both through our retail offering and through Amazon Marketplace. Amazon.co.uk is also committed to ensuring we offer our customers the lowest possible prices.”

A magazine that the Humane Society of the United States says promotes cockfighting has agreed to ask Amazon.com to stop selling its publication online.
The settlement filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., on Monday is related to a lawsuit the Humane Society filed against Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc. in February 2007.
In the lawsuit, the Humane Society accused the online retailer of violating federal animal cruelty laws by selling The Gamecock and The Feathered Warrior, which the group described as cockfighting magazines.
Marburger Publishing Co., which publishes The Gamecock, agreed to settle with the Humane Society because it was a way to remove itself from the case, but the publication does not promote cockfighting or violate a federal ban on the bloody sport, said attorney Ali Beydoun of the law firm Carr Maloney.
Beydoun said the magazine also promised in the settlement ""to be more vigilant in its content."" He said the magazine intends to follow the agreement and all applicable laws.
Amazon spokeswoman Patty Smith said Tuesday the company was reviewing the agreement and had no immediate comment.
Humane Society lawyer Jonathan Lovvorn said his organization is hoping the agreement with Hartford, Ark.-based Marburger, which still needs approval from the judge hearing the case, will encourage Amazon and The Feathered Warrior, another Arkansas magazine, to come to similar agreements.
""We never wanted to have this dispute with Amazon,"" Lovvorn said, adding that the Humane Society first went to Amazon to ask the company to remove the two magazines from its site.
Amazon has argued that it has a constitutional right to sell the publications and called pulling them from sale a form of censorship.
A recent federal law added felony-level penalties for activities promoting or encouraging animal fighting. The Animal Fighting Prohibition Act of 2007 also made it a felony to knowingly sponsor or exhibit an animal fight, or to buy, sell or transport knives, gaffs and other weapons used in cockfighting.
Cockfighting is illegal in every state except Louisiana, where a legislative ban goes into effect in August.
Lovvorn called The Gamecock ""the oldest and best-known cockfighting magazine in the United States.""
Beydoun described the magazine as appealing to ""chicken aficionados,"" focusing on animal care and stories about people who raise chickens and game birds.
""It's a hard magazine to come by. It's not as available as People magazine or Vanity Fair,"" he said.
About the only places a chicken lover could buy the publication are at an animal feed store or via Amazon, where the publication was offered by a magazine distributor, not the publisher, said Barry A. Fisher, of the Los Angeles law firm Fleishman & Fisher, which also represents Marburger Publishing.
Fisher said the lawsuit isn't really about The Gamecock or The Feathered Warrior.
""Their real target is Amazon,"" he said.
Amazon has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Lovvorn said."ÿÿAlleged Cockfight Mag To Stay Off Amazon

The ebook, entitled The Paedophile’s Guide to Love and Pleasure: a Child-lover’s Code of Conduct, was available for download through Amazon’s US store for $4.79.
In the ebook, author Philip R. Greaves II claims that paedophiles are misunderstood, and offers advice about to avoid falling foul of the law.
The availability of the ebook, which can be downloaded on to Amazon’s popular Kindle reader, sparked a storm of protest, with scores of people threatening to boycott the online retailer until the text was removed from sale.
Amazon had initially refused to delete the book, saying that it “supported the right of every individual to make their own purchasing decisions”, and that removing the ebook from the site would be tantamount to censorship.
However, the document has now been deleted, although Amazon has not given any reason for its change of heart.
Authors are able to self-publish their works through Amazon’s ebook store, and receive a percentage of the money raised through sales in return. Although Amazon issues guidelines prohibiting certain works, including those deemed offensive, it does not define what is considered to constitute offensive content.
Amazon has so far not responded to questions asking it to clarify its ebook submission process, or whether e-books are scrutinised and approved before they are sold through the site. It has also not commented on whether submission rules will be tightened in the wake of this latest incident.
In 2002, Amazon was threatened with a lawsuit by the conservative United States Justice Foundation for selling a book entitled Understanding Loved Boys and Boylovers, while in 2009 it withdrew the RapeLay video game from the site after it was condemned by commentators for including scenes of rape and sexual violence."ÿÿAmazon removes 'paedophile guide' from Kindle store

The confrontation between Amazon and Hachette is growing louder and meaner, as the combatants drop all pretense that this is a reasonable dispute among reasonable people.
Amazon has proposed giving Hachetteâs authors all the revenue from their e-book sales on Amazon as the parties continue to negotiate a new contract. Hachetteâs response on Tuesday was to suggest that the retailer was trying to make it commit suicide.
âWe call baloney,â the retailer fired back.
It is rare to see billion-dollar conglomerates engage in this sort of invective. Amazon, in particular, was famous until very recently for saying as little as possible in the media. But as the dispute has dragged on, it is trying a new tactic.
For more than six months, Amazon has been trying to wring better e-book terms out of Hachette. The publisher, which is the fourth largest in the United States and whose imprints include Little Brown and Grand Central Publishing, is energetically resisting.
Amazon has responded by delaying shipments of Hachette books and making it harder for customers to order them. Hachette authors have responded by publicly excoriating Amazon.
With its newest proposal, Amazon is trying to break the impasse by getting Hachetteâs writers to switch allegiances.
That would take the heat off Amazon, which has never suffered as much sustained criticism as it is getting now. Which might also be the reason Hachette summarily rejected it.
The offer came in a letter to a few writers and agents from David Naggar, an Amazon executive who works with publishers and independent authors. It proposes âa big windfall for authorsâ by taking them âout of the middleâ of the conflict. On Tuesday, Amazon sent the proposal to Hachette itself.
The proposal âhas several real benefits â to motivate us and Hachette to reach an agreement sooner rather than later and to insulate the authors,â said Russ Grandinetti, Amazonâs senior vice president for Kindle content. âIt would make things better for readers, too,â he added.
But Roxana Robinson, president of the Authors Guild, dismissed the proposal.
âIf Amazon wants to have a constructive conversation about this, weâre ready to have one at any time,â she said in an email. âBut this seems like a short-term solution that encourages authors to take sides against their publishers. It doesnât get authors out of the middle of this â weâre still in the middle.â
The standoff has prompted a debate over the future of books, reading and American culture. Many mainstream writers have rallied to Hachetteâs side, tweeting and editorializing and blogging against Amazon. Hundreds of writers, including Stephen King and John Grisham, have signed a petition, which maintains it is not taking sides but is clearly directed at Amazon.
âWe encourage Amazon in the strongest possible terms to stop harming the livelihood of the authors on whom it has built its business,â it says. âNone of us, neither readers nor authors, benefit when books are taken hostage.â
But Amazon has its own constituency. About 6,500 writers who use its system to publish their books have come up with their own petition on Change.org.
âMajor publishers like Hachette have a long history of treating authors and readers poorly,â the petition proclaims. âAmazon, on the other hand, has built its reputation on valuing authors and readers dearly.â
In Mr. Naggarâs letter, Amazon took the opportunity to portray Hachette as unwilling to compromise or even talk to the retailer.
âWe heard nothing from them for three full months,â it says. âAfter our last proposal to them on June 5, they waited a week to respond at all, promising a counteroffer the following week. We are still waiting a month later.â
It added, âUnless Hachette dramatically changes their negotiating tempo, this is going to take a really long time.â
A Hachette executive familiar with the negotiations denied the publisher was unwilling to negotiate.
âWe made an offer in April that was the largest weâd ever made any retailer, and in May made another that was higher still,â said the executive, who refused to be quoted by name because of the negotiations. âBoth offers were rejected.â
On the evidence of their statements, the parties appear light-years apart.
Amazon wanted to cut the publisher off entirely from âits own revenue from e-books sold by Amazon, which would be a suicidal action,â Hachette said. âOnce again, Amazon acknowledges that their unilateral actions, in trying to extract much higher terms from Hachette, are harming authors.â
Nonsense, Amazon responded.
âHachette is part of a $10 billion global conglomerate,â said Amazon, which will achieve $100 billion in revenue this year. âIt wouldnât be âsuicide.â They can afford it.â
Many writers are in a third camp. Ms. Robinson, whose books are not published by Hachette, said that âwhat writers want is a long-term healthy publishing ecosystem, not a temporary windfall.â
That applies to both parties, she added. âFrom our publishers we want a fairer share of e-book revenues. from Amazon we want an end to predatory practices that unfairly threaten their competitors, as well as the continued existence of the printed book.â"ÿÿAmazon Angles to Attract Hachette's Authors to Its Side

Responding to widespread outrage and calls for a boycott, Amazon has removed a guide book for pedophiles from the Kindle store.
Amazon initially defended its decision to sell the book, stating that it ""believes it is censorship not to sell certain books simply because we or others believe their message is objectionable."" Since then, coverage of the book has exploded, and the book shot on to the best-seller list.
Now the book is gone. The timeline on its removal is odd: Amazon defended the book, then removed it, then reinstated it, and then removed it again.
So what, exactly, is Amazon's real policy here?
We've contacted the company for comment, again.

Price constraints that Amazon placed on businesses selling through its Marketplace platform have been dropped, with the move welcomed by the UK's competition regulator.
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has, since October last year, been formally investigating Amazon's price parity policy which requires Marketplace platform traders to sell at prices no higher than they sell at through other online sales channels. The regulator was prompted to begin an investigation after some businesses complained that Amazon's policy prevented them from setting prices on their own websites or through rival e-commerce platforms. The OFT has been reviewing whether the policy was anti-competitive and would result in consumers paying higher prices for goods.
However, the OFT has now said that it is ""minded to close its investigation [into Amazon] on grounds of administrative priority"" after Amazon decided to put an end to the operation of its price parity policy within the EU from Thursday. The regulator has not reached a decision as to whether there has been an infringement of competition law but it said, though, that it continues to monitor the online retail sector and could use its power to investigate such price parity policies at any time.
""We welcome Amazon’s decision to end its Marketplace price parity policy across the European Union,"" Cavendish Elithorn, senior director of the OFT's goods and consumer unit, said. ""As Amazon operates one of the UK’s biggest e-commerce sites, the pricing on its website can have a wide impact on online prices offered to consumers elsewhere. We are pleased that sellers are now completely free to set their prices as they wish, as this encourages price competition and ensures consumers can get the best possible deals.""
""The OFT recommends that other companies operating similar policies review them carefully. Businesses concerned that they are being prevented from setting their own prices should not hesitate to contact the OFT,"" Elithorn said.
The OFT said it has been working closely with Germany's competition regulator during its investigation. The German Federal Cartel Office has been running its own investigation into Amazon's price parity policy.
Both UK and EU competition law prohibit agreements, arrangements and concerted business practices which appreciably prevent, restrict or distort competition, or have the intention of so doing, and which affect trade in the UK or the EU respectively.
""Amazon informed the OFT that, from 30 August 2013, it will: discontinue enforcement of contractual price parity obligations as to all European Union Marketplace sellers. remove the Marketplace price parity policy clauses from all current versions of Amazon’s click-through agreements across the European Union. and notify all other current European Union Marketplace sellers on individually negotiated agreements that it has ceased enforcement of the price parity obligations with the intention of removing the provisions from those agreements when they are next renewed,"" the OFT said in its statement.

Amazon threat on direct selling
* Plus: UK fears over Amazon.com print on demand. Roger Tagholm reports AMAZON HAS THREATENED publishers who sell direct at discount on their own websites with punitive action. PN understands that it has said that if the publisher continues, Amazon will take the selling price as the RRP and apply its terms of trading to that price. In other words, if Amazon receives a 50% discount from Penguin, for example, but Penguin is selling a £20 book for £15 on its website, Amazon will only give Penguin £7.50, rather than £10. One publisher told PN: “This has been around for a while. There have been discussions going on since Frankfurt. Essentially, they're not happy when the manufacturer, as they call us, sets the price of a book. The threat is that they will apply the agreed terms of trading to our web price. But they are on very shaky legal ground. After all, they've been invoiced at an RRP less their discount, so if they refused to pay that amount, they would be in breach of contract.” Another publisher was more forthright. “Nobody can tell somebody else what price to sell a book at. Publishers will resist this. We're talking about very few titles and we are very confident of our position.” Although the number of titles being sold direct by publishers is very few, some observers believe Amazon sees it as the thin end of the wedge and wants to fire a warning shot. The move is being driven by Amazon's UK Head of Books, Christopher North, and comes as a blog storm has erupted over Amazon.com's announcement concerning its print-on-demand operation BookSurge. Independent publishers are angered by the US company's decision to economically favour those companies that switch their printing to BookSurge. The row forced Amazon to release an open letter clarifying its position. Amazon.com will sell titles from other PoD providers it said, but the publishers would have to join Amazon's Advantage Program, which has a fee. Amazon UK said that are no plans to introduce the service here, but one publisher is taking legal advice. “They're abusing their monopoly position. Once they've got you, they'll start increasing the terms.” In the background to the moves may be Amazon's realisation that it has effectively dominated online bookselling for some years. Its figures with publishers grow faster than any other retailer (hence publishers' reluctance to anger it), but with other players establishing their online operations - Waterstones.com and, shortly, Borders as well as increasing noise from Play.com and publishers' own sites - it realises that this soon might change.,

110ÿ2006-12-16ÿÿÿ5ÿProducts & Servicesÿ1ÿnegativeÿ26ÿAmazonÿ30ÿThe Guardianÿhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/16/amazoncouk-banned-dangerous-weapons-found-sale#comment-65204402ÿ"Banned and dangerous weapons found for sale on Amazon.co.uk
Banned and dangerous weapons, many of them disguised as everyday items, are being routinely and illegally sold to online shoppers on Amazon.co.uk, a Guardian investigation has found.
Illegal weapons, including some reputedly developed for military and police forces, have been put up for sale in breach of UK firearms and offensive weapons laws.
In test purchases, the Guardian bought three weapons on Amazon.co.uk: a pistol that fires a jet of high-strength pepper spray at 112mph. a 1m-volt stun gun disguised as a torch. and a baseball cap containing a hidden stabbing knuckleduster in its peak. The sale of all three is illegal.
A spokesperson from the National Crime Agency said such items “aren’t harmless souvenirs or toys – they are dangerous weapons capable of causing serious harm and facilitating further crime.
“Importing them isn’t worth the risk when you consider that you can spend five years in prison.”
The stun gun and cap were dispatched to the Guardian by independent Amazon sellers in the US and Israel respectively. On customs paperwork the packages were declared as an “LED flashlight” and a “toy part”. The cap was wrongly marked as an imported gift, while the value of the stun gun was given as $9.99, rather than the £99.95 paid by the Guardian.
The pepper spray pistol was sold directly by Amazon and couriered promptly from its warehouse outside Milton Keynes, where the company has held the product line at least intermittently for 14 months, making sales and replenishing stock levels.
The Guardian has learned that police in Scotland are already investigating an Amazon sale of the same pistol model to a customer in Edinburgh in October last year.
Even though the online retailer’s legal department was aware of the investigation, Amazon.co.uk continued to advertise, sell, and top up stock in its UK warehouse. The Guardian was able to buy the pistol with ease, receiving it within 48 hours of ordering.
The stun gun was bought just days after the high-profile conviction of Nathan Matthews and his girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, for the murder of his step-sister, Becky Watts. At trial the jury heard how Matthews had bought two stun guns, also disguised as torches, on the internet for £18 using his mobile phone. The weapons had estimated voltages of 8,230 volts and 8,450 volts.
Matthews told the court he had not known they were illegal. He explained he had intended to use them on Watts until she passed out as part of a kidnap attempt – an attempt that was botched, ending in her death.
The Guardian was able to buy a stun gun on Amazon.co.uk similar in appearance to the one purchased by Matthews. It was sold by a US seller company in St Charles, Missouri, and in one email exchange about delivery times the firm volunteered: “We are technically not supposed to sell these in the UK.” The weapon was sent anyway.
The cap containing the concealed stabbing weapon was jointly designed by the Israeli martial arts expert, Yaron Hanover, and FAB Defense, a firm that claims to make “tactical equipment” for the Israel military and police.
The cap is not dissimilar to those reputedly used by a 19th-century Birmingham crime gang, which stitched razor blades into the peaks of their cloth caps. The gang, known as the Peaky Blinders, were the inspiration behind a BBC2 television drama of the same name.
Despite the sale of dangerous weapons by Amazon and other sellers using its UK site, official literature from the company stipulates: “Products sold on the Amazon.co.uk site must comply with all applicable laws ... Items classified as weapons under UK legislation including the Firearms Act 1968 and the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 are prohibited.”
Amazon provides sellers with a list of 42 banned weapons, including pepper spray, stun guns and weapons designed to be concealed or disguised. Also on the list are grenades, nunchucks, butterfly knives and brass knuckles.
But the Guardian has found a large number of items, clearly capable of doubling as weapons, advertised for sale on Amazon.co.uk. They include:
• Knuckleduster gloves containing lead shot.
• A “lady pink” miniature pepper spray aerosol on a key ring.
• A keychain that doubles as a martial arts weapon known as a monkey fist or kusari.
• A “3m volt” stun gun disguised in lipstick casing.
The Guardian sent details of these and its sample weapon purchases to Amazon, which removed all items from sale immediately.
The three items were handed over to two Metropolitan police officers on Wednesday afternoon, shortly after the Guardian’s story was published online.
In a statement, Amazon said: “All [Amazon] sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don’t will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The products in question are no longer available.” Amazon declined to comment on the fact it is the seller of Guardian Angel II pepper pistols.
A Home Office spokesperson said selling such weapons was against the law: “It is an offence to sell any prohibited firearms – including stun guns – and we are increasing the maximum prison sentence for this offence from 10 years to life in prison.
“Nor should anyone intending to carry these weapons in the UK be in any doubt of their illegality. Anyone caught in possession of a weapon banned in the UK faces being charged with illegal importation of a prohibited weapon, which can lead to a prison sentence.
The Home Office added: “The government is taking action with both online and high street retailers to reduce the availability of knives and other prohibited weapons as part of our forthcoming modern crime prevention strategy.”
Pepper spray has often been used in unprovoked attacks or robberies and is illegal in the UK under the Firearms Act. .
In 2008, BBC2’s Watchdog investigated illegal pepper spray products sold by independent traders on Amazon.co.uk. The retailer’s then UK managing director, Brian McBride, told the programme he took dangerous and illegal weapons very seriously, that such listings would not be tolerated, and that any offending items identified would be “removed within the hour”.
Since then pepper spray and other dangerous and illegal weapons have reappeared on Amazon.co.uk.
In 2011, the company ended a close working relationship it had built up with its primary trading standards authority in Slough.
Many nationwide retailers, from eBay to Tesco, choose to keep in regular contact with a “primary authority” in order to make it easier to comply with trading standards laws and improve intelligence about regulatory matters. Amazon does not.
• This article was amended on 15 March 2016. An earlier version said that in 2014, a 21-year-old bus passenger was attacked with pepper spray and beaten by a man on a journey in Birmingham. In fact a court was told that the man used lemon juice, not pepper spray."ÿÿBanned and dangerous weapons found for sale on Amazon.co.uk

Editor’s note: The reaction resulting from this story is flying in so fast we’ve moved it all to its own page. Please check here for the latest developments and stories.
——
Some Print on Demand (POD) publishers are privately screaming “Monopoly!” while others are seething with rage over startling phone conversations they’re having with Amazon/BookSurge representatives. Why isn’t anybody talking about it openly? Because they’re afraid – very, very afraid.
Amazon.com purchased BookSurge, a small POD publisher/printer back in 2005. Amazon also lists and sells titles for the largest POD printer, Lightning Source, which is owned by Ingram (the large book distributor). According to their website, Lightning Source serves more than 4,300 publisher clients and has more than 400,000 titles in their system.
You’d think Amazon’s purchase of BookSurge might have made things a bit uncomfortable between the two companies. However, they continued to work together, getting books on demand to Amazon.com’s loyal customers. Things appeared to be cruising along just fine, but perhaps not anymore.
Reports have been trickling in from the POD underground that Amazon/BookSurge representatives have been approaching some Lightning Source customers, first by email introduction and then by phone (nobody at BookSurge seems to want to put anything in writing). When Lightning Source customers speak with the BookSurge representative, the reports say, they are basically told they can either have BookSurge start printing their books or the “buy” button on their Amazon.com book pages will be “turned off.”
The book information would remain on Amazon, and people could still order the book from resellers (companies that list new and used books in Amazon’s Marketplace section), but customers would not be able to buy the book from Amazon directly, nor qualify for the coveted “free shipping” that Amazon offers.
Don’t believe it? I didn’t believe it either. I am Angela Hoy, the co-owner of POD services company BookLocker.com and publisher of WritersWeekly.com. I am well-known in the industry for my activism performed through WritersWeekly Whispers and Warnings. Over the years, we have helped writers recover tens of thousands of dollars in fees from deadbeat editors and publishers, helped them negotiate better contract terms, assisted writers in obtaining payment after their copyrights have been violated, and even assisted police in collecting evidence to prosecute criminals who have preyed on writers. I am also the author of 11 non-fiction books.
Still doubting the reports could really be true, I emailed an Amazon/BookSurge representative who’s been trying to get us to talk to him by phone. John Clifford of Amazon/BookSurge called me at 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday, March 26, 2008.
My first comment was to tell him we heard a rumor that POD publishers who didn’t use BookSurge would have the “buy” button on their Amazon.com book pages turned off.
He said, “What? Who told you that? That’s not true!”
I told him I’d heard some rumors from the “POD underground.”
He said he’d previously tried to talk to my husband, Richard Hoy, the President and CEO of BookLocker. I explained that we had a very bad experience with BookSurge in the past and that he was, naturally, hesitant to do business with them again. (Google the words BookSurge complaint without any quotes to see other customers’ comments about them as well.)
He claimed the people who worked for BookSurge back then are probably all gone (but that didn’t explain the more recent complaints). He made his sales pitch, talking about percentages and such, and said many POD publishers are resisting their attempts to convert to BookSurge. Mr. Clifford also said BookSurge’s aim was to help Amazon customers get their books faster.
What he didn’t say was that Lightning Source not only packages books for Amazon customers in boxes that feature an Amazon.com return address label, but also drop-ships those orders directly to Amazon customers at Amazon’s request. Hmm...
He stated several times that books not converted to BookSurge’s system would be “taken down.” Since that wasn’t exactly what we’d heard, I asked about books that perhaps weren’t selling well, that aren’t good candidates for converting to BookSurge (books that would remain for sale through Lightning Source, but would never be converted to BookSurge due to the time/expense involved).
Contrary to what he stated at the very beginning of our conversation, Mr. Clifford finally admitted that books not converted to BookSurge would have the “buy” button turned off on Amazon.com, just as we’d heard from several other POD publishers who had similar conversations with Amazon/BookSurge representatives.
Mr. Clifford said authors of those books could participate in the Amazon.com Advantage Program, meaning they would have to pay Amazon $29.95 per year PLUS 55% of the list price of their book, as well as buy and then send those books to Amazon directly for them to warehouse and ship to customers.
I explained to him that we had more than 1500 books in print and that it would take quite awhile to convert all of those over to BookSurge’s system. He said as long as the relationship was “moving forward” that the “buy” button would remain active on our authors’ books that had not yet been switched.
Another comment Mr. Clifford made was that their eventual desire is to have no books from other POD publishers available on Amazon.com.
WHAT ARE THEY THINKING?!
I have to wonder if Jeff Bezos is even aware of what is going on within his organization. Here is Amazon’s Vision Statement, taken directly from their website:
“Our vision is to be earth’s most customer centric company. to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.”
What it doesn’t say is, “Our customers can buy any print on demand book they might want online...as long as we also get paid to print it.”
Nobody likes being backed into a corner, and saying “do this or else” naturally breeds angry rejection and hostility. If we did agree to sign the contract, pulling and transferring files to Amazon/Booksurge would take an enormous amount of time and money. From the POD publishers we’ve talked to, and from our own experience at BookLocker, we could all be looking at a dire and immediate threat of revenue cuts if we refuse to sign the Amazon/BookSurge contract. Most importantly, there could be an outcry from and potential financial hardship on the authors, who are completely innocent in all of this.
In BookLocker’s opinion, and the opinion of all the fellow Lightning Source customers we talked to, the Amazon/BookSurge proposal does not appear attractive at all (yes, we obtained the contract and the file submission specifications). Amazon/BookSurge would make money two ways on Amazon.com sales – first the fee for printing the books, and then 48% of the list price of each sale through Amazon.com. Lightning Source allows its customers to set their own discount rate for Amazon and other retail sales, and does not force POD publishers or authors to pay “48%.”
Furthermore, it could take the larger POD publishers months to submit their book files to Amazon/BookSurge, at a considerable cost and number of man-hours. This makes the deal even less attractive. Finally, while the initial list of books submitted by POD publishers could be submitted to Amazon/BookSurge for free, the contract states future books would cost $50 each to process. The cost for individual authors to publish through BookSurge is considerably more, with an average publishing package cost of more than $1,000.
Since Amazon/BookSurge does not offer Ingram distribution (Ingram distribution is considered imperative in the industry for bookstore sales), any company that accepts the Amazon/BookSurge deal, who desires to keep offering Ingram distribution, may need to maintain two copies of the book files. Since the Amazon/BookSurge current specs don’t match the Lightning Source specs, future book files, both interior and cover, may need to be formatted separately. So, they would have to pay double the setup fees and might have to do double the formatting work as well...or pay designers to do double the formatting work.
Likewise, self-published authors who believe they must have Ingram Distribution AND an active “buy” button on Amazon to be successful may need to pay double the setup fees (to a POD publisher AND Amazon/BookSurge), and also may need to create two separate sets of formatted files.
In the event where two versions of a book might be available, Mr. Clifford said the Amazon/BookSurge version of the POD book would trump (override) the version offered by Lightning Source on Amazon.com.
AMAZON WAS BUILT BY BOOKS....That Were Written By AUTHORS
When authors get wind of this, we believe they are going to be livid. Authors are also readers. They love books. We suspect they buy from Amazon in droves. I, myself, have been an Amazon junkie for years, not only heavily promoting Amazon.com in my non-fiction books for writers and on our very popular website, WritersWeekly.com, but also listing my own books for sale there, ordering other authors’ books, DVDs and numerous other products as well. I pulled up our Amazon customer account and looked at our receipts. We’ve spent $1508.81 at Amazon.com in the past six months. Multiply that by the number of authors this will affect...authors who, like me, have a multitude of websites to choose from when doing their shopping online.
In addition, authors participate in the Amazon experience, via blogs on the website, by posting reviews about other books, and more, activities that help to continually make Amazon bigger and better. Authors are a loyal bunch! For years, they’ve been faithfully sending their readers to Amazon.com, again and again, even when they earned lower royalties for doing so.
It’s not inconceivable to think that this group, if shoved against a wall like this, won’t simply pledge their allegiance elsewhere. Let’s face it, BarnesandNoble.com offers free shipping on orders of $25 or more, too. Authors can change the links to their book pages on their websites, in their ezines and press releases, and even in their email signatures to their book’s page at BarnesandNoble.com. Authors can spend their own money elsewhere as well (as I plan to do). I imagine BarnesandNoble.com will be very happy to process the extra book sales that could result from all of this.
Amazon.com might also upset countless companies that have Amazon Affiliate bookstores on their websites (many authors have these, too!). If Amazon/BookSurge were to follow through with turning off the “buy” buttons for thousands of POD titles, customers following those links from other websites could be confused and annoyed. After clicking on a link, they would find no easy way to purchase the book directly from Amazon, and no way to obtain free shipping on that book, even if they’re willing to buy more products to meet the $25 free shipping threshold. One would think Amazon must know the free shipping strategy works to upsell customers on additional products. That’s why they offer it. Without it, these customers could have no incentive to buy more products because the product they surfed in to buy does not qualify.
One has to wonder if traditional publishers will be next? Will Amazon eventually require all books sold through Amazon.com to be printed by BookSurge?
Let’s all hope and pray this situation is one huge, misguided idea from some mid-level management person and not corporate policy being dictated from the office of Jeff Bezos.
What can you do? Let Amazon know what you think about this “offer” by Amazon/BookSurge.

~~PERSONAL POSTSCRIPT TO AUTHORS FROM ANGELA~~
There is no reason to panic. Not having an active “buy” button on Amazon.com is not the end of the world.
After selling print books for eight years, it has been our experience that “chance purchases” of self-published books on Amazon.com are not the norm. Authors slap books up on Amazon.com all the time, don’t market them, and sell zero copies. For most self-published authors, sales are almost always author-driven, meaning the bookstore link you use in YOUR marketing efforts is what’s driving your sales, not just simply having your book listed on Amazon.com.
We know from experience that the customer is going to buy your book from where you tell them to buy your book. If you want your customers to qualify for free shipping, you can send them to BarnesandNoble.com, and tell them their order might qualify for free shipping (many people don’t know BarnesandNoble.com offers free shipping!).
THESE ARE THE ACTION ITEMS WE ARE GIVING TO OUR BOOKLOCKER.COM AUTHORS:
1. Remove all Amazon.com links from your marketing materials – website, ezine, blog, email signature, press releases, articles — everything.
2. Change those links to your book’s page on BarnesandNoble.com. To obtain that link, search for your book’s title at http://www.bn.com. All Booklocker.com print books are on their website.
3. If/when the booklocker.com “buy” buttons are turned off on Amazon.com and you feel your button absolutely must be on, please contact Angela to discuss how we can help you participate in their Advantage program.
4. Don’t forget to contact Amazon to tell them what you’re doing in response to their horrible actions!"ÿÿAmazon.com Telling POD Publishers – Let BookSurge Print Your Books, or Else…

The internet retailer Amazon has found itself at the centre of a censorship row after it decided to remove a number of so-called adult books from its online charts.
Over the weekend, thousands of books have lost their sales rank – the number that Amazon uses to show how well one title sells compared with another – as the company apparently seeks to make its bestseller lists more family friendly.
But thousands of users have voiced concern after the seemingly random application of the new rules not only affected a number of high-profile authors, including Annie Proulx, EM Forster and Jeanette Winterson, but also led to thousands of gay and lesbian titles being stripped of their sales rank, regardless of their sexual content.
After being bombarded with angry emails from authors and readers, Amazon blamed a ""glitch"" in its system, which it said last night was being fixed.
But just a few days ago, the company told complainants books classed as containing ""adult material"" had been prevented from appearing in some searches and bestseller lists ""in consideration of our entire customer base"". Yesterday a spokeswoman denied there was ever any such ""policy"".
Rankings matter to authors because they affect how their books come up in a search. The higher the ranking, the more likely the book is to come up when a customer is looking for it.
As of this morning, books without rankings included Gore Vidal's The City and the Pillar and Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit.
Maurice, Forster's coming-of-age tale about a young man's first gay love, had also disappeared, along with the 2004 Booker-winning novel The Line of Beauty, by Alan Hollinghurst.
The ranking removal seemed to depend on how Amazon filed each book. The 2003 paperback edition of Fry's autobiography Moab Is My Washpot, which Amazon tags as ""gay"", is unranked, whereas the original hardback , filed under ""memoir"", has a ranking.
Amazon's customers are able to tag books themselves, and a number of contributors have flagged up hundreds of books affected by the ""glitch"" using the tag amazonfail.
The affected books all seem to have hetero- and/or homosexual content. The New Joy of Sex, an updated version of the 70s classic, which is filed under the subject ""sex/sexuality"", has lost its ranking, while the original edition (subject ""love/sex/marriage""), from 1974, is ranked. DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, meanwhile, is now unranked.
The removals prompted furious remarks on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere online.
One Twitter user noted: ""THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK is ranked. THE JOY OF SEX is unranked. In other words, Amazon would rather you make napalm than get laid.""
Zoe Margolis, the blogger and author of Girl With A One-Track Mind, complained on her Twitter feed that the US edition of her book, which Amazon had filed under ""sexuality"" or ""erotica"", had lost its ranking, while the UK version, filed under ""memoir"", was ranked.
""It's as if Amazon said 'An idea! Let's get rid of all the queers and perverts!!!' and then reset all their search algorithms,"" she wrote.
She told the Guardian that if the policy was really to safeguard users from ""adult"" content, it was inconsistent, as many titles had slipped through the net.
""Horribly ironically, the stuff that does seem to be widely available are books like the Playboy Centrefold collection, which Amazon classes as 'photography',"" she said.
Jeanette Winterson told the Guardian: ""I hate categories anyway, I think they are unhelpful, but if Amazon are making a value judgment here, then that's much more serious and obviously that needs to be addressed.""
Craig Seymour, author of the gay memoir All I Could Bare: My Life in the Strip Clubs of Gay Washington, D.C, wrote on his blog yesterday that his sales rank was dropped in February, then restored nearly four weeks later, after he was told by Amazon that his book had been ""classified as an adult product"".
When one author, Mark R Probst, wrote to Amazon last week to ask whether the firm has ""some sort of campaign to suppress the visibility of gay books"", he received a similar reply.
""In consideration of our entire customer base, we exclude 'adult' material from appearing in some searches and bestseller lists. Since these lists are generated using sales ranks, adult materials must also be excluded from that feature,"" explained ""Ashlyn D"" from Amazon's member services department.
When contacted by the Guardian, an Amazon spokeswoman said that there was ""a glitch in our systems and it's being fixed"". However, the company refused to elaborate on why that move was made, or how the filter to choose which books were excluded was applied.
An online petition, which already has almost 10,000 signatures, is lobbying Amazon to answer questions about the seeming double standard, and other complainants have sent objections to the Seattle-based company.
Although the move does not mean the affected books are no longer on sale, it does block them from being able to access some of the site's most powerful areas – potentially affecting sales as a result. Without sales ranks, books cannot appear on many of the site's popular charts or suggestion pages, for example.
The move has left authors, publishers and readers angry, but also highlights the extent to which Amazon has become one of the most powerful forces in the publishing industry – with the power to make or break a book."ÿÿ'Gay writing' falls foul of Amazon sales ranking system

Activists are calling on Amazon employees globally to strike during one the company's busiest trading periods - and for shoppers to boycott the retail tech giant.
Workers are being asked to walk out on Amazon Prime Day, when the company slashes the price of hundreds of thousands of products for its Prime customers.

Union leaders in Spain have called on 1,000 laborers to down tools in a row over workers' rights, while some workers in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Poland are also striking.
Activists are also calling on customers around the world to boycott the sales in solidarity.
Strikes
The official strike in Spain will be timed around Prime Day, which begins at noon on 16 July and runs for 36 hours.
Douglas Harper, a representative of the Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) union said their complaints concerned wage cuts, working conditions and restrictions on time off.
“Strikes aren’t good for anyone, not the company, the workers or the customers, but we need to keep putting pressure on local management,” Mr Harper told Reuters.
Organisers are calling on workers and customers around the world to join the strike as part of a global day of action against the firm.

""Remember to stand in solidarity with Amazon workers from the 10th-16th!"" wrote Twitter user Mackenzie Harris in a post that has been shared thousands of times.
""Don’t make purchases, stream movies, even open the website. #AmazonStrike is a transnational movement protesting working conditions in facilities. Safety should never be second to profit.""
Responding to the call to strike, the company said in a statement: “Amazon’s total pay is at the high end of the range in the logistics sector, it includes an attractive salary and an extensive benefits package.”
What is Amazon Prime Day?
The worldwide sale takes place on Monday 16 July on Amazon.
TVs, smart home, kitchen, grocery, toys, furniture, fashion, appliances and other products will be discounted, though some will be 'lightning deals' which will disappear quickly.
The discounts are available only for Amazon Prime members, Amazon's subscription service which ensures faster and cheaper item delivery and access to its TV and Music services.
A Prime subscription costs £79 per year, or £7.99 per month. Would-be shoppers can also sign up for a 30-day free trial.
Black Friday is the day after the US Thanksgiving holiday where shops reopen with big sales and has expanded internationally as a time for sales to open the Christmas shopping period."ÿÿAmazon strike: workers ask public to boycott Prime Day

Amazon, Starbucks, Google, Apple, Boots, Caffe Nero, travel operator Tui ... the list of companies named in the debate over tax avoidance grows ever longer. So where can shoppers spend their hard-earned money and know that the company isn't funnelling the cash offshore and paying virtually no corporation tax? Figures prepared for Guardian Money by Ethical Consumer magazine reveal where you can shop with confidence.
Top of its list is Lush, the high street hand-made cosmetics chain and multinational with operations in more than 40 countries. Yet it has chosen not to use devices such as tax havens and ""transfer pricing"" to hide profits. Researchers at Ethical Consumer found that it paid 42% tax on its £21m profits in the UK last year, giving £8.9m to the Treasury. Amazon, meanwhile, revealed to the Commons public accounts committee last month that it had sales in the UK of £2.9bn, yet paid just £1.8m in tax.
If Amazon enjoys the same level of profit margin as Lush, and paid tax at the same rate, then Amazon would be handing over nearly £100m a year to the Treasury – enough to build five secondary schools.
Other store chains scoring highly in Ethical Consumer's research were John Lewis, which paid 35% tax on its profits last year, Marks & Spencer (27%), Next (26%) and Debenhams (22%). Ethical Consumer examined the percentage of actual tax paid on profits and only included companies that did not have ""high risk"" subsidiaries in tax havens.
Lush co-founder and managing director Mark Constantine accuses Amazon of operating a legal but ""basically corrupt business model"" and reveals how top business people, like himself, are repeatedly touted complex schemes to skirt taxes, such as running profits through Ireland or Luxembourg. ""I could spend all day in meetings with accountants and tax experts who show you how you can pay less. In one year, one of our competitors paid just 2%. But it just doesn't feel right.""
He says tax avoidance in Britain has become such a part of boardroom culture that executives are focusing on these schemes and taking their eye off the main job – running their businesses.
""We are big in Japan and have a lot of Japanese staff. There, they absolutely refuse to fiddle their taxes. From the bottom of the company to the top, the staff would absolutely refuse to do it. What we need here is a return to a climate where businesses are not focussed on strange machinations to avoid tax but, instead, on the important things that make you a commercial success.""
But the government needs to take the lead, he says. ""It has to set the rules and vigorously enforce them. In some ways, I'm embarrassed that our business came top in the Ethical Consumer survey. Other businesses probably think we're stupid. We even looked at taking the tax rates paid by all of our competitors over five years, averaging that out and paying 10% more. But even that would have involved us in schemes we didn't want to get into. It's the government that's got to get a lot more vigorous.""
But shoppers don't have to wait for the government to act – many have already begun their personal boycotts. Margaret Hodge MP was so angered by Amazon's aggressive policies that she has already publicly declared that from now on she will stop using it. A poll that ran on the Guardian's website earlier this week asked readers if they would be boycotting Amazon this Christmas: 53% said they would, but 47% said no. Typical of the comments from those people against was: ""Blame the government for not legislating against tax evasion. Don't blame the companies for saving money.""
Today Ethical Consumer, an independent co-operative that produces guides, ratings and best-buy advice, is launching a broader ""Boycott Amazon"" campaign. Tim Hunt, who calculated the figures on tax for Guardian Money says: ""With this research we hope to give consumers some better options. What we have produced is by no means a definitive list. For example, there will be many small independent retailers paying the proper amount of tax who deserve recognition. However, we wanted to produce a list of widely available brands to make it as easy as possible for consumers to avoid using Amazon.
""Over the past few weeks and months there has been an increasing demand to find alternatives. People are rightly angry and are looking to shop with retailers, both online and on the high street, that pay their fair share.
""The companies we are recommending are paying a much higher rate of tax on their profits than Amazon, and contributing a more proper amount to the public purse. During this time of swingeing public service cuts, we feel that this is vitally important as every penny counts.""
But what of the hundreds of traders that use Amazon Marketplace? Amazon is just a platform on which they sell their goods, and many have voiced serious concerns about losing business from a boycott, even though they pay their fair share of taxes. Ethical Consumer says: ""There's no reason why tax-paying traders should take a hit from our boycott. If you see an item on Amazon that you'd like to buy, simply find the name of the company online and then go to the company's website and buy directly.""

India has threatened to cancel the visas of Amazon employees if the retailer continues to sell doormats featuring the country's flag.
Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj made the threat Wednesday on Twitter, saying that if the offending product is not removed from Amazon's Canada website, she would not grant visas to Amazon officials and ""rescind the visas issued earlier.""
Swaraj described the product as ""unacceptable"" and directed the Indian High Commission in Canada to take the issue up with Amazon at ""the highest level.""
""Amazon must tender unconditional apology,"" she said. ""They must withdraw all products insulting our national flag immediately.""

Amazon (AMZN) representatives in the United States did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But a company spokeswomen in India said they needed ""time to assess and respond.""
One of the company's customer service accounts on Twitter also addressed the issue, saying the products were never sold on Amazon's India site.
""We have escalated this to our concerned teams and are working on the issue,"" the tweet said.
The flag's product listing page was soon inundated with comments.
""You cannot insult a national flag of India by making a doormat of it,"" said one user. ""Delete this listing immediately.""
The product rating also reflected anger: The doormat had a couple 5-star ratings, but 46 ratings of only 1-star.

Like many countries, India maintains a Flag Code that stipulates how the national symbol should be treated. The rules state that the flag, often called the Tricolour, should never touch the ground.
It also prescribes very specific ways in which the flag should be flown. It should never be printed on clothing or furniture. Using it as a doormat would violate multiple rules.
Vikas Swarup, a spokesman for the Indian foreign ministry, said he had nothing to add to the minister's tweets.

* Amazon's demand for a provision to install a helipad at its HQ2 was repeatedly criticized during a hearing with the New York City Council on Wednesday., * Multiple City Council members questioned the importance of its inclusion, said it appeared out of touch with New Yorkers, or cited it as reason why the company's tax incentives were unnecessary., * ""The only transportation aspect of this project is a helipad,"" Corey Johnson, speaker of the council, said during his opening remarks.,
New York City Council is not happy with Amazon.
In a public hearing about the company's HQ2 project on Wednesday, members of the economic development committee peppered Amazon executives Brian Huseman, vice president of public policy, and Holly Sullivan, head of worldwide economic development, with questions.
Many of the questions mentioned what the members saw as a questionable inclusion of a provision for a helipad to be built as part of the project. The helipad was included in the memorandum of understanding that stands as an agreement for Amazon to start planning part of its HQ2 project in Long Island City, Queens. The provision was also included in Amazon's agreement with Northern Virginia, where it will build the other half of its HQ2.
Multiple City Council members questioned the importance of its inclusion, said it appeared out of touch with New Yorkers, or cited it as reason why the company's tax incentives were unnecessary.
""The only transportation aspect of this project is a helipad,"" Corey Johnson, speaker of the council, said during his opening remarks, relating it to a lack of promises from Amazon to fund transit projects. ""So yes, Jeff Bezos' commute is all set. But what about the rest of New Yorkers?""

In council member Jimmy Van Bramer's opening remarks, he cited ""Bezos' damn helipad"" as evidence that the city had given too much and not asked for enough in return.
Later in the hearing, Johnson asked Huseman why Amazon felt it needed to add the helipad provision into the memorandum.
Huseman responded by saying Amazon will be funding the construction of the helipad, neither he nor any member of Amazon's senior team commutes by helicopter, and Amazon's Seattle headquarters does not have a helipad.
The helipad provision was added, according to Huseman, because the company wanted to ""look to the future"" and have the provision in place for a later time.
Johnson responded: ""Do you realize how out of touch that seems for the average New Yorker?"""ÿÿ'Do you realize how out of touch that seems?': NYC lawmakers rail against Amazon for HQ2 helipad demand in heated hearing

Warning: This story addresses suicidal threats by Amazon employees.
Operator: Lebanon Police and Fire. Where’s your emergency?
Caller: Hi, I’m at 500 Duke Drive in Lebanon, so it’s the Amazon building. I’ve got an associate threatening suicide, she has very specific plans and has shown scratches more than anything on her arms but she’s trying to leave the building. She needs medical help, we can’t keep her here.
Operator: Police dispatch
Caller: Yes, hi, I wanted to see if we could get an officer out to the Amazon facility. I have an associate who had written a suicide letter to her children that was discovered on her today.
Caller: Hey this is Chris, loss prevention Amazon. How you doing?
Operator: Good how are you?
Caller: Not too bad, I need EMS to start our way please. I have a suicidal employee in one of our offices, he attempted to cut himself three or four times tonight. And he is willing to go with EMS.
Operator: OK, what did he attempt to cut himself with?
Caller: One of our safety box cutters.
Dozens and dozens of times over five years, calls were made from Amazon warehouses to 911 dispatchers about men and women on the brink.
There was the suicidal employee in Hebron, Kentucky, who police said “is pregnant and threatening the baby” in December 2016. The 22-year-old woman in Joliet, Illinois, who said she wanted to “stab herself in the stomach” that same month. And the young man who threatened to “jump from [the] second floor” of the warehouse in Chester, Virginia, in January 2015.
Between October 2013 and October 2018, emergency workers were summoned to Amazon warehouses at least 189 times for suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, and other mental-health episodes, according to 911 call logs, ambulance and police reports reviewed and analyzed by The Daily Beast.
The reports came from 46 warehouses in 17 states—roughly a quarter of the sorting and fulfillment centers that comprise the company’s U.S. network. Jurisdictions for other Amazon warehouses either did not have any suicide reports or declined requests for similar logs.
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255)
Amazon, founded by the now-richest man in the world, has long faced criticism about working conditions at its warehouses: the high-pressure pace, the stultifying boredom, the timed bathroom breaks, and the digital surveillance that monitors performance.
The 911 calls and police reports collected through open-record requests are not evidence that Amazon staffers experience suicidal episodes more often than other American workers, in or out of a warehouse—but they do offer a visceral, real-time glimpse of employees on the edge.
• In Jacksonville, Florida, in December 2017, an older woman said “she was going to go home and kill herself” because she was being fired, according to a sheriff’s report. A supervisor saw her crying and hitting her head against a wall a couple times because she was being dismissed, and “did not have anything to live for.” She told a sheriff’s officer that she planned to cut her wrist with a butter knife, and previously had suicidal thoughts.
• In June 2018, police officers were sent to a warehouse in Shakopee, Minnesota, to help with a suicidal employee. The officers found the woman crying in the first aid office where she admitted that she wanted to kill herself, the police report says. “She mentioned wanting to use box cutters,” police wrote.
• At a warehouse in Etna, Ohio, in July 2018, a young man said, “With all the demands his employer has placed on him and things he's dealing with in life [sic] is becoming too much and considering hurting himself,” a sheriff’s report says. The worker has been “with Amazon for over a year and is frustrated with his employment because he felt he was lied to by Amazon at his orientation. He keeps saying the company told him they valued his employment and would be treated as if he mattered and not just a number,” the report adds.
“It’s this isolating colony of hell where people having breakdowns is a regular occurrence,” said Jace Crouch, a former employee at a warehouse in Lakeland, Florida, who had an emotional crisis on the job. It’s “mentally taxing to do the same task super fast for 10-hour shifts, four or five days a week.”
Some employees told The Daily Beast that they struggled with mental health issues before they began working for Amazon. But they believed the exacting work environment made them worse. And in some cases, after they were put on leave, they said they struggled to obtain promised compensation, received counseling they found insufficient or unaffordable, or were even fired.
In a statement to The Daily Beast, Amazon said it values the health of its employees and suggested that the number of calls is an “overgeneralization” that “doesn’t take into account the total of our associate population, hours worked, or our growing network.”
“The physical and mental well-being of our associates is our top priority, and we are proud of both our efforts and overall success in this area,” the statement said.
“We provide comprehensive medical care starting on day one so employees have access to the care when they need it most, 24-hour a day free and confidential counseling services, and various leave and medical accommodation options covering both mental and physical health concerns.”
“Crack the whip, crack the whip”
The bins came one after another.
It was Nick Veasley’s job to count the items in each one and check the tally against a computer screen to make sure it matched Amazon’s inventory. As soon as he was done, a robot would place another bin in front him—and that’s how it went all night at the warehouse in Etna, Ohio.
Sometimes Veasley, 41, had to hop up a stepstool to count. sometimes he had to bend over, aggravating his knees and back. Either way, he had to count fast—hundreds of pieces an hour—or a manager tracking his progress in real time would prod him to hurry up. He only occasionally talked to coworkers, knowing a supervisor could track the impromptu break, and the warehouse was nearly silent, aside from the shuffling feet of coworkers and the sliding of bins.
The work was at once stressful and boring, so Veasley’s mind wandered: to the water and electric bills he couldn’t pay, the rent checks he owed, to the fiancée and daughter who depended on him. On Saturday, Feb. 10, 2018, his thoughts took a dark turn: Killing himself might be a way out, from his problems and what he saw as the relentless pressure of his job.
It wasn’t the first time Veasley had thought about suicide. On his way to work that night, according to a police report, he’d wanted to drive his car off a cliff.
When Veasley started working at Amazon in December 2016, he said, he was thrilled to land the $14.50-an-hour job. “The job was a big deal,” he said. “It was good money, good benefits.”
But standing on his feet all day took a toll. His ankle started to hurt—badly. In February 2017 he went on medical leave for surgery, Amazon said. A snafu with the third party handling his paperwork cost him thousands in income, he said, and he fell behind on his bills. (Amazon disputes this, saying he was paid for his leave.)
“They were wanting money and things started getting shut off,” he said. “I was getting three-day notices on my door and my landlord saying pay this or get out.”
That’s when Veasley first began having suicidal thoughts. After he returned to Amazon in August 2017, it only got worse. The isolation, boredom, stress, and effort to recover leave pay plunged him deeper into depression, he said.
“I had so much on my mind that the quietness of standing in one spot and doing my job, would just let my mind run,” he said.
When Veasley spoke to human resources about how he was feeling, they seemed compassionate, he said. He was allowed to take a two-month leave, which came with a reduction in pay.
His second return to work, that winter, was no easier. “The quota, the boringness, everything,” he said. Managers, he said, acted as enforcers. “Do that, do this, do this,” he said. “Crack the whip, crack the whip, crack the whip.”
Another pressure point: Veasley suffers from irritable bowel syndrome and an intestinal disease called diverticulitis, which he said forced him to take frequent bathroom breaks to relieve pain.
He received two write-ups and was told that another violation could result in suspension or termination, he said. (Amazon called his account “highly unlikely,” saying managers work with HR to have a thorough conversation about “barriers” that lead associates to “accrue time off task.”) “Usually I can get myself out of a problem but I couldn’t do it working at Amazon,” Veasley said. “I felt like I had a thousand pounds wrapped around my ankle and it kept dragging me down and down and down, and there was no way out.”
After he told a guard about wanting to drive his car off a cliff, police were called and Veasley was taken to nearby Licking Memorial Hospital and then psychiatric ward, where he spent three days, he said. He blames Amazon for the ordeal.
“That place screwed me up so much it put me into a depression where I was actually on a 72-hour hold in a psych ward,” he said.
Amazon said it was “unfortunate” that Veasley feels that way. “Many employees will tell you they love their jobs and working in fulfillment centers,” it said in a statement.
It said performance goals are standard in the industry and that “we support people who are not performing to the levels expected with dedicated coaching to help them improve.”
“As we would with any associate in need, we supported and attempted to help Nick get the treatment and support he needed and requested. We accommodated his requests, directly engaged with him to understand his needs, provided resources, including outside and emergent crisis intervention help to him. Even though in the end it did not work out for Nick at Amazon, we hope he has found success in his pursuits,” Amazon added.
“They treat us like robots”
Caller: Hi this is Greg, Loss Prevention Specialist with Amazon, calling to report that we have a suicidal person...
Operator: OK what’s he said that’s made him suicidal?
Caller: His initial utterance is that he’d had thoughts of killing himself, he’s expressed two different plans that crossed his mind. One would be to go to a second or third story and throw himself off a balcony and he has also attempted and or thought of a plan of cutting his wrists.
The Daily Beast spoke to six current or former Amazon employees who had mental-health crises that required emergency assistance at the warehouse. They said much of their at-work stress stemmed from the performance quota.
A former employee in Etna, Ohio, said that it was sometimes physically impossible to stay on pace. “Even if it isn’t your fault, they ignore any explanation that you could give.”
He was constantly fearful that he would receive citations for falling short. “Once you have enough write-ups, you’re out the door,” he said. “There goes your livelihood.”
“There was a constant sense of, ‘did I screw that up, did I screw that up, did I screw that up?” he said. “[It] stays with you and almost becomes a permanent anxiety.”
“They treat us like robots,” said another employee, who was on leave after making a threat of suicide at a warehouse in Lebanon, Tennessee.
Some workers cited a stringent break policy. Managers flagged any lull in performance longer than a handful of minutes, Veasley said. Former employees who worked 12-hour shifts said they received two 30-minute breaks and a 15-minute break. But just walking across the massive warehouse ate up chunks of free time.
Crouch said he has struggled with depression for much of his life, which continued at Amazon. “It made it really hard for me to deal with that dehumanization at work,” he said. “I would come home, not talk to anyone, sit in bed, and cry.”
To be sure, not all the incidents at Amazon facilities were triggered by work-related issues.
A young woman who worked at the Jacksonville warehouse told a co-worker in February 2018 that she was suicidal over the loss of a friend.
An employee who had “multiple thoughts of killing himself throughout the day,” according to an August 2015 police report in Lakeland, told The Daily Beast that “nothing about Amazon was stressing me out.”
In some cases, emergency workers were called to Amazon facilities for people who were not workers. In September 2016, police went to a warehouse in Bellevue, Washington, to assist with an employee’s suicidal fiancée, who had used a saw to cut her leg, according to police.
“They need to interact to feel human”
The details in the emergency calls and police reports follow a long series of reports about conditions in Amazon warehouses that can only be described as hellish.
A British journalist who went undercover described a clock-watching culture so extreme that some employees urinated in bottles rather than trek to restrooms and risk being marked AWOL—which Amazon denies.
Amazon retrofit warehouses with air conditioning after a Pennsylvania newspaper reported in 2011 that temperatures at one facility would reach 100 degrees and that paramedics were stationed outside during heat waves.
The company’s anti-theft and security screening procedures mean long lines before some workers can clock in. A lawsuit over the unpaid waiting time ended up before the U.S. Supreme Court, which sided with Amazon.
There are myriad reports of workers being injured on the job. Two dozen employees were hospitalized last year when a can of bear repellent spewed toxic fumes in a warehouse. it was at least the third such incident in three years.
Scholars and researchers who study the effect of work on mental health declined to discuss Amazon’s employment practices. But many of the conditions cited by Amazon workers with suicide incidents were mentioned by the experts, who said a pressure cooker environment and mental illness can be dangerously toxic combination.
“High levels of workplace stressors can be bad for pre-existing mental-health conditions and can exacerbate them,” said Naomi Swanson, a lead researcher at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, adding that research in the area was scarce.
A workplace that asks a lot from employees but does not offer leeway in how they complete their tasks can be unhealthy.
“If you’re doing something that is just too hard for you, you can’t do it worried about your performance. That would be stressful, leading to mood disorders and anxiety disorders,” said William Eaton, a professor at the Johns Hopkins’ school of public health.
Working in social isolation is another red flag. People need social contact, said Ron Goetzel, another Johns Hopkins professor. “They need to interact to feel human.”
But researchers also agree that mental-health disorders and suicidal behavior are complex.
“You’ve got individuals who experience stress from a variety of sources,” said Yeates Conwell, a professor at the University of Rochester Center for Study and Prevention of Suicide. “The workplace may be one in which those things come together and get expressed as stress, mental illness, suicidal ideation behavior.”
“He started going into a dark place”
Like Nick Veasley, Jonathan Forrest was elated when Amazon offered him a job in the same warehouse. “Half nervous but mostly excited to start a new journey in life!” Forrest, then 36, posted on Facebook in the fall of 2016.
He was a picker, charged with putting items in bins.
“The board at Amazon showed the top 10 pickers of my shift and of well over 100 pickers, I ranked #8,” he wrote on Facebook a few weeks after he began. “At least there’s 1 thing to make me feel proud of myself.”
At $17.50 per hour, Forrest was making more money than he ever did before, and was paying down $7,000 in veterinary school debt, his father Butch Forrest said. But a few months in, he began to sour on his job and the company.
“I would like to thank one of the worlds [sic] richest men, multi billionaire Jeff Bezos, for the opportunity to win this overly generous $1 vending machine coupon to use in the Amazon cafeteria as a reward for my hard work today,” Forrest posted in late-January of 2017. “I’m confident that the free snickers bar I consume tomorrow will help further compel me to keep being the best picker that I can be!”
In April, he posted: “After this next week is over, I will have worked 280 hours in 5 weeks...I am ready to stop, take some time to enjoy myself and not work so much, what does my work do????? Mandatory fucking overtime! Seriously???? I am so pissed off right now.” It ended with this plea: “Leave me alone Amazon.”
“He started going into a dark place,” said Donnie Sanford, a close friend.
That summer, Forrest mentioned having suicidal thoughts to a coworker at Amazon and qualified for medical leave, his father said. Forrest saw a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with bipolar disorder and prescribed medication, according to documents reviewed by The Daily Beast.
Forrest returned to work after about a month, his father said, but on Oct. 28, he made another suicidal comment at work. This time an Amazon employee called the police. “Jonathan stated that he has had thoughts of suicide or self harm for several years and that the thoughts have been escalating in recent weeks,” a police report said. “Jonathan stated that he has attempted suicide in the past and that if he ever did commit suicide, it would be a ‘spur of the moment’ event,” the report added. (Butch Forrest and Sanford confirmed that Jonathan had attempted suicide before.)
Forrest was taken to the hospital for evaluation, and Amazon allowed him to return to work.
In the last weeks of 2017, Forrest’s mental health deteriorated again. “It seemed like the spark died out in him,” Sanford said. “He didn’t do much toward the end except work. It was pretty much all he had to talk about.”
On Jan. 2, 2018, Sanford received a text message from Forrest: “Just remember I love you.” Around the same time, while sitting down to brunch at a diner, Butch and Jane Forrest received a call from their son, Brian, who told them Jonathan had just posted a suicide note on Facebook. It said: “Sorry y’all. It was inevitably going to happen anyways. I just fired a pistol through the back of my head. Love you all.”
Butch Forrest says his son was struggling on many levels, but he believes his work at Amazon was a major factor in his suicide. “When it came to holidays it would be five days in a row,” he said. “It killed him.”
In a statement, Amazon said Forrest’s death “was a very sad situation and shocking for the team, who very much wanted to see Johnathan [sic] get better.”
“It’s always sad when we lose a member of our team for any reason and our thoughts continue to go out to Johnathan’s family. We encourage anyone who is having suicidal thoughts to call the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-8255. Amazon employees should know we have resources available as well,” the company said.
“I didn’t have the money to go to the doctor”
Of the six current or former Amazon workers who spoke to The Daily Beast, five were put on leave from work. They said they struggled to obtain promised compensation, found counseling was insufficient or unaffordable, and in some cases they were fired.
After being removed from Amazon by emergency responders—a situation some found humiliating—workers were often put on short-term medical or disability leave, entitling them to 60 percent of their pay and a return to their job after psychiatric clearance.
While on leave, some workers used the company’s employee assistance program, which includes three phone conversations with a counselor, and also sought outside psychiatric help. Even with Amazon-provided health insurance, the costs were often a financial strain.
“The frustrating part was I didn’t have the money to go to the doctor to get the paperwork they need,” said Crouch, the Lakeland, Florida, employee.
Veasley said he attempted to keep his job after leaving the psych ward but was told he had been fired for exceeding the maximum unpaid time off. He said he used many of those hours to go to therapy or doctor’s appointments.
Amazon said in a statement that it could not verify that Veasley used the time off for medical reasons. “Nicholas provided miscellaneous and inconsistent reasons for missing work and was often not able to provide the appropriate medical information needed for a fair excusal,” it said.
“Our teams work diligently to be fair to all employees and time excusal is provided often for employees during times of hardship when they have demonstrated regular attendance and reliability. Because we care about Nicholas, we wanted to help him but could not.”
But Veasley, who now works as a cook, is still angry about how he was treated.
“Amazon—don’t get me wrong—they throw up a lot of sparkly stuff in front of your eyes. Ooh, benefits, great pay, job security, this that and other, ” he said.
“But if you don’t read the fine print down at the bottom of this contract, you’re screwed.”

Amazon, Starbucks, Google, Apple, Boots, Caffe Nero, travel operator Tui ... the list of companies named in the debate over tax avoidance grows ever longer. So where can shoppers spend their hard-earned money and know that the company isn't funnelling the cash offshore and paying virtually no corporation tax? Figures prepared for Guardian Money by Ethical Consumer magazine reveal where you can shop with confidence.
Top of its list is Lush, the high street hand-made cosmetics chain and multinational with operations in more than 40 countries. Yet it has chosen not to use devices such as tax havens and ""transfer pricing"" to hide profits. Researchers at Ethical Consumer found that it paid 42% tax on its £21m profits in the UK last year, giving £8.9m to the Treasury. Amazon, meanwhile, revealed to the Commons public accounts committee last month that it had sales in the UK of £2.9bn, yet paid just £1.8m in tax.
If Amazon enjoys the same level of profit margin as Lush, and paid tax at the same rate, then Amazon would be handing over nearly £100m a year to the Treasury – enough to build five secondary schools.
Other store chains scoring highly in Ethical Consumer's research were John Lewis, which paid 35% tax on its profits last year, Marks & Spencer (27%), Next (26%) and Debenhams (22%). Ethical Consumer examined the percentage of actual tax paid on profits and only included companies that did not have ""high risk"" subsidiaries in tax havens.
Lush co-founder and managing director Mark Constantine accuses Amazon of operating a legal but ""basically corrupt business model"" and reveals how top business people, like himself, are repeatedly touted complex schemes to skirt taxes, such as running profits through Ireland or Luxembourg. ""I could spend all day in meetings with accountants and tax experts who show you how you can pay less. In one year, one of our competitors paid just 2%. But it just doesn't feel right.""
He says tax avoidance in Britain has become such a part of boardroom culture that executives are focusing on these schemes and taking their eye off the main job – running their businesses.
""We are big in Japan and have a lot of Japanese staff. There, they absolutely refuse to fiddle their taxes. From the bottom of the company to the top, the staff would absolutely refuse to do it. What we need here is a return to a climate where businesses are not focussed on strange machinations to avoid tax but, instead, on the important things that make you a commercial success.""
But the government needs to take the lead, he says. ""It has to set the rules and vigorously enforce them. In some ways, I'm embarrassed that our business came top in the Ethical Consumer survey. Other businesses probably think we're stupid. We even looked at taking the tax rates paid by all of our competitors over five years, averaging that out and paying 10% more. But even that would have involved us in schemes we didn't want to get into. It's the government that's got to get a lot more vigorous.""
But shoppers don't have to wait for the government to act – many have already begun their personal boycotts. Margaret Hodge MP was so angered by Amazon's aggressive policies that she has already publicly declared that from now on she will stop using it. A poll that ran on the Guardian's website earlier this week asked readers if they would be boycotting Amazon this Christmas: 53% said they would, but 47% said no. Typical of the comments from those people against was: ""Blame the government for not legislating against tax evasion. Don't blame the companies for saving money.""
Today Ethical Consumer, an independent co-operative that produces guides, ratings and best-buy advice, is launching a broader ""Boycott Amazon"" campaign. Tim Hunt, who calculated the figures on tax for Guardian Money says: ""With this research we hope to give consumers some better options. What we have produced is by no means a definitive list. For example, there will be many small independent retailers paying the proper amount of tax who deserve recognition. However, we wanted to produce a list of widely available brands to make it as easy as possible for consumers to avoid using Amazon.
""Over the past few weeks and months there has been an increasing demand to find alternatives. People are rightly angry and are looking to shop with retailers, both online and on the high street, that pay their fair share.
""The companies we are recommending are paying a much higher rate of tax on their profits than Amazon, and contributing a more proper amount to the public purse. During this time of swingeing public service cuts, we feel that this is vitally important as every penny counts.""
But what of the hundreds of traders that use Amazon Marketplace? Amazon is just a platform on which they sell their goods, and many have voiced serious concerns about losing business from a boycott, even though they pay their fair share of taxes. Ethical Consumer says: ""There's no reason why tax-paying traders should take a hit from our boycott. If you see an item on Amazon that you'd like to buy, simply find the name of the company online and then go to the company's website and buy directly.""

Amazon.com says wide variety of titles among 57,310 books removed from global rankings.
Seattle Times business reporter
Amazon.com released a statement this afternoon seeking to explain why thousands of books — including many gay- and lesbian-themed titles — were removed from its sales rankings over the weekend.
""This is an embarrassing and ham-fisted cataloging error for a company that prides itself on offering complete selection,"" said Drew Herdener, the Seattle company's communications director.
""It has been misreported that the issue was limited to Gay & Lesbian themed titles — in fact, it impacted 57,310 books in a number of broad categories such as Health, Mind & Body, Reproductive & Sexual Medicine, and Erotica. This problem impacted books not just in the United States but globally. It affected not just sales rank but also had the effect of removing books from Amazon's main product search.""
Amazon previously blamed a ""glitch,"" which seemed to intensify anger among some gay and lesbian activists who suspected homophobic censorship.
Books without sales rankings are still listed on Amazon.com but deleted from its best-seller lists, reducing the chances that they'll come to the attention of someone browsing the Web site for popular titles.
Neil Giuliano, president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation in New York, released a statement earlier today saying it contacted Amazon and was led to believe the deletions were a mistake.
""We expect to start seeing evidence of its correction immediately, and any loss of visibility of gay-themed books as a result of this error will be made right by Amazon,"" Giuliano said. ""It is so important that stories about the lives of our community are available, and that companies like Amazon promote these titles in equal fashion.""

Jeff Bezos introducing Amazon products in 2012. As The Washington Post’s owner, he can be counted on to think unpredictably, with a zeal for disruption and for tinkering until he gets things right.

EARLY employees of Amazon still remember the day the company took away their aspirin.
It was late 1999. After years of heady excess, the Internet boom was beginning to falter. Amazon, among the most celebrated of the dot-coms, was burdened with debt and spiraling losses. Jeff Bezos, its founder and chief impresario, had to impress Wall Street that he was serious about cutting costs.
But how? Amazon had never indulged employees with Silicon Valley perks like massages or sushi chefs. Just about the only thing that workers received free was aspirin. So the aspirin went.
The removal created a lot of muttering, but the cost-cutting — including layoffs — and promises of future profit helped Amazon escape the jaws of doom. Now, 14 years later, Mr. Bezos, 49, has become so rich and successful that he can surprise the world by buying The Washington Post for the equivalent of pocket change, which in his case is $250 million.
No one, apparently including Mr. Bezos himself, seems to know what he intends to do with that fabled newspaper. This is, after all, a man who once said the quality he most wanted in a wife was the ability to spring him from a third-world prison. He can probably be counted on to think unpredictably.
The aspirin take-away and similar incidents over the course of Mr. Bezos’ career show a determination to do whatever is necessary to succeed and a fanatic attention to detail, even at the expense of appearing ridiculous. Also, he does not care about your headache.
“Jeff may be outwardly goofy, with that trademark laugh, but he’s a very tough guy,” said James Marcus, who was Amazon employee No. 55. “If he goes even halfway through with his much-vaunted reinvention of journalism, there is no way he’s not going to break some eggs.”
Mr. Bezos is the sole founder, the public face, the largest shareholder and the visionary of Amazon. “For many of us, creating Earth’s biggest bookstore would have been enough,” said Kerry Fried, employee No. 251. “Jeff’s goal was a touch grander: to conquer the world.”
He has more than his share of detractors — just ask your neighborhood bookseller, if you can find one. But it is increasingly hard to dispute that he is the natural heir of Steve Jobs as the entrepreneur with the most effect on the way people live now.
Amazon, which is as much a reflection of Mr. Bezos’ personality as a corporation worth $125 billion can be, is by far the fastest-growing major retailer, although that simple label long ago ceased to suffice. It is also a movie studio, an art gallery (a 1962 Picasso, “Jacqueline au Chapeau Noir,” can be had for $175,000) and a publisher. It is an empire that spans much of the globe and even has its own currency, Amazon Coins. What it does not have much of, and never did, are old-fashioned profits.
The company has all sorts of regulatory and competitive concerns, making for a minefield of possible conflicts of interest for the owner of The Post. Amazon has opposed states’ efforts to have e-commerce companies collect sales tax. It was the main beneficiary of the Justice Department’s successful pursuit of five publishers and Apple on antitrust grounds. It is locking horns with major companies like Walmart and I.B.M. And as it expands into same-day delivery of its products, it will come up against grocery chains and drugstores.
Through its thriving data storage division, Amazon is becoming an important contractor to the government bureaucracy that is a mainstay of The Post’s reporting. If persistent rumors are true and the company produces an Amazon phone, yet another set of antagonists will arise.
Other newspaper publishers have similar, if fewer, conflicts. The Washington Post Company owns Kaplan, the for-profit education business that came under Congressional scrutiny, and the company fought efforts to impose regulations. But the newspaper nonetheless maintained its commitment to investigative journalism. Some argue that it would to take more than a change of ownership to transform that culture.
“Newsrooms are very conservative,” said Bill Buzenberg, executive director for the Center for Public Integrity. “They have difficulty changing and certainly they have difficulty selling out their core principles.”
Perhaps. But then, few newsrooms have ever been confronted with a new owner whose zeal for disruption is matched by his obsession with tinkering until he gets it right. As Steve Yegge, a former employee, once put it, “He just makes ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies.” A relevant fact: Mr. Bezos originally thought of naming Amazon “Relentless.”
Mr. Marcus, now the executive editor of Harper’s Magazine, said it all made sense, kind of: “Bezos is fascinated by broken business models. And whatever else you think of newspapers, the business model is broken.”
THERE is a reason that not even the most imaginative press critics ever thought that Jeff Bezos might one day buy The Washington Post: he has never seemed much of a fan of journalism or journalists.
He gives interviews only when he has something to promote, and always stays on message. He likes his privacy. there are no “at home with” magazine features with him lounging with his wife, MacKenzie, and four children at his luxurious Seattle lakeside estate. Amazon’s quarterly earnings calls with analysts and journalists are festivals of vagueness.
Even a number as basic, and presumably impressive, as how many Kindle e-readers the company sells is never released. There are no bold signs on its growing Seattle headquarters complex to identify what is contained within. And there are fewer leaks out of Amazon than the National Security Agency.
The philanthropic Bill Gates, whose wife, Melinda, served on The Post’s board, might have been a more likely buyer. Mark Zuckerberg, who adopted Donald E. Graham, the Post Company’s chief executive, as a mentor, could have been plausible. When it turned out to be Mr. Bezos instead, no one minded admitting astonishment. Neither his managerial style nor his entrepreneurial success nor his passion for secrecy seem to necessarily transfer over to his newest possession.
“Every story you ever see about Amazon, it has that sentence: ‘An Amazon spokesman declined to comment,’ “ Mr. Marcus said.
Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.
Though indisputably one of the great marvels of the age, Amazon is a curious beast that offers few obvious lessons for how a newspaper like The Post might become profitable. Financial writers have noted that Apple makes more than twice as much money in a quarter than Amazon earned during the last decade. Last quarter, Amazon had a net loss of $7 million. But Wall Street loves Amazon anyway, despite its slim margins.
Amazon tends to give its profits directly to its customers. It sells to them at a discount, will often ship free and, if a customer wants to return an item, will refund the money before even receiving the return.
Sometimes it will even do more. Say you buy a book, and then decide it’s not for you. You tell Amazon you are returning it. You might get a message like this: “Keep this item and receive a refund! It’s on us!”
That’s a sure way to win friends and lose money. But Wall Street believes that the company will someday monetize tens of millions of customers — in other words, make a real profit each time it sells them something. Maybe next year. Or the year after. From the very beginning, Mr. Bezos has made Amazon an investment story about the company’s potential rather than its reality.
People who have worked closely with Mr. Bezos say he refuses to waste time on anything that isn’t directly about the customer. “That’s where his ego is,” one former colleague said.
As tech companies grow old and big, they strive to keep the energy and boldness of the start-up they once were. They almost always fail. Amazon is the exception. “If a new product was launching, sometimes the day would never end,” a former employee said. As an Amazon joke has it, work-life balance is for people who do not like their work.

Jeffrey P. Bezos is the founder of Amazon.com. He has spent his career relying on steady growth but says he is ready to push The Post to compete in a changing online world.
In Seattle, employees who are partly paid in stock have been rewarded with its 600 percent climb in the last five years. Out in the warehouses, where most of Amazon’s 90,000 employees work, starting pay is about $12 an hour and workers can quickly lose their jobs if they slow down.
It was so hot in Allentown, Pa., in May 2011 that some workers at the Amazon warehouse there collapsed. Another company with different attitudes might have installed air-conditioning, or simply sent workers home during heat spells. If Amazon did that, however, East Coast customers might not get their Jay-Z CDs or diapers or jars of heather honey as quickly as they expected.
So the company chose a different solution. It arranged to station ambulances and paramedics out front during five days of excessive heat, according to The Morning Call, the Pennsylvania newspaper that broke the story. Fifteen workers were taken to area hospitals after they fell, and as many as 30 more were treated by paramedics at the warehouse. Workers quoted by the paper said the heat index in the facility, a measure that includes humidity, was as high as 114 degrees. Amazon had little to say to the newspaper, even when it later installed air-conditioning.
It is unlikely that Mr. Bezos will treat The Post’s reporters the way he treated his warehouse workers.
“I don’t expect him to turn off the air-conditioning,” said Ken Doctor, an analyst at Outsell. But Mr. Doctor suggested that Mr. Bezos did have one particularly relevant area of expertise: gathering data and using it to figure out what consumers want. “The Washington Post has a major political news audience,” Mr. Doctor said. “Yet it hasn’t been able to segment that audience commercially.”
One other competency that Mr. Bezos has: money, and lots of it.
“There’s not a person in this world that can save the newspaper industry,” said Craig Huber, an independent research analyst. “He’s going to be dealing with operating losses as far as the eye can see. I think The Washington Post sold to him because he’s going to be more willing to absorb those losses.”
A CORE role for any newspaper is to cover the local government. For The Post, that includes the federal government. In recent years, however, Amazon has become a government contractor — in effect, the government’s digital filing cabinet.
Amazon Web Services, Mr. Bezos’ cloud computing operation, is a leading service for third-party rental of computing and data storage. Besides hundreds of thousands of individuals and businesses, more than 2,000 research institutions and 500 government institutions worldwide use A.W.S. Amazon runs several large data centers, each containing hundreds of thousands of servers, along with 42 smaller facilities around the world.
The operations of these data centers, like most other details about A.W.S., are a closely held secret. Even the company’s senior executives must have a valid reason to be inside one of the big facilities.
In addition to the eight major centers, A.W.S. operates a separate data center, called GovCloud, for the United States government. GovCloud is compliant with the government’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, controls. Only United States citizens can use these computers. Much other government work, for both the United States and foreign governments, is done in other A.W.S. centers as well.
In one important recent development, A.W.S. was awarded a contract valued at $600 million to provide computing services to the Central Intelligence Agency. James Staten, an analyst with Forrester Research, said the C.I.A. contract was a breakthrough for Amazon. “Every other national intelligence service will want the same kind of computing, if they can get it,” he said.
Every other cloud services company, meanwhile, wants a piece of the action. I.B.M. formally protested the award on undisclosed grounds. The Government Accountability Office, while finding generally for Amazon, said the C.I.A. should re-examine the deal. Amazon is expected to officially apply for the original award to stand.
Although Mr. Bezos, not Amazon, bought The Post, his role as Amazon’s chief executive and biggest shareholder makes for awkward relationships. Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security Studies, said, “It’s a serious potential conflict of interest for a major newspaper like The Washington Post to have a contractual relationship with the government and the most secret part of the government.”
But Steve Aftergood, director of the project on government secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, said that if The Washington Post did not publish a story about the C.I.A. because of Amazon’s business relationship with the agency, “there would be no shortage of other venues that would be eager to publish the information in question.”
Bob Woodward, The Post’s most famous reporter, said he first met Mr. Bezos at a Forstmann Little conference in Colorado about a decade ago and that they spoke “a number of times at those conferences and elsewhere.”
Mr. Woodward said that when he discussed projects and books with Mr. Bezos, “he always struck me as very serious about it and in tune with the values of independence, aggressiveness.” He added that he hoped that because Mr. Bezos ran a company that was “customer focused,” the entrepreneur would recognize how much readers appreciate high-quality reporting.
Mr. Bezos has made the right noises. Referring to a famous assertion that John N. Mitchell, President Nixon’s 1972 campaign director, directed at Katharine Graham, The Post’s publisher, the Amazon chief wrote in a letter to Post employees that “while I hope no one ever threatens to put one of my body parts through a wringer, if they do, thanks to Mrs. Graham’s example, I’ll be ready.”
Mr. Bezos’ critics, however, have been clamoring to put him through a wringer for years now. Leaving aside the complaints of bookstores, publishers and distributors, all groups whose viability he is challenging, two controversies seem to prefigure the sort of conflicts he will have as The Post’s new owner.
WikiLeaks briefly used Amazon Web Services in late 2010 to host its purloined classified documents, but then Amazon pulled the plug. The company said that contrary to news reports, it was not acting at the government’s request. Instead, it said it took WikiLeaks offline for violating Amazon’s rules against posting material you do not own. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said Amazon “ran away with its tail between its legs.”
A more recent complaint involves the opposite of the WikiLeaks situation. Ask.fm, a Web site for anonymous teenagers, is being pilloried in the British media for allowing cyberbullying that was blamed in the suicides of four youths. Amazon, which reportedly hosts Ask.fm, has been asked to take it down for violating its rules against hate speech. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment or even confirm that the company hosts Ask.fm.
LARGELY overlooked in the commentary over what Mr. Bezos will do with The Post is the fact that he has already commanded a large editorial team.
In the early days of Amazon, he set up a department to produce reviews of the books that Amazon was selling. It was an impressive gesture: Whoever heard of a store with editors? But it offered Amazon instant credibility. Mr. Bezos never suggested that the reviews be positive, and he gave the department his full support.
Until he did not. People at Amazon at the time describe a struggle between high-minded reviewers and data-driven M.B.A.’s, otherwise known as the Vulcans in a tribute to Mr. Bezos’ favorite television show. The Vulcans pointed out that relatively few customers actually read the reviews, so maybe Amazon shouldn’t spend so much to produce them.
“It was a culture war and the Vulcans won,” said Tim Appelo, who worked in the editorial department. “Many people in Amazon editorial were embittered because Bezos scuttled us.”
The professional reviews yielded to the innovation of customer reviews — sometimes an impartial evaluation, sometimes a love song by the author’s mother disguised as an impartial evaluation. There was no way to tell, and no one in management seemed to care. Many of the reviewers quit or were laid off.
Mr. Appelo was not bitter. In fact, he went back to Amazon for a second stint, introducing its digital video store in 2006. (He is now at The Hollywood Reporter.)
“Bezos knows that there is a difference between the marketplace and the marketplace of ideas,” Mr. Appelo said. “He is relentlessly and ruthlessly inventive but I don’t think he’ll indulge his Vulcan side too much.”
Put like that, it sounds somewhere between a gut feeling and a heartfelt wish. In these troubled times for newspapers, that may be the most The Washington Post can expect.

A distressed Amazon employee sent out an email to hundreds of co-workers criticizing the company before leaping off its Seattle headquarters in a failed suicide attempt.
The unidentified worker, who had been placed on an “employee improvement plan,” jumped off the 12-story building in the downtown area Monday morning and survived the fall, Bloomberg Technology reported.
Before taking the plunge, the worker sent out a mass email to Amazon employees, including CEO Jeff Bezos, saying how he was displeased with the company’s recent handling of his transfer request, according to the news site, citing an anonymous source.
In the email, the man also hinted that he might hurt himself.
“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.”"ÿÿAmazon employee jumps off company building after ranting email to staff

Media captionAmazon's Andrew Cecil was condemned by MPs for failing to answer questions
Executives from some of the world's most-recognised firms have been grilled by MPs on the issue of tax avoidance.
The head of Google UK and top managers from Starbucks and Amazon appeared before the Public Accounts Committee.
Starbucks admitted the Dutch government had granted a special tax deal on its European headquarters, which receives royalty payments from its UK business.
Amazon and Google also confirmed they used favourable European tax jurisdictions for their UK businesses.
Amazon's sales are handled out of Luxembourg, while Google's advertising space is sold by a team in the Republic of Ireland, the executives confirmed.
Margaret Hodge, who chairs the parliamentary committee, told the BBC that she thought it was right for customers to boycott the three companies.
""One of our concerns is that the ability of global companies to choose where to they put their costs and their profits gives them an unfair tax advantage that damages UK-based businesses,"" she said.
No analysis
Starbucks has reported a taxable profit only once in its 15 years of operating in the UK.
""We're not at all pleased about our financial performance here,"" the coffee chain's chief financial officer Troy Alstead told the committee. ""The most competitive coffee and espresso market we face is here in the UK.""
A four-month investigation by news agency Reuters revealed that Starbucks reportedly paid just £8.6m in corporation tax in the UK over 14 years - including reporting accounting losses when it was profitable.
Ms Hodge questioned why the company even continued to do business in the UK, if it was making such perennial losses.
The taxable profits of its UK business are calculated net of the royalty paid to its Netherlands regional headquarters.
Mr Alstead said that these royalties were subject to a combined tax rate in the Netherlands and the US of approximately 16%. The UK's main corporation tax rate is 24%.
Starbucks' royalty rate used to be 6% of sales, but was recently reduced to 4.7% after being challenged by the UK tax authorities.
The chief financial officer said the 6% royalty rate was paid by its businesses in other countries, including by independent licensees in 20 countries.
He said the royalty reflected costs incurred by the business outside the UK - including new products, store layout design, new machinery development and engineering services.
However, when challenged by the committee, he admitted that there was no detailed analysis of costs behind the 6% figure.
He denied that the Netherlands had been chosen as the company's regional headquarters because of its favourable tax rate, saying it was because the company had a major roasting plant located there.
All of Starbucks' businesses worldwide, including in the UK, buy their coffee from its Switzerland office, Mr Alstom also said, which charged a 20% markup on the price at which it bought its coffee in the wholesale market. The Swiss office paid a 12% tax rate on its profits, he said.

Mr Alstom insisted that the company does not use any tax havens, and pays a high tax rate worldwide.
Luxembourg HQ
MPs expressed frustration with Amazon's director of public policy, Andrew Cecil, who repeatedly said he would have to come back at a later date with information requested by the committee.
The information included the value of Amazon's sales in the UK, the pre-tax profits of the European company and the ownership structure of the European company.
Mr Cecil explained that sales on the amazon.co.uk website - and in all other European countries - were actually made by its Luxembourg-based European business, which employs 500 people.
Amazon's UK business, which employs about 15,000 people to manage deliveries, warehousing and other aspects of the UK business, operates as a service provider to the European company.
As such, the profits on the mark-up on the sales price are booked by the Luxembourg company.
Mr Cecil said that the Luxembourg business's turnover in 2011 was 9.1bn euros. It paid taxes of 8m euros and posted after-tax profits of 20m euros.
He said that Amazon had never publicly disclosed the country-by-country breakdown of its European sales.
According to a report by the Guardian, Amazon generated sales of more than £3.3bn in the UK last year but paid no corporation tax on any of the profits, and is under investigation by the UK tax authorities.
Mr Cecil confirmed that the company had received a 200m-euro payment demand from the French tax authorities, but refused to divulge whether any other countries were investigating the company's tax dealings.
Tax haven
Like Amazon, Google also operates its European business out of a favourable tax jurisdiction - in its case the Republic of Ireland - according to Matt Brittin, who runs company's northern European businesses.
He openly admitted that the choice of Ireland was due to its favourable 12.5% corporation tax rate.
He also confirmed that the rights to the company's non-US intellectual property rights were owned in the tax haven of Bermuda, saying that the company had a duty to shareholders to minimise its costs.
He further freely accepted that until recently, the Ireland company was paying a fee to a separate Dutch company within Google, purely for the purpose of reducing its taxes.
Like the other executives, Mr Brittin insisted that nothing his employer did was illegal, prompting the committee chair, Ms Hodge, to say: ""We're not accusing you of being illegal, we're accusing you of being immoral.""
Google's UK unit paid just £6m to the Treasury in 2011 on UK turnover of £395m, according to the Telegraph.
Google earns revenues in the UK when users of its UK search website click on links that business customers have paid Google to list at the top of the results for particular search terms.
Mr Brittin said this advertising space was sold by a team of 3,000 salespeople in its Ireland office - of which 200 deal with UK business customers.
However, he also admitted that the company employed 700 marketing consultants in the UK who, among other things, would refer clients to the Ireland sales team.
The executive insisted that the primary value provided by the company in the UK was not the sale of advertising space, but provided by its 17,000 engineers in California that creates the company's innovative technology - such as its search engine, mapping and translation services - which are mostly provided for free."ÿÿFirms grilled over tax avoidance

NEW YORK – World Jewish Congress CEO Robert Singer on Thursday thanked Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos for removing several Holocaust-denial books flagged by the WJC on multiple occasions since 2013, and as recently as earlier this month, as being in violation of Amazon’s guidelines prohibiting the sale of material that “promote or glorify hatred.” In a letter to Bezos, Singer offered the WJC’s assistance in helping to identify and flag other offensive material in similar violation of Amazon’s standards.
“On behalf of the more than 100 Jewish communities affiliated with the World Jewish Congress, I want to thank you and the staff at Amazon for removing the three Holocaust-denial books that my organization brought to your attention in a series of recent letters, and again in my article in the Los Angeles Times earlier this month,” wrote Singer in the letter to Bezos.
“The three titles that you removed - Holocaust: The Greatest Lie Ever Told, by Eleanor Wittakers. The Hoax of the Twentieth Century: The Case Against the Presumed Extermination of European Jewry, by Arthur R Butz. and Did Six Million Really Die? by Richard Harwood – are blatantly anti-Semitic works penned by some of the most notorious bigots of our time, and we commend you for recognizing the potential harm of enabling their accessibility on Amazon.
“We are also gratified to note that Amazon has removed numerous other Holocaust-denying items from its website. It is encouraging to know that Amazon is endeavouring to enforce its own standards and guidelines prohibiting the sale of material that “promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance.”
“The World Jewish Congress stands ready to assist you in every way possible to identify and flag other offensive material that similarly violate Amazon’s guidelines, and ensure their quick removal from the website. We would welcome the opportunity to meet with you or one of your colleagues to discuss this matter further,” the letter concluded.

Amazon’s plans to expand into Long Island City may cost Mayor Bill de Blasio — and New York City — approximately 1,500 units of affordable housing.
Two sites that will house the future offices of the e-commerce giant were originally intended for residential development, before Amazon chose them in a nationwide contest for its new headquarters.
Story Continued Below
Most — if not all — of that intended housing is now off the table.
“The fact that massive public subsidies are helping eliminate affordable housing units is just the latest reason this bad deal needs to be torn up and thrown away,” said state Sen. Michael Gianaris, who represents Long Island City.
Plaxall, which owns land around the Anable Basin, was prepared to ask New York City for permission to build up to 4,995 new homes on a 14.7-acre site on the East River, 1,250 of which developers would have set aside for low- and middle-income New Yorkers. Most of that site will now be subsumed into Amazon’s office campus.
A small portion of it — about two acres — can still be used for housing because it won’t be part of Amazon’s campus. But Plaxall hasn’t decided if it wants apartments or office space there, and either way, it won’t be able to accommodate nearly as many homes as originally planned.
Meanwhile, another developer, TF Cornerstone, was poised to build 1,000 apartments on a neighboring site owned by the city’s Economic Development Corporation, of which 250 units would have been affordable. That site, too, will be part of Amazon’s office campus.
A spokesman for Amazon confirmed there will be no housing in its Long Island City complex.
One of de Blasio’s primary goals as mayor is to build and preserve 300,000 homes for people of limited means. He recently pointed to that housing plan when asked if Amazon would strain New York City’s housing market, like the tech sector has strained San Francisco’s.
""The absolute difference between us and San Francisco is we believe in economic diversity, we believe in ensuring there's a vast supply of affordable housing,"" he said.
Affordable housing, however, is no longer the main focus of development in Anable Basin.
The New York City Economic Development Corporation, which is helping shepherd the Amazon project, said the jobs and other amenities the company plans to bring will produce a net benefit for the area.
""Tackling the affordability crisis means building more affordable housing — but it also means creating more good-paying jobs,"" EDC spokesperson Stephanie Baez said. ""Development of commercial office space around Anable Basin will offset concerns about residential overdevelopment that have been expressed by some community residents.""
She said the plan will include other perks, like a workforce program and a public school.
On Thursday, TF Cornerstone circulated a job posting for a project manager for Amazon’s Long Island City campus, who will help build out “commercial development for Amazon along the Long Island City Waterfront.”
No salary is listed.
“The more we learn about this deal, the worse it gets,” Gianaris said."ÿÿAmazon deal will disrupt plans for affordable housing on Long Island City sites

Amazon.com.ca Inc. has changed its pricing practices in Canada and the U.S. and agreed to pay a $1-million penalty to settle a case of potentially misleading advertising being investigated by Canada’s Competition Bureau.
It will also pay $100,000 towards the Competition Bureau’s costs, according to the details of the settlement, released Wednesday.
The investigation, launched in 2015, looked at “list price” claims designed to make consumers think that products sold on Amazon.ca were cheaper than the same products at competing retailers.
The claims typically featured a higher price, struck out with a line, and the lower Amazon price underneath. The gimmick is widely used among Canadian retailers and the Amazon penalty is meant to send a clear message that unsubstantiated savings claims will not be tolerated, according to the bureau.
“At the heart of this case, it’s really about truth in advertising,” said Josephine Palumbo, the bureau’s deputy commissioner for deceptive marketing practices.
“We know that savings claims are a powerful tool.”
During the investigation, Amazon told the bureau that it relied on its suppliers to provide “list prices” without verifying that those prices were accurate.
Under the Competition Act, when comparisons are made between a regular price and a sale price, they must be true.
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...
Palumbo said Amazon provided full and timely co-operation and that was reflected in the amount of the penalty.
Amazon declined to comment.
Amazon has already made changes to the way it advertises list prices on its Canadian website to accurately represent the savings available to consumers, according to the bureau. The policies put in place by Amazon have also had an effect beyond the Canadian website, including on savings claims for products sold on Amazon.com.
The bureau is authorized to set fines of up to $10 million for violations of the Competition Act, although not for this particular type of offence, said Palumbo. The amount of the penalty depends on the targeted audience, how long the conduct has been going on and whether there is voluntary compliance.
In 2015, Michaels of Canada ULC agreed to pay a $3.5-million penalty following a Competition Bureau investigation into price advertising for custom and select ready-made framing.
Retail experts said it’s unlikely the new ruling will damage the Amazon brand.
“You never want to be the brand that is manipulating or attempting to manipulate a consumer,” said Arthur Fleischmann, partner and president of John St., an advertising and communications firm with retail clients.
“But I would say that today, and particularly anyone under the age of 50-55 who grew up in a highly digital world, most of us are quite savvy, so these things don’t particularly impact us because we all are aware of the grey area that business can run in, and we’re all savvy enough to do our own homework.”
Retailers are competing on price in this way because the North American consumer mindset is never to pay full price for anything, he added.

“We’re conditioned to buying on special now and now these expectations are set, so it becomes a bit of an addiction.”
John Gerzema, chairman and chief executive officer of BAV (BrandAsset Valuator) Consulting, said settling was the right choice for Amazon.
“This is an important settlement for Amazon to not just protect their business, but their brand: In our data ... Amazon is in the top 8 per cent of all Canadian brands on ‘trust’. This despite the fact that consumer trust in brands has declined by 50 per cent since 2008 and the financial crisis. This is an advantage they can’t afford to lose.”"ÿÿAmazon to pay $1M penalty over pricing practices in Canada | The Star

Amazon’s European workforce is fed up, so it’s taking action during the site’s biggest week of the year.
Spanish employees at the e-commerce giant launched a general strike on Tuesday that is expected to last through Prime Day next week. Workers in Italy, France, Germany, Poland and England are also taking part.
The strike is calling for “health and decent jobs,” along with benefits for all Amazon employees. They claim their “struggles against the abuses” of Amazon have gone ignored for too long.
Each nation has a particular grievance against Jeff Bezos’ behemoth.
* Polish workers say an anti-strike law has made it impossible to negotiate better salaries., * German employees have been fighting for a collective bargaining agreement for two years., * In Italy, Amazon routinely hires contract workers who aren’t required to have benefits., * Amazon’s Spanish leaders unilaterally imposed working conditions when a previous collective bargaining agreement expired., * England and France have imposed demanding measures on time and efficiency, meaning workers have to process 300 items an hour and pee in bottles. Workers were also penalized for taking sick days and time off during pregnancies.,
“In the rest of the world, Amazon is making history but hardly distributes its millions in profits,” the disgruntled workers write. “Only if we struggle together will we gain recognition for our demands. Only with a joint action at a European level will workers organize in those places where there is no union representation yet.”
”We don’t recognize these allegations as an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings,” an Amazon spokesperson told Observer.
Employees in Amazon’s Madrid fulfillment center organized a smaller strike in March, but with Prime Day on the horizon, they decided to increase the scale to the whole continent.
The workers are also pressuring customers to boycott Amazon until after Prime Day, to eat into the company’s bottom line.
“The idea is that if no concessions to the workers are made, that day will not take place,” the employees write.
It’s highly unlikely that will happen, since Prime Day is now bigger than Black Friday.
Last year Amazon customers ordered 34 million items on Prime Day—that’s 398 items per second, 18 percent higher than Amazon’s Black Friday average.
The striking workers won’t be able to cut into all that profit. But thanks to advocates on social media, they are making their voices heard.

There’s no indication that Amazon’s American workers are taking part in this effort, but they have plenty of complaints of their own.
A 2015 New York Times investigation found that employees were forced to work 80 hours a week and stay online constantly. Bosses often emailed workers past midnight, and then texted them if they didn’t get a response right away.
Since the initial report, an increasing number of Amazon employees have come forward about unfair treatment.
For example, last year a transgender woman sued the company, claiming she experienced repeated discrimination and harassment while she worked there. She was allegedly called “he/she” and “chick with a dick,” among other insults.
And Muslim workers recently protested an increased workload during Ramadan, reporting their bosses forced them to lift heavy boxes and work in hot conditions even though they were fasting.
Prime Day seems like a perfect time to air these grievances. Time will tell if Amazon’s angry American workers join their European counterparts."ÿÿEuropean Amazon Workers Strike and Urge Prime Day Boycott—Will the US Follow Suit?

Please do not buy from Amazon
Amazon has obtained a US patent (5,960,411) on an important and obvious idea for E-commerce: the idea that your command in a web browser to buy a certain item can carry along information about your identity. (This works by sending back a ""cookie"", a kind of ID code that your browser received previously from the same server.) Amazon has sued to block the use of this simple idea, showing that they truly intend to monopolize it. This is an attack against the World Wide Web and against E-commerce in general.
The idea in question is that a company can give you something which you can subsequently show them to identify yourself for credit. This is nothing new: a physical credit card does the same job, after all. But the US Patent Office issues patents on obvious and well-known ideas every day. Sometimes the result is a disaster.
Today Amazon is suing one large company. If this were just a dispute between two companies, it would not be an important public issue. But the patent gives Amazon the power over anyone who runs a web site in the US (and any other countries that give them similar patents)--power to control all use of this technique. Although only one company is being sued today, the issue affects the whole Internet.
Amazon is not alone at fault in what is happening. The US Patent Office is to blame for having very low standards, and US courts are to blame for endorsing them. And US patent law is to blame for authorizing patents on computational techniques and patterns of communication--a policy that is harmful in general. (See lpf.ai.mit.edu for more information about this issue.)
Foolish government policies gave Amazon the opportunity--but an opportunity is not an excuse. Amazon made the choice to obtain this patent, and the choice to use it in court for aggression. The ultimate moral responsibility for Amazon's actions lies with Amazon's executives.
We can hope that the court will find this patent is legally invalid, Whether they do so will depend on detailed facts and obscure technicalities. The patent uses piles of semirelevent detail to make this ""invention"" look like something subtle.
But we do not have to wait passively for the court to decide the freedom of E-commerce. There is something we can do right now: we can refuse to do business with Amazon. Please do not buy anything from Amazon until they promise to stop using this patent to threaten or restrict other web sites.
If you are the author of a book sold by Amazon, you can provide powerful help to this campaign by putting this text into the ""author comment"" about your book, on Amazon's web site. Please send mail to amazon@gnu.org when you do this, and please tell us what happens afterward.

Reply to Jason Fletcher (December 19, 1999)
Jason Fletcher wrote ('A Dissenting Opinion', see below in talkbacks):
I do not agree with RMS on this issue. First, I think he has misinterpreted the issue. Amazon did not patent cookies. Amazon did not patent the idea of cookies. They patented the idea of One-Click shopping.
That is essentially correct: Amazon did not patent cookies. The patent covers the technique needed to support one-click shopping (which is normally implemented using cookies).
It is precisely for trying to monopolize the feature of one-click shopping that I condemn Amazon, and ask you not to do buy from them.
From what I can tell, their claim rests on the strength of two procedural matters, NOT the underlying technology: (1) the reduction of overhead that might drive a customer away, and (2) the reduction of transmissions of sensitive information and thus providing smaller opportunity for information hijacking in transit.
These are the reasons why one-click shopping is a useful feature. They may be the reasons why Amazon wants a monopoly on the feature. they are definitely the reasons why I condemn Amazon for trying to grab that monopoly.
If the feature of one-click shopping were of no particular benefit, the issue would not be worth paying much attention to.
I chose not to name Barnes and Noble in my announcement because the identity of the current defendant is a side issue, and people should not get sidetracked by it. I have no particular sympathy for Barnes and Noble, and if they were sued for some other reason, I would be unlikely to take their side. The important thing about this patent is that it takes a bite out of your freedom and mine--not just that of Barnes and Noble.
I hope that we are wise enough to value our freedom, and stand up for it, undistracted by the fact that the first victim is a large company with no particular claim to our esteem.
Postscript added by Richard Stallman, December 21, 1999
Amazon's response to people who write about the patent contains a subtle misdirection which is worth analyzing:
The patent system is designed to encourage innovation, and we spent thousands of hours developing our 1-ClickÂ® shopping feature.
If they did spend thousands of hours, they surely did not spend it thinking of the general technique that the patent covers. So if they are telling the truth, what did they spend those hours doing?
Perhaps they spent some of the time writing the patent application. That task was surely harder than thinking of the technique. Or perhaps they are talking about the time it took designing, writing, testing, and perfecting the scripts and the web pages to handle one-click shopping. That was surely a substantial job. Looking carefully at their words, it seems the ""thousands of hours developing"" could include either of these two jobs.
But the issue here is not about the details in their particular scripts (which they do not release to us) and web pages (which are copyrighted anyway). The issue here is the general idea, and whether Amazon should have a monopoly on that idea.
Are you, or I, free to spend the necessary hours writing our own scripts, our own web pages, to provide one-click shopping? Even if we are selling something other than books, are we free to do this? That is the question. Amazon seeks to deny us that freedom, with the eager help of a misguided (or worse) US government.
When Amazon sends out cleverly misleading statements like the one quoted above, it demonstrates something important: they do care what the public thinks of their actions. They must care--they are a retailer. Public disgust can affect their profits.
People have pointed out that the problem of software patents is much bigger than Amazon, that other companies might have acted just the same, and that boycotting Amazon won't directly change patent law. Of course, these are all true. But that is no argument against this boycott!
If we mount the boycott strongly and lastingly, Amazon may eventually make a concession to end it. And even if they do not, the next company which has an outrageous software patent and considers suing someone will realize there can be a price to pay. They may have second thoughts.
The boycott can also indirectly help change patent law--by calling attention to the issue and spreading demand for change. And it is so easy to participate that there is no need to be deterred on that account. If you agree about the issue, why NOT boycott Amazon?
To help spread the word, please put a note about the boycott on your own personal web page, and make a link to http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/amazon.html. Updated information will be placed there."ÿÿLinux Today - UPDATED: Richard Stallman -

Business reporter Spencer Soper of The Morning Call has won the October Sidney Award from the Sidney Hillman foundation for his expose of Dickensian conditions in Amazon.com's warehouse in Pennsylvania.
Temperatures inside the ""fulfillment center"" soared to over 100 degrees over the summer and management refused to throw open the doors for ventilation. Current and former warehouse employees told Soper that they felt pressured to work themselves to the point of collapse because they feared they would be penalized for slowing down or taking time off. A security guard complained that he saw pregnant workers struggling in the heat.
During a heat wave, Amazon hired a private ambulance company to wait near the warehouse to deal with all the workers succumbing to heat-related illnesses, and a local ER doc complained to authorities about the influx of workers from the facility.
The Lehigh Valley warehouse is strategically positioned to be within a day's drive of most cities in the Eastern U.S. and Canada. So, if you live in the East and you've ordered something from Amazon lately, there's a good chance your purchase passed through this warehouse.
Amazon has issued a flurry of public statements and messages to customers since the story ran on Sept 18, but when Soper checked back with current employees for his Sep 23 follow-up story, they told him nothing had changed since his original story ran.

NEW YORK – Was it anti-gay bias? A computer glitch? A brilliant hack? Or an English-French translation error?
Whatever the reason, bloggers noticed Sunday that a lot of gay-themed books had suddenly lost their Sales Rank tags on Amazon.com, while titles dealing with straight sex had kept theirs.
""This is an embarrassing and ham-fisted cataloging error for a company that prides itself on offering complete selection,"" Amazon spokeswoman Patty Smith told FoxNews.com via e-mail.
Sales Rank is a line entry on each book's Amazon page stating where that title currently stands on the online retailer's best-seller list, which contains millions of books.
Authors are naturally concerned to see where their own books rank. publishers believe that high rankings spur more sales.
According to the Associated Press, books that lost their Sales Ranks included classics such as James Baldwin's ""Giovanni's Room,"" Gore Vidal's ""The City and the Pillar"" and Jeanette Winterson's ""Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit.""

Some people suspected a hidden agenda on Amazon's part. The company claimed Sunday it was a software error.
But on Monday, a well-known hacker and Internet ""troll"" claimed credit, saying it was a prank on his part.
And Mike Daisey, a former Amazon employee who's written about his time working there, said it was the result of an administrator on the French version of Amazon confusing the English words for ""adult"" and ""erotic.""
Smith's e-mail seemed to indicate something along the lines of Daisey's theory.
""It has been misreported that the issue was limited to Gay & Lesbian themed titles — in fact, it impacted 57,310 books in a number of broad categories such as Health, Mind & Body, Reproductive & Sexual Medicine, and Erotica,"" she wrote.
The ball got rolling early Sunday morning when Mark R. Probst, an author and publisher of gay-themed Young Adult titles, put up a blog posting detailing how ""hundreds"" of gay-interest titles had suddenly lost their Sales Ranks.
More blog postings went up in response, and by the end of the day Twitter feeds about ""#amazonfail"" were exploding.
""Thanks, Jeff Bezos, for proving homophobia & literary ignorance is alive & well at Amazon.com,"" tweeted New Yorker writer Susan Orlean, author of ""The Orchid Thief.""
Craig Seymour, author of the gay memoir ""All I Could Bare,"" wrote on his blog Sunday that his book's sales rank had been dropped in February, then restored nearly four weeks later, after he was told by Amazon that his book had been ""classified as an Adult product.""
Probst himself got a similar explanation when he queried Amazon privately in his capacity as a publisher.
""In consideration of our entire customer base, we exclude 'adult' material from appearing in some searches and best seller lists,"" went the reply. ""Since these lists are generated using sales ranks, adult materials must also be excluded from that feature.""
However, explicit titles dealing mainly with sex between different genders still kept their Sales Ranks, such as porn star Ron Jeremy's memoir ""The Hardest (Working) Man in Showbiz,"" former underage porn star Traci Lords' ""Underneath It All"" and ""The Big Book of Porn: A Penetrating Look at the World of Dirty Movies.""
Amazon had a different explanation later Sunday — that it had all been the result of a computer error.
""There was a glitch in our systems and it's being fixed,"" Smith e-mailed The Associated Press.
But then came a Monday blog posting by ""Weev,"" an Internet ""troll"" so obnoxious he's been profiled in the New York Times.
""I guess my game is up!"", he, or someone claiming to be him, wrote. ""Here's a nice piece I like to call 'how to cause moral outrage from the entire Internet in ten lines of code.'""
In offensive and witty detail, Weev explained how he'd become annoyed by Amazon's user-based reputation system, which lets ordinary people tells Amazon administrators about offensive content, and decided to screw with it.
He wrote some quick UNIX/Linux code (which he provides) to grab the URLs of thousands of gay-themed books listings on Amazon.
Then he enlisted, so he says, sympathetic administrators at other Web sites to embed the code in their own Web sites so people who clicked on those sites would actually be reporting various Amazon titles as ""offensive content"" without their own knowledge.
At the same time, Weev says, he hired ""third worlders"" to sign up for new Amazon accounts and send him the ""cookies"" identifying each unique user.
With all that information, he was then able to automatically flag hundreds of gay-themed books as offensive and so remove them from Amazon's Sales Rank.
Another blogger tested Weev's code and said it didn't work — but that had it been less buggy, it would have.
Meanwhile, Mike Daisey, theatrical monologuist and author of ""21 Dog Years"" about working at Amazon, says the Sales Rank yank was the result of a French employee of Amazon confusing the codes for ""adult,"" ""erotic"" and ""sexuality.""
That doesn't completely explain why books about straight pornography were unaffected, but Daisey says ""the Amazon [editing] system is mostly hand-built, and often super idiosyncratic, very Millennium Falcon meets Battlestar Galactica.""
Smith's account dovetailed with that theory.
""This problem impacted books not just in the United States, but globally,"" she wrote. ""It affected not just sales rank but also had the effect of removing the books from Amazon’s main product search.""
Some books had gotten their Sales Ranks restorted by midday Monday. Seymour's ""All I Could Bare"" had a Sales Rank, as did one edition of ""Giovanni's Room"" and Baldwin's equally gay-themed ""Another Country.""
But a more recent edition of ""Giovanni's Room"" did not, and neither did ""The City and the Pillar"" and ""Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit.""
Other titles without Sales Ranks included an anthology of gay American writing, ""The First Time I Met Frank O'Hara,"" two serious-minded non-fiction works, ""Homosexuality in Cold War America"" and ""The Gay Metropolis,"" as well the straightforwardly titled ""Ellen DeGeneres: A Biography.""
""Many books have now been fixed and we’re in the process of fixing the remainder as quickly as possible,"" Smith wrote. ""We intend to implement new measures to make this kind of accident less likely to occur in the future.""

No animal is.Of course this bear snapped—bears used by circuses are kept in a constant state of distress.

And that’s after they’ve been taken away from their mothers as cubs, tethered by the neck, and forcibly trained into performing confusing tricks.Why is the bear in the video walking on his hind legs?Walking on their hind legs is unnatural for bears. But during training, bears are often forced to stand on their hind legs for hours—if they can’t do it, they risk choking and hanging themselves.

SAN FRANCISCO — Apple, which had long deferred paying taxes on its foreign earnings and had become synonymous with hoarding money overseas, unveiled plans on Wednesday that would bring back the vast majority of the $252 billion in cash that it held abroad and said it would make a sizable investment in the United States.
With the moves, Apple took advantage of the new tax code that President Trump signed into law last month. A provision allows for a one-time repatriation of corporate cash held abroad at a lower tax rate than what would have been paid under the previous tax plan. Apple, which has 94 percent of its total cash of $269 billion outside the United States, said it would make a one-time tax payment of $38 billion on the repatriated cash.
For years, Apple had said it would not bring its foreign earnings back to the United States until the corporate tax code changed, because such a move would be too costly. Now Apple’s bet to hold back on paying such taxes is reaping rewards under the Trump administration.
In return, Mr. Trump and other Republicans can point to Apple as having come around because of their legislative action. The $38 billion tax payment from the Silicon Valley giant is set to be among the biggest payouts from the tax bill, and Apple said it would put some of the money it brought back toward 20,000 new jobs, a new domestic campus and other spending.
“I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday. “Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS.”
Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said in a statement, “We have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible.”
Apple estimated that its direct impact on the American economy would total more than $350 billion over the next five years, but how much that goes beyond what the company would have spent anyway is unclear. Apple’s current pace of spending in the United States is $55 billion for 2018, so it was already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years. After the $38 billion tax payment is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years.
A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said Apple had consistently spent tens of billions of dollars on areas like staffing and capital expenditures in recent years. Bringing back the overseas cash, he said, does little to aid its expansion. But it makes the company appear to answer Mr. Trump’s call for more jobs to be created in the United States.
“This is Apple putting its best foot forward consistent with objectives of the administration,” Mr. Sacconaghi said.
Apple is one of several multinational giants that have kept a total of roughly $3 trillion in global profits off their domestic books to sidestep the previous 35 percent federal corporate tax rate. Under the new tax law, companies that make a one-time repatriation of cash will be taxed at a rate of 15.5 percent on cash holdings and 8 percent on nonliquid assets. That is lower than the new 21 percent corporate rate. And under the new tax code, Apple would also have been taxed whether it brought the money back or not.
By shifting the money under the new terms, Apple has saved $43 billion in taxes, more than any other American company, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group in Washington.
Other tech giants are set to follow suit in the coming months. Companies like Microsoft, Alphabet and Cisco also shifted their profits into offshore shell companies, avoiding billions of dollars in taxes, and are now in a better position to bring the money back.
Although Republican supporters of the tax law argued that the influx of international profits would create jobs and increase wages, many economists disagreed that a one-time repatriation would have any substantial impact on real investment.
Apple’s announcement, couched as a major investment in the United States instead of a massive financial windfall, followed years of criticism that the company did not do enough for the American economy because it makes most of its products in China and parked its profits abroad.
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Apple was a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who pledged that as president he would force the company to start making iPhones and Macs in the United States. While that hasn’t happened and is unlikely to, Apple has since gone on a charm offensive to demonstrate its value to the American economy.
The company has highlighted the number of jobs created by the so-called app economy, an ecosystem of software and services that run on the iPhone and other Apple products. Last year, Apple also said it was creating a $1 billion fund to invest in advanced manufacturing in the United States. On Wednesday, Apple said it was increasing the size of that fund to $5 billion and noted that it was already backing projects from manufacturers in Kentucky and Texas.
Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., also took a page out of Amazon’s public relations strategy on Wednesday by saying it will open a new domestic campus in a location where it currently has no operations. Amazon garnered good will throughout the country last year when it announced plans to open a second corporate headquarters outside its home base of Seattle.
Apple currently has about 84,000 employees in the United States, so 20,000 new jobs would be a 24 percent increase. The company added that it would invest more than $30 billion in capital expenditures, or spending on parts and the equipment required to produce them, over the next five years in the United States.
For a comparison, Apple spent $14.9 billion in capital expenditures in the last fiscal year, though it did not specify how much it spends in the United States alone.
For Apple, repatriating the cash creates opportunities that could include acquisitions and higher dividends for shareholders. The company had previously chosen to borrow money to fund its stock buybacks and dividends, instead of bringing its cash back from abroad. Over the last five years, Apple has returned $233 billion in cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.
Paying $38 billion in taxes now is unlikely to strain Apple’s checkbook because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings.
“From a financial statement perspective, it’s going to be a nonevent,” said J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova University law professor and former Internal Revenue Service official. Other companies are not as prepared, he said, and would likely have to take a significant loss should they make a one-time cash repatriation.
Apple employees will see benefits as well. Mr. Cook said in an email to staff on Wednesday that Apple was increasing investment in its employees by rewarding them with bonuses of $2,500 in restricted stock units, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans were not public. Apple joins other companies, such as AT&T, that have issued employee bonuses since the tax law was signed.

Could this be the next iPhone screw?

A Wednesday posting on Reddit shows an asymmetrical screw, allegedly designed by Apple, that would be impossible to remove with tools currently available on the market. While the authenticity of the screw is in question, and while such a screw would certainly slow down the device dissection efforts of average users, no one should fear that any specially designed screw would keep out serious DIYers for long.
Wired reached out to iFixit co-founder Kyle Wiens to ask his opinion on the legitimacy of the design. According to Wiens, the design is a bit too far-fetched: ""My gut feel is that this isn't from Apple. The threads are unrealistic, and I suspect that a head like that is too complex to use as a tool head. Existing tool designs tend to be simple because the head needs to withstand a fair amount of torque.""
There's also the issue of price. ""If this is an Apple design, it looks like it would be expensive to manufacture. Apple uses tiny screws, and that's a very complex screw head,"" Wiens said, adding in an email, ""Tiny + Mechanically Complex = Money.""
But just because the design is probably fake, it doesn't mean it's implausible that Apple would introduce a new proprietary screw design for upcoming devices. The company has done it before, and it didn't stop the DIY crowd.
When the iPhone 4 was introduced in June 2010, Wiens noticed that iPhones shipped to Japan had peculiar screws on the bottom of the device. Apple had introduced Pentalobe screws for iPhone 4 devices in Japan and would eventually add the screws to all new iPhone 4 devices sold in the U.S., as well as any older iPhones that were taken in for service. Within months, iFixit began selling a Pentalobe screwdriver and the home repairs continued apace.
In other words: The market quickly adapted.
So, while the purported screw design might speak to companies like Apple creating barriers to keep average users out of gadgets, quick fabrication capabilities are on the rise, and it's easier than ever to create custom tools to crack open locked-down hardware. Wiens told Wired, ""For creating the tool and getting it to market [in the U.S.], it'll take a couple weeks. Getting [the custom tool] available in Shenzhen, just days.""
China's ability to quickly fabricate and build custom tools and parts means any custom tool can be available for online ordering in a matter of weeks. However, just because a tool is available online doesn't mean U.S. retailers can legally sell it. Tech companies are vigilant about protecting all their R&D, so Wiens is concerned that custom screws could be patented – and these patents could prevent the legal sale of custom tools.
Patent or no patent, that won't stop retailers in China producing specially designed tools and selling them to the U.S. market. ""It's kind of like Jurassic Park – nature always finds a way."" Wiens told Wired.
And like the velociraptors of the tech world, the DIY crowd will always figure out how to tear open a device."ÿÿWhy Apple's Custom iPhone Screws Can't Stop the DIY Community

The MacBook Pro with Retina display has barely been out two days, but we can now see what's inside it courtesy of iFixit. Post-teardown, it still looks like a great piece of hardware, but it's also apparent how similar it's becoming to the MacBook Air. As with the Air, the new Pro's RAM is soldered to its logic board, meaning that you'll be stuck with whatever amount you get at point of purchase. It's also using proprietary screws and Flash memory, a first for the MacBook Pro line, and the battery is affixed with glue rather than screws. That makes it much more difficult to replace, especially because it's apparently right above the fragile trackpad cable. The new one-piece screen, meanwhile, means you'll end up replacing the entire assembly if anything goes wrong.
Outside this, the teardown confirmed some things we'd heard about when the new Pro was announced. The fan indeed has asymmetric blade spacing, meant to reduce its noise, and the components are made by Samsung, as one might expect. It's got a 95Wh battery at 10.95V (compared to 77.5Wh previously) and a pair of Broadcom chips with 802.11n dual-band wireless support and Bluetooth 4.0. And that one-piece Retina screen is apparently quite the visual treat. You can find the entire teardown, with pictures, over here."ÿÿMacBook Pro with Retina display dismantled by iFixit, revealing soldered RAM

Because of glue, and impossibility of upgrading RAM and storage, DIY repair company gives new notebook worst-possible fix-it score
By
Senior Reporter, Computerworld |
iFixit, a popular electronics do-it-yourself website, today gave the new MacBook Pro with the Retina display its worst-possible repair score of just 1 out of a possible 10.
""This is, to date, the least-repairable laptop we've taken apart,"" said Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, in an email today. ""Apple has packed all the things we hate into one beautiful little package.""
Apple on Monday introduced the new MacBook Pro, whose distinguishing feature is the high-resolution display that the company labeled ""Retina"" -- its marketing name for the pixel-packed screens also found in its iPhone and iPad lines.
The MacBook Pro was the first Apple laptop to feature the Retina display.
Although the notebook is in extremely short supply, iFixit managed to grab one, then disassembled the system to determine whether it could be repaired or upgraded by owners.
""Laptops are expensive. It's critical that consumers have the option to repair things that go wrong, as well as upgrade their own hardware to keep it relevant as new technologies roll out,"" said Wiens.
But that's not feasible here.
""The new MacBook Pro is virtually non-upgradeable -- making it the first MacBook Pro that will be unable to adapt to future advances in memory and storage technology,"" said Wiens.
The teardown revealed that Apple used many of the same assembly techniques as it does with the self-contained and virtually un-upgradeable MacBook Air, including proprietary screws, copious amounts of glue, expensive parts -- the screen in particular -- that must be completely replaced even after the smallest failure, and fused components that will likely break when a neighboring part must be removed.
As Wiens noted, the new MacBook Pro really can't be upgraded after purchase.
As in the MacBook Air, the laptop's memory is soldered to the logic board, eliminating any later RAM upgrade. Customers must order the Pro with the exact amount of memory they desire, and pay Apple's high prices.
Although the MacBook Pro with Retina display comes equipped with 8GB of RAM standard, boosting that to 16GB at the time of purchase adds another $200 to the already=steep $2,199 sticker price of the base model.
At Crucial.com, a popular source for notebook memory upgrades, 8GB of additional RAM for a 15-in. MacBook Pro that doesn't feature the Retina display costs just $87.
Nor can the solid-state drive (SSD) be swapped out for something larger, at least not currently.
""The proprietary SSD isn't upgradeable either, yet, as it is similar but not identical to the one in the [MacBook] Air,"" said Wiens.
With the case out of the way, the new Retina MacBook Pro's innards are exposed. But what's still hidden are the traits that make this notebook virtually un-upgradeable. (Image: iFixIt.)
That means that current third-party replacements for the SSD in the MacBook Air won't work in the Pro. User will have to wait until suppliers offer Pro-compatible SSD alternatives.
The just-refreshed 13-in. MacBook Air scored a ""3"" out of a possible 10. iFixit attributed the higher score of the Air to its use of screws, rather than glue, to fix the battery in place.
By comparison, last year's MacBook Pro -- iFixit hasn't taken apart the non-Retina model Apple announced Monday -- rated a ""7"" on the repair meter.
iFixit's teardown and associated commentary is available on its website.

This week Microsoft has been facing the judges at the EU
Columnist Bill Thompson asks whether the time has come for Apple to be put under the EU microscope in the same way as Microsoft has.
Microsoft was humiliated by the European Union's Court of First Instance on Monday when it rejected almost all elements of the software giant's appeal against the 2004 rulings made by the competition commissioner.
The court found that Microsoft had abused its monopoly power in pushing an embedded Windows Media Player out with Windows XP and Vista, and that the lack of detailed technical information about the programming interfaces and data formats for Windows Server products was an illegal barrier to competition.
Both rulings will have significant implications for other cases before the commission, including those against chipmakers Intel, Rambus and Qualcomm, who can all expect to be questioned further under EU rules concerning the abuse of market dominance.
Microsoft has been a target for a long time. The court case resolved this week concerned a judgment made four years ago about a complaint filed in 1998.
Yet while its every move is examined for evidence that it might be making life difficult for its rivals, some of its competitors seem to get a very easy ride.
Market dominance?
iPod owners are locked into an Apple world The best example of this is Apple, which managed to get acres of coverage for the UK launch of the iPhone, despite the many ways in which the device is closed, locked down and restricted.
Of course the iPhone is a new product with a tiny market share, so there are no issues of dominance, but when it comes to music players and music downloads the situation is very different, and yet it is rarely commented on.
Apple has spent much time trying to ensure that anyone who buys an iPod is completely locked in to an Apple-centred world in which they use iTunes, buy from the iTunes Music Store, and purchase only Apple-certified iPod accessories.
The recent launch of the new range of iPods, including the video Nano and the iPod Touch, has shown just how far Apple is willing to go to make life difficult for its users in order to shore up its dominant position in the market for music players and downloads.
If Apple was serious about building a music industry around downloads and digital devices then it would open up its devices and interfaces to allow greater innovation and greater competition First, if you had gone to the trouble of making your own ringtones for your iPhone using snatches of song from your library then you will find they are all gone the next time you sync with the latest iTunes. Apple now sells ringtones to its US customers for $0.99 and it would rather you paid up than made them yourself.
Second, it seems that the new generation of iPods will not output video through cables or docks that aren't Apple authorised and have a specific ""authentication"" chip. Apple charges a hefty cut for joining its approved suppliers programme, and this is a way to ensure that vendors sign up.
But the nastiest little change is to the iTunes library itself. iTunes keeps your songs organised using a database, and over the years a number of free and open source music players have been developed that can read and write this database format.
This is important as Apple doesn't support Linux, so any Linux user who can't resist the lure of an iPod needs a non-Apple library manager, but it also gives Mac and Windows users a bit of flexibility.
Programmes like gtkpod, Rhythmbox and Banshee are easy to use and don't try to sell you songs all the time, but now Apple has added a new feature to the iTunes database, a special number which is calculated from your list of files using a process only Apple knows.
If the number is wrong, your library looks empty. And because the free players don't know the algorithm used, they can no longer be used with iTunes/iPod.
There seems to be no reason for this change except to break the functionality of alternative jukebox software. It will not limit copying or restrict attempts to strip digital rights management code from tracks.
It will not stop people adding non-DRM files they have downloaded from the internet to their library. All it will do is stop the third party players working and force anyone with an iPod to use iTunes.
Apple has form in this area. In 2004 it threatened Real Networks with court action over Harmony, a product that could add Apple's FairPlay DRM to tracks downloaded from the Real music store, and then changed the way FairPlay worked in order to create its own favoured form of disharmony.
And you can't easily persuade iTunes to share music or stream music over Airport Express if you're using non-Apple clients because the Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP) used by iTunes has cryptographic keys built in to stop third-party software working.
Cat and mouse
It is hard to see what justification there can be for these various measures other than an attempt to lock customers in and keep competitors out.
I've asked Apple why it is doing this, but it has remained characteristically silent, preferring to invest its time and energy in the iPhone's UK launch.
Apple is dominant in both music player and downloads market In fact the new iTunes database format has already been cracked, as reported on Ian Monroe's blog, and the third party tools will soon be updated. But Apple will certainly release a new version of iTunes that breaks the fix, in the ongoing game of cat and mouse that characterises this technology.
I want to admire Apple. I want to like them. In the last year I've bought - with my own money - three of its computers and two iPods, and enjoy them greatly.
But its business practices do not stand up to scrutiny, and when it comes to music downloads it is just as bad as Microsoft on servers, putting its time and energy into creating barriers to competition instead of letting its developers and designers concentrate on doing great stuff.
If Apple was serious about building a music industry around downloads and digital devices then it would open up its devices and interfaces to allow greater innovation and greater competition.
It would have faith in its own products to compete in this larger ecosystem instead of trying to lock everyone in with tactics that resemble those of IBM in the days of the mainframe.
I wrote a presentation this morning using Microsoft's PowerPoint, but displayed it using Apple's Keynote. Apple can sell Keynote because it took PowerPoint apart and figured out how the files work.
Had Apple been unable to do so, or found that every time it figured out what was happening Microsoft changed the format, it would have complained loudly.
Yet this is exactly the technique it is using against third party jukeboxes. And it is time it stopped.

The European Commission's complaint against Apple Inc. and the major record labels over a possible violation of European rules on cross-border trade has served to highlight the inconsistencies in how music is released and priced online.
Several years after e-commerce became mainstream and made international shopping for physical goods as easy as a few mouse clicks, the markets for online content, be it music, movies or other intellectual property, are still constrained by national borders.
""Consumers can only buy music from the iTunes online stores in their country of residence and are therefore restricted in their choice of where to buy music, and consequently what music is available and at what price,"" European Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said at a Brussels news conference on Tuesday when the action was announced. He was referring to a restriction that lets customers use only the store of the country in which their credit card is issued -- typically the country where they live.
And that can be a hassle, especially if you're one of the 5 million EU citizens who now works in a member state other than their own or even if you just happen to be a Portuguese fan of hardcore German heavy metal music.
Take ""A la faveur de l'automne"" by Tete."" It's currently ranked number two in iTunes France and is also on sale in the Belgium and Luxembourg stores but consumers across the Channel in the U.K. won't find it in their local store. Or try searching for ""Yassou Maria"" by Sarbel, the number-four ranked song on iTunes Greece, in the iTunes Music Store in Finland or Portugal. It's not there.
It's not just local acts that are affected by the restrictions. ""Girlfriend,"" the new single from Avril Lavigne is available in multiple versions on several national iTunes stores but can't be found in iTunes Spain, Greece and Portugal. Sony BMG says that in this case it's the result of an error but even so local fans can't buy it from an alternative iTunes store and have to wait for the error to be rectified.
And whether the music is available locally or not, the restrictions also stop consumers from shopping around for the best price. Songs are priced at &#8364.0.99 (US$1.32) in euro-zone stores but cost &#163.0.79 (US$1.56) in the U.K. and 8Kr (US$1.43) in Denmark. Both countries are in the European Union but outside of the euro zone.
That inability to buy from stores is in other member states lies at the heart of the Commission's complaint. Article 81 of the EC Treaty prohibits actions that could prevent or restrict trade between European Union member states and so the Commission contends that restrictions preventing cross-border shopping are against this law.
""Apple has always wanted to operate a single, pan-European iTunes store accessible by anyone from any member state, but we were advised by the music labels and publishers that there were certain legal limits to the rights they could grant us,"" the company said in an e-mailed statement. ""We don't believe Apple did anything to violate EU law. We will continue to work with the EU to resolve this matter.""
It appears the Commission's main target is not Apple but the music companies and music rights agencies, which work on a national basis and give Apple very little choice but to offer national stores.
""Our view is that the agreements were imposed on Apple by the record companies,"" said the Commission's Todd at Tuesday's news conference. He said Apple had also been charged because ""it entered into restrictive agreements too.""
The companies got the Commission's complaint in a ""Statement of Objections"" document, which is a formal step in European antitrust investigations. The recipients now have two months to defend themselves in writing or can request an oral hearing with the Commission. After hearing the company's defense, the Commission makes its final decision, which could include a maximum fine of 10 percent of a company's global annual turnover, should it be determined that the firm has violated antitrust laws.

My, how the tables have turned. Earlier this week, we learned that Apple had suddenly begun to pull third party iPhone applications for Google Voice, citing the unconvincing rationale that they “duplicated” some of the iPhone’s functionality. We then broke the news that Apple had also rejected Google’s own official Google Voice application submitted six weeks prior, sparking a din of complaints from developers and users alike over the arbitrary and possibly anti-competitive restrictions being imposed by Apple . AT&T, too, has been a target of frequent criticism as many of us believe it may have also played a part in the decision. Of course, nobody really knows who is to blame — AT&T has hinted that it was ultimately Apple’s decision, and Apple continues to remain mute on the issue. But now we may get our answers: the Dow Jones newswire reports that The Federal Communications Commission is looking into Apple’s rejection of Google Voice, and has sent letters to AT&T, Apple, and Google to find out what’s going on. We’ve obtained copies of the letters and reprinted them below.
The newswire report notes that this is part of the FCC’s ongoing investigation into wireless handsets and their exclusive deals with carriers. Of course, this all comes years after Google CEO Eric Schmidt sent a letter to the FCC, urging it to adopt open standards that would gives users the freedom to use whichever applications they’d like on their wireless devices, on whichever network they preferred. At the time the suggestions seemed perhaps a bit idealistic, but now it’s becoming clear just how badly they’re needed.
It has been just over one year since Apple released the App Store, and already we’re beginning to see just what can happen when major companies collude to restrict user choice without fear of recourse. As I’ve written before, Google Voice offers a service that innovates in the telephony space in a way that hasn’t been seen for years. But rather than try to improve and offer a better service, Apple and AT&T are doing what they can do to protect their sacred cash cow. But it looks like the government isn’t going to stand for that any longer. With this move, the FCC is showing that it’s not going to let Apple carry its famed culture of secrecy into the telecom space.

Catherine A. Novelli, Vice President Worldwide Government Affairs Apple Inc. 901 15th Street, NW, Suite 1000 Washington, DC 20005
RE: Google Voice and related iPhone applications
Dear Ms. Novelli:
Recent press reports indicate that Apple has declined to approve the Google Voice application for the iPhone and has removed related (and previously approved) third-party applications from the iPhone App Store. In light of pending FCC proceedings regarding wireless open access (RM-11361) and handset exclusivity (RM-11497), we are interested in a more complete understanding of this situation.
To that end, please provide answers to the following questions by close of business on Friday, August 21, 2009.
1. Why did Apple reject the Google Voice application for iPhone and remove related third-party applications from its App Store? In addition to Google Voice, which related third-party applications were removed or have been rejected? Please provide the specific name of each application and the contact information for the developer. 2. Did Apple act alone, or in consultation with AT&T, in deciding to reject the Google Voice application and related applications? If the latter, please describe the communications between Apple and AT&T in connection with the decision to reject Google Voice. Are there any contractual conditions or non-contractual understandings with AT&T that affected Apple’s decision in this matter? 3. Does AT&T have any role in the approval of iPhone applications generally (or in certain cases)? If so, under what circumstances, and what role does it play? What roles are specified in the contractual provisions between Apple and AT&T (or any non-contractual understandings) regarding the consideration of particular iPhone applications? 4. Please explain any differences between the Google Voice iPhone application and any Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications that Apple has approved for the iPhone. Are any of the approved VoIP applications allowed to operate on AT&T’s 3G network? 5. What other applications have been rejected for use on the iPhone and for what reasons? Is there a list of prohibited applications or of categories of applications that is provided to potential vendors/developers? If so, is this posted on the iTunes website or otherwise disclosed to consumers? 6. What are the standards for considering and approving iPhone applications? What is the approval process for such applications (timing, reasons for rejection, appeal process, etc.)? What is the percentage of applications that are rejected? What are the major reasons for rejecting an application?
Request for Confidential Treatment. If Apple requests that any information or documents responsive to this letter be treated in a confidential manner, it shall submit, along with all responsive information and documents, a statement in accordance with section 0.459 of the Commission’s rules. 47 C.F.R. § 0.459. Requests for confidential treatment must comply with the requirements of section 0.459, including the standards of specificity mandated by section 0.459(b). Accordingly, “blanket” requests for confidentiality of a large set of documents are unacceptable. Pursuant to section 0.459(c), the Bureau will not consider requests that do not comply with the requirements of section 0.459.
Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation.

Dear Mr. Cicconi:
1. What role, if any, did AT&T play in Apple’s consideration of the Google Voice and related applications? What role, if any, does AT&T play in consideration of iPhone applications generally? What roles are specified in the contractual provisions between Apple and AT&T (or in any non-contractual understanding between the companies) regarding the consideration of particular iPhone applications? 2. Did Apple consult with AT&T in the process of deciding to reject the Google Voice application? If so, please describe any communications between AT&T and Apple or Google on this topic, including the parties involved and a summary of any meetings or discussions. 3. Please explain AT&T’s understanding of any differences between the Google Voice iPhone application and any Voice over Internet Protocol applications that are currently used on the AT&T network, either via the iPhone or via handsets other than the iPhone. 4. To AT&T’s knowledge, what other applications have been rejected for use on the iPhone? Which of these applications were designed to operate on AT&T’s 3G network? What was AT&T’s role in considering whether such applications would be approved or rejected? 5. Please detail any conditions included in AT&T’s agreements or contracts with Apple for the iPhone related to the certification of applications or any particular application’s ability to use AT&T’s 3G network. 6. Are there any terms in AT&T’s customer agreements that limit customer usage of certain third-party applications? If so, please indicate how consumers are informed of such limitations and whether such limitations are posted on the iTunes website as well. In general, what is AT&T’s role in certifying applications on devices that run over AT&T’s 3G network? What, if any, applications require AT&T’s approval to be added to a device?

[Adobe would like me to make it clear that the opinions below are not the official views of the company and are entirely my own.]
By now you have surely heard about the new iPhone 4.0 SDK language that appears to make creating applications in any non-Apple-approved languages a violation of terms. Obviously Adobe is looking into this wording carefully so I will not comment any further until there is an official conclusion.
[Sentence regarding Apple’s intentions redacted at request from Adobe]. This has nothing to do whatsoever with bringing the Flash player to Apple’s devices. That is a separate discussion entirely. What they are saying is that they won’t allow applications onto their marketplace solely because of what language was originally used to create them. This is a frightening move that has no rational defense other than wanting tyrannical control over developers and more importantly, wanting to use developers as pawns in their crusade against Adobe. This does not just affect Adobe but also other technologies like Unity3D.
I am positive that there are a large number of Apple employees that strongly disagree with this latest move. Any real developer would not in good conscience be able to support this. The trouble is that we will never hear their discontent because Apple employees are forbidden from blogging, posting to social networks, or other things that we at companies with an open culture take for granted.
Adobe and Apple has had a long relationship and each has helped the other get where they are today. The fact that Apple would make such a hostile and despicable move like this clearly shows the difference between our two companies. All we want is to provide creative professionals an avenue to deploy their work to as many devices as possible. We are not looking to kill anything or anyone. This would be like us putting something in our SDK to make it impossible for 3rd-party editors like FDT to work with our platform. I can tell you that we wouldn’t even think or consider something like that.
Many of Adobe’s supporters have mentioned that we should discontinue the Creative Suite products on OS X as a form of retaliation. Again, this is something that Adobe would never consider in a million years. We are not looking to abuse our loyal users and make them pawns for the sake of trying to hurt another company. What is clear is that Apple most definitely would do that sort of thing as is evidenced by their recent behavior.
Personally I will not be giving Apple another cent of my money until there is a leadership change over there. I’ve already moved most of my book, music, and video purchases to Amazon and I will continue to look elsewhere. Now, I want to be clear that I am not suggesting you do the same and I’m also not trying to organize some kind of boycott. Me deciding not to give money to Apple is not going to do anything to their bottom line. But this is equivalent to me walking into Macy’s to buy a new wallet and the salesperson spits in my face. Chances are I won’t be buying my wallets at Macy’s anymore, no matter how much I like them.
Now let me put aside my role as an official representative of Adobe for a moment as Speaking purely for myself, I would look to make it clear what is going through my mind at the moment. Go screw yourself Apple.

Very few people get the chance to make history. Even fewer get the chance to make it twice. Perhaps that is why it is so fascinating to watch Steve Jobs as he tries to usher in the era of mobile touch computing today, just as he ushered in the era of the personal computer three decades ago. But I wonder whether he is repeating the very same mistakes which relegated Macs to a niche market. Or did he learn from those mistakes so that Apple comes out on top this time?
Jobs is once again pitting Apple’s complete product design mastery against the rest of the industry, except this time he thinks he will prevail. Whether it is his repeated moves to keep Adobe’s Flash off the iPhone or his growing rift with Google over Android, Jobs is making the iPhone and iPad a relatively closed system that Apple can control. All apps need to be approved by Apple, the ads shown on the apps will also start to go through Apple, and no matter how hard Adobe tries to open up the iPhone to its Flash developers Apple will keep blocking all its efforts.
Developers and pundits can cry foul all they want about Apple’s lack of openness. But remember, companies are only open when it is convenient for them. The fight with Adobe has always been about making developers play by Apple’s rules. And right now they can make those rules because they have all the customers.
In the desktop era, Windows had the most apps, which translated directly into sales. Today on mobile, the iPhone has the most apps and Jobs wants to keep it that way. Allowing Adobe or Microsoft to port apps developed for other devices to the iPhone devalues the iPhone, which is why Apple is cracking down so hard on Adobe. It is not about Flash, it is about developers. As John Gruber writes:
The App Store platform could turn into a long-term de facto standard platform. That’s how Microsoft became Microsoft. At a certain point developers wrote apps for Windows because so many users were on Windows and users bought Windows PCs because all the software was being written for Windows. That’s the sort of situation that creates a license to print money.
But how long will that license last? The iPhone faces a growing threat from Google’s Android phones, which are the PCs of the mobile world. Only Apple makes the iPhone, but many phone manufacturers make Android phones just like many PC makers produce Windows PCs. Slowly but surely, those Android phones are getting better. And already Android sales are collectively catching up to iPhone sales.
Of all people, surely he sees what is coming. Is he ignoring his own history, or does he know it so well that this time he is going to try to rewrite it by changing the outcome? As long as the iPhone remains the leading smartphone, he can try to lock out Google’s ads and lock in developers with their apps (and, by extension, customers who want those apps).
Still, it seems like history could repeat itself, with the rest of the industry closing the innovation gap with Apple fast. With Google subsidizing the mobile OS, other phone manufacturers have an economic advantage as well. Jobs is trying everything he can to hold back the Android advance, including suing HTC, the largest manufacturer of Android phones. He is fighting Google with everything he’s got—undercutting Google’s pending acquisition of AdMob by entering the mobile advertising market and creating fear among Android partners with his patent lawsuit.
In the end, it is the victors who write history. Right now, Jobs is winning. Can he keep winning or is history against him?"ÿÿIs Steve Jobs Ignoring History, Or Trying To Rewrite It? – TechCrunch

May 3, 2010 | 4:00am
After years of being the little guy who used Washington to fend off Goliaths like Microsoft, Apple CEO Steve Jobs is about to learn what life is like when the shoe’s on the other foot.
According to a person familiar with the matter, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are locked in negotiations over which of the watchdogs will begin an antitrust inquiry into Apple’s new policy of requiring software developers who devise applications for devices such as the iPhone and iPad to use only Apple’s programming tools.
Regulators, this person said, are days away from making a decision about which agency will launch the inquiry. It will focus on whether the policy, which took effect last month, kills competition by forcing programmers to choose between developing apps that can run only on Apple gizmos or come up with apps that are platform neutral, and can be used on a variety of operating systems, such as those from rivals Google, Microsoft and Research In Motion.
An inquiry doesn’t necessarily mean action will be taken against Apple, which argues the rule is in place to ensure the quality of the apps it sells to customers. Typically, regulators initiate inquiries to determine whether a full-fledged investigation ought to be launched. If the inquiry escalates to an investigation, the agency handling the matter would issue Apple a subpoena seeking information about the policy.
Officials at both the Justice Department and FTC declined comment. Apple did not return calls seeking comment.
The threat of Apple being the subject of an investigation would be a remarkable turnabout for a company that has long seen itself as being outside the establishment, and one that has egged on antitrust officials to blunt the momentum of larger rivals.
However, thanks to the popularity of the iPod and iPhone, Apple is having a tough time continuing to play the role of David fighting against Goliath. Indeed, its market cap of $237.6 billion exceeds that of the world’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart, whose market cap is $201.7 billion.
Apple put its might on full display last week when Jobs wrote a scathing explanation for why Adobe’s Flash programming language was unfit to be used on Apple products. The day his missive was released, Adobe shares fell 2 percent.
In forcing computer programmers to choose developing an Apple-exclusive app over one that can be used on Apple and rival devices simultaneously, critics say Apple is hampering competition since the expense involved in creating an app will lead developers with limited budgets to focus on one format, not two. Generally, app developers are paid from a cut of the revenue generated when consumers buy the app.
Shaun Meredith, a former Apple employee who runs software development company InfoBridge, said that as a result of Apple’s rule change, some of his customers are choosing to finance apps that are compatible with all of Apple’s competitors instead of those that work only with the iPhone or iPad.
Indeed, though Apple has the most applications, it is a distant second in terms of operating system market share. According to comScore, RIM, which makes the BlackBerry, has a 42 percent share, while Apple’s take is 25 percent. Microsoft has 15 percent and Google’s Android software has 9 percent. j

The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are looking closely into Apple’s business practices in relation to its upcoming music streaming service, according to multiple sources. The Verge has learned that Apple has been pushing major music labels to force streaming services like Spotify to abandon their free tiers, which will dramatically reduce the competition for Apple’s upcoming offering. DOJ officials have already interviewed high-ranking music industry executives about Apple’s business habits, but it appears the FTC has taken the lead in recent weeks.
""All the way up to Tim Cook, these guys are cutthroat.""
Apple has been using its considerable power in the music industry to stop the music labels from renewing Spotify’s license to stream music through its free tier. Spotify currently has 60 million listeners, but only 15 million of them are paid users. Getting the music labels to kill the freemium tiers from Spotify and others could put Apple in prime position to grab a large swath of new users when it launches its own streaming service, which is widely expected to feature a considerable amount of exclusive content. ""All the way up to Tim Cook, these guys are cutthroat,"" one music industry source said.
Sources also indicated that Apple offered to pay YouTube’s music licensing fee to Universal Music Group if the label stopped allowing its songs on YouTube. Apple is seemingly trying to clear a path before its streaming service launches, which is expected to debut at WWDC in June. If Apple convinces the labels to stop licensing freemium services from Spotify and YouTube, it could take out a significant portion of business from its two largest music competitors.
Apple has an antitrust monitor on its campus, courtesy of the DOJ after Apple was found guilty in an ebook antitrust case last year (Apple is appealing the decision), but it's not clear if that monitor is involved in this latest situation. The DOJ and the FTC aren't the only entity looking into Apple’s dealings with the music industry, either. According to the New York Post, Apple is being probed by the European Union’s Competition Commission to find out if the company is working with the labels to rid the industry of freemium services.
Apple declined to comment.

Update: Apple released a message to its users on Thursday, addressing concerns about iPhones after the company confirmed it slowed certain models to protect aging batteries. Apple apologized for the “misunderstanding about the issue” and assured customers that it had “never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product.” It also promised to replace iPhone 6 or later batteries for $29 — a $50 discount. Read Apple’s full statement here. The original story is below.
The delay in typing messages, or the lag in loading my mail on my iPhone, has been explained. Apple has confirmed that it does deliberately slow down the operation of older iPhones, and says it is doing so to prevent the devices from shutting down because of aging batteries.
Apple says it’s doing this to protect your phone. As the lithium-ion batteries in the phones age, they can’t handle processing demands at the same capacity, which causes the phone to shut down unexpectedly. The company released an update to stop those unexpected shutdowns, which also means the phones work a little more slowly.
But the revelation — or confession — that Apple is purposely decreasing phone speed fed into a conspiracy theory that’s been circulating for a while on “planned obsolescence.” After new products are released, the theory goes, Apple intentionally messes with your iPhone, frustrating you and forcing you to shell out money to upgrade.
The data on Apple slowing down older iPhones doesn’t necessarily mean the conspiracy theory is true. A relatively recent change to its operating system prompted the slowdowns. But the system update demonstrates why the conspiracy theory keeps circulating: It took an independent investigation by an expert and a viral Reddit post to get Apple to admit what had happened.
This whole saga began with a Reddit post — and ended with an Apple confession
People who owned iPhone 6, 6s, and 6s Plus devices complained earlier this year that they were spontaneously shutting down, even though they had sufficient battery. This was usually happening during “peak current demands,” when you’d be doing something on your phone that required a burst of power — like in the middle of a game, or downloading an app.
Those users had to plug in and recharge their phones in order to get them back online. Apple acknowledged the bug and introduced a fix in an update to its operating system software, iOS 10.2.1, which the company said would largely remedy the issue. Phones no longer shut down, but according to users, they did slow down.
Then last week, a Reddit post blew up that suggested the iPhone battery might be to blame for these slowness problems.
John Poole, founder of Primate Labs and Geekbench developer, seized on this hypothesis, and pulled together and compared data from the performance testing Geekbench had done on users’ iPhone 6s and 7 devices.
He analyzed all that data from a sample set of approximately 100,000 phones, and said he had tens of thousands of results across different versions of iOS — specifically, he looked at iOS 10.2.0, the version before Apple fixed the shutdown bug, and iOS 10.2.1, which was released after the fix. (He also looked at later versions, including 11.2.0, which is a more recent software update.)
His analysis revealed that processors did slow down after the update meant to fix the shutdown problem, that the problem was widespread, and that, as he put it, it was “likely to get worse as phones (and their batteries) continue to age.”
Poole, and others, speculated that the link between old batteries and slower performance had to do with the initial iPhone 6 glitch, and Apple, in fixing that, slowed down the system to avoid overloading the batteries. (He also noted that iPhone 6s users who replaced their batteries had faster phones.)
And though the iPhone 7 never had those spontaneous shutdown issues, Poole’s results indicated that it did slow down in later updates — a sign that Apple was doing this across its models.
“Once the phone is shut down, the battery is in a state where the only way to get the phone back online is to plug it into a charger. If you’re out with your phone on the go, that’s clearly not a great situation to be in,” Poole said.
“So Apple, with this fix, basically limited the processor from overtaxing the battery. But the flip side of that is now the processor can’t run as quickly as it might in a new phone with a new battery.”
Poole’s data got a lot of buzz, and finally Apple responded:
Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices. Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.
Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. We’ve now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future.
So Apple basically confirmed Poole’s results and redditors’ theories. “With this large of a sample size, I’m confident the numbers we have produced are accurate, and also the fact that Apple has verified,” Poole said. “It gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling that we didn’t screw up our analysis.”
Case closed?
To many, Apple’s admission seemed like proof of the company’s grand conspiracy to force people to keep buying new phones. But Apple’s explanation, and Poole’s, suggests the opposite — a slower phone is better than a glitchy one that suddenly shuts down. It’s more likely that people would end up replacing a phone that constantly shut down than a phone that’s a little slow.
Poole said the battery explanation is legitimate. Lithium-ion batteries age over time. That wear and tear makes them less capable of meeting the power and processing demands in the same way as a youthful iPhone. This is also intensified with the iPhone, which has a particularly speedy processor — which puts even more stress on the batteries.
“I have a feeling this is a weird confluence of Apple’s desire to have very thin, very sleek phones coupled with also having the fastest processors in the industry,” Poole explained.
“The fact that Apple is using these very fast, very high-end processors that they design — whereas Android phones might use slower processors — these fast processors are putting a greater demand on the battery,” he added. “I think that’s why it’s a problem that’s particularly unique to the iPhone.”
Yet Apple had not been forthcoming about slower speeds until this week, and, as CNN points out, the company doesn’t regularly notify you if your iPhone 6 battery is in poor health. (The company did alert some iPhone owners and replaced batteries for certain iPhone 6 users whose shutdown issues couldn’t be fixed by the software upgrade.)
Apple also announced the fix to the shutdown glitch early in 2017, and aging batteries were assumed to be the cause. But it didn’t mention anything specifically about slower phone speeds. That shadiness feeds the rumor mill that Apple is subtly trying to nudge you to get the shiny new iPhone.
That conspiracy existed long before Poole’s analysis. Google searches for “slow iPhone” spike around the time a new model comes out. In 2013, Catherine Rampell wrote in the New York Times that after the iPhone 5 came out, she “noticed that my sad old iPhone 4 was becoming a lot more sluggish”:
The battery was starting to run down much faster, too. But the same thing seemed to be happening to a lot of people who, like me, swear by their Apple products. When I called tech analysts, they said that the new operating system (iOS 7) being pushed out to existing users was making older models unbearably slow. Apple phone batteries, which have a finite number of charges in them to begin with, were drained by the new software. So I could pay Apple $79 to replace the battery, or perhaps spend 20 bucks more for an iPhone 5C. It seemed like Apple was sending me a not-so-subtle message to upgrade.
Tech bloggers have generally knocked the idea that Apple is torturing you with a crappy phone to get you to buy a new one. But they do say that newer software upgrades can mess with older phones because the new software is designed for, well, the newest model — the one with the fastest processor and the freshest battery. Usually Apple figures this out, and releases updates to fix as many glitches as possible. But it can’t remedy everything. And in the case of the iPhone 6 shutdowns, it had to find workarounds.
The counterpoint — well, maybe those phones shouldn’t be updated with the latest software if they are not fully compatible — isn’t totally convincing. As Rene Ritchie put it in a 2014 iMore article: “Phones and tablets that never get updated avoid the potential for slow down, but they also avoid getting new features, security updates, and the ability to run apps that require those updates.”
Apple’s latest admission probably won’t quell the conspiracies — or please customers. A class-action lawsuit, alleging breach of contract, was filed on Thursday in federal court.
There’s also the fact that Apple doesn’t make it easy to change or replace the battery. (Apple’s battery replacement costs $79 — not cheap, but not the cost of an iPhone X.)
But Poole said if it were easy to replace, then the iPhone wouldn’t be an iPhone. A replaceable battery would have to be thicker, and the phone would have an obvious battery cover. “I think it’s the trade-off that Apple makes,” he said. “They want the very thin, very light, very sleek phones. And by making the battery non-replaceable, they’re able to accomplish that.”"ÿÿApple admitted it’s slowing down certain iPhones

Apple has been sabotaging devices for years with software ""upgrades"" that slow every iPhone and iPad except the very latest model. It's a strategy called planned obsolescence, and its one of the ways that Apple and other gadget makers are getting so filthy rich while the planet and everyone else pays.
iOS 11.2.1 was released in early December. Anyone with a perfectly functional iPhone or iPad bought two years ago would do well to ignore the prompts to ""Install Now"". But Apple will be pushing upgrade notices to millions of those customers anyway, because every frustrated user with a sluggish device is another sales prospect.
Apple -- the most valuable company in the world -- could easily extend the life of older devices. The company simply has to stop aggressively pushing software ""upgrades"" to devices which will become significantly slower as a result. And ""downgrades"" need to be possible without computer hacking skills, so iPhone and iPad users can always get back to the way things were before if needed.
Tell Apple to ditch planned obsolescence, and help customers who want to extend the life of their iPhone or iPad -- to save money and save the planet.
Apple plays up its green credentials, but the truth is that Apple only began investing in renewable energy, and phasing out toxic chemicals when public pressure became too strong to ignore. People power did it before, and we can do it again.
One weird trick to install apps on older iPhones and iPads
Apps for iPhone and iPads often seem to require the latest version of iOS, but there's an undocumented trick to download older versions of apps if your device is running on an older version of iOS. It won't work with all apps, and Apple won't tell you about this method. But here's how it works:
* Open iTunes on your computer, and search for the app you want for your iPhone or iPad. Make sure you are using the same iTunes account you use on your device., * Now click to download the app to your computer, but do not attach your iPhone or iPad to the computer., * On your iPhone or iPad, go to the App Store and search for the app. Tap the cloud icon to download and install the app onto your device., * Finally - if you are in luck - you will see a prompt that says there is an older version of the app you can use. Tap download and you're done!,
Weird tricks like this should not be necessary. But they are proof that older iPhones and iPads could last longer if Apple would ditch planned obsolescence.

As vague ""unidentified sources"" continue to leak information about Apple's forthcoming tablet device, the company's former marketing manager has revealed supposed secrets on how the Cupertino, Calif., company operates. John Martellaro provided an analysis for The Mac Observer this week, giving insight into how Monday's leak on the tablet might have been given to The Wall Street Journal. Earlier this week, the paper reported that Apple will unveil its touchscreen tablet this month, and release it for sale in March. According to Martellaro, the story ""had all the earmarks of a controlled leak."" As a former senior marketing manager at Apple, he said he was told to leak information in the past. He said a senior company executive would ask him to release specific information to a trusted person at a major media outlet. Martellaro claims he was asked to ""idly mention"" the information in a telephone conversation, and to suggest to a reporter that publishing it would be ""nice."" E-mail correspondence was not allowed. ""The communication is always done in person or on the phone. Never via e-mail,"" he said. ""That's so that if there's ever any dispute about what transpired, there's no paper trail to contradict either party's version of the story. Both sides can maintain plausible deniability and simply claim a misunderstanding. That protects Apple and the publication."" The Journal's top technology commentator, Walt Mossberg, was bypassed, Martellaro alleged, to allow him to remain ""above the fray."" In addition, the story was leaked late Monday, after the stock market closed, so no one could suggest there was an attempt to manipulate Wall Street. Martellaro suggested there are a number of reasons Apple could have chosen to leak the information on Monday. They include, in his words:to light a fire under a recalcitrant partnerto float the idea of the US$1,000 price point and gauge reactionto panic/confuse a potential competitor about whom Apple had some knowledgeto whet analyst and observer expectations to make sure the right kind and number of people show up at the (presumed) January 26 event. Apple hates empty seats and demands SRO at these events While Apple sometimes leaks information to its advantage, it also goes to great lengths to control what is publicly said, and when. Apple's tight-lipped nature was profiled last year by the New York Times, which said the company's veil of secrecy began to take shape around the release of the original Macintosh back in 1984. One employee said that employees working on secret projects at Apple must ""pass through a maze of security doors, swiping their badges again and again and finally entering a numeric code to reach their offices."" Once inside the top-secret areas, employees are often monitored by surveillance cameras as they work. Those working with the most sensitive projects are allegedly instructed to ""cover up devices with black cloaks when they are working on them, and turn on a red warning light when devices are unmasked so that everyone knows to be extra-careful."" Last month, one report highlighted Apple's supposed ""Worldwide Loyalty Team,"" which are claimed to be a group of moles that spy on people and report directly to co-founder Steve Jobs and Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer. When an employee is suspected of a leak, the source claimed that they are under a ""gag order"" that involves the confiscation of cell phones and a total blackout of all unmonitored communication."ÿÿFormer Apple marketing manager describes company's 'controlled leaks'

Apple is cleaning up its energy act.
The computer company says that by early next year, the energy used to power its worldwide data centers will all come from renewable sources, such as solar, wind power, or hydro-electric dams. It announced the news Thursday in a post to its website.
That's a victory for the environmental activists at Greenpeace, who have been pressuring Apple for more than a year to clean up its act and commit to renewable energy.
A major sticking point has been Apple's Maiden, North Carolina, facility, which is on the inexpensive but partially coal-powered Duke Energy grid. Apple had already started building a 100-acre solar array and a biogas energy plant on the site, but was still using Duke for a large chunk of the power at the 500,000-square-foot data center.
Now, the company says it will instead use local power providers who use renewable energy. ""By the end of 2012, we'll meet the energy needs of our Maiden, North Carolina, data center using entirely renewable sources.""
The company now plans to build a second 100-acre solar array a few miles down the road from the facility, but it isn't saying when that will come online.
By year's end, about 60 percent of Maiden's energy will come from the solar farm and biogas plant. The other 40 percent will come from those unnamed renewable energy providers.
Greenpeace has stepped up its campaign against Apple in recent months. It sent cloud-cleaning activists to Apple stores in San Francisco, New York and Toronto last month, and on Tuesday, two Greenpeacers were arrested after setting up a giant iPod in front of Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters.
Greenpeace is happy with Thursday's announcement, but it's not stopping its campaign. ""Apple’s announcement today is a great sign that Apple is taking seriously the hundreds of thousands of its customers who have asked for an iCloud powered by clean energy, not dirty coal,"" a Greenpeace spokesman said in an e-mail message.
Greenpeace wants Apple — and Microsoft and Amazon too, for that matter – to promise to make renewable energy a priority even as it builds new data centers. ""Only then will customers have confidence that the iCloud will continue to get cleaner as it grows,"" Greenpeace said.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, but referred us to the company's new web page.
Apple says that another of its data centers, this one in Newark, California, will be 100 percent renewable by February 2013. A third data center, located just down the road from Facebook in Prineville, Oregon, will use wind, hydro and geothermal energy when it comes online. The company also runs data facilities in Austin, Texas, and Sacramento, California, both of which are plugged into the renewable grid, Apple says."ÿÿAfter Greenpeace Protests, Apple Promises to Dump Coal Power

Apple shareholders will vote on a resolution at the company’s annual meeting May 10 on a proposal to remove certain hazardous chemicals from their products.
Apple’s board says it opposes the resolution, arguing that it already has adequate environmental standards.
The resolution was submitted by Trillium Asset Management, of Boston, an investment firm that specializes in making socially responsible investments. It holds shares in Apple and also is a member of the Investor Environmental Health Network, which pressures public companies to remove toxic material from its products, including makers of computers, consumer electronics, fertilizer and cosmetics.
The shareholder resolution asks Apple to produce a report, within six months of the shareholder meeting, on the feasibility of “eliminating persistent and bioaccumulative toxic chemicals, and all types of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics” from its products.
Certain flame retardants used in circuit boards and PVCs have been shown to be toxic.
Dell has committed to eliminating the materials from its products by 2009 but Apple, while showing concern, has been less specific, said Steve Lippman, vice president of social research at Trillium.
“Apple has just lagged,” said Lippman. “They have said they are addressing the issue, but they haven’t set any timetables.”
Apple spokesman Steve Dowling said the company details on its Web site its environmental standards and lists hazardous chemicals it is phasing out of its products or already has.
In June 2006, Apple announced it would end shipments to Europe of certain products, including the eMac desktop computer and the AirPort wireless access point, because they didn’t comply with the European Union Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations (ROHS). Dowling said the eMac has been discontinued, the AirPort redesigned and that all its products are now RoHs-compliant.
In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Apple argues for a no vote on the proposal: “Apple recognizes the need for environmentally responsible production and has a record of restricting harmful substances that goes back over a decade,” it states.
Apple’s environmental policies have come under fire from Greenpeace, which launched a Web site campaign advocating that the company adopt more stringent guidelines. The environmental organization has repeatedly ranked Apple at the bottom of all technology companies on a scorecard that tracks use of hazardous chemicals, recycling, and take-back policies.
Environmental issues won’t be the only topic on the agenda for the May 10 shareholder meeting. Shareholders will also look at whether to change the rules on how stock options are granted in the wake of an ongoing probe into option accounting irregularities at Apple.

In an open letter to customers and shareholders, Apple chief executive Steve Jobs on Wednesday acknowledged that the company has not been forthright on its environmental policy and then finally proceeded to outline a timetable for the removal of toxic chemicals from the company's products.""Apple has been criticized by some environmental organizations for not being a leader in removing toxic chemicals from its new products, and for not aggressively or properly recycling its old products,"" said Jobs. ""Upon investigating Apple’s current practices and progress towards these goals, I was surprised to learn that in many cases Apple is ahead of, or will soon be ahead of, most of its competitors in these areas."" Regardless of the work that still needs doing, the Apple co-founder said it ""is certainly clear"" that Apple's policy of not trumpeting its future plans has left customers, shareholders, employees and the industry in the dark about its desires and plans to become greener. ""Our stakeholders deserve and expect more from us, and they’re right to do so,"" he wrote. ""They want us to be a leader in this area, just as we are in the other areas of our business. So today we’re changing our policy."" As part of its policy, Apple plans to completely eliminate the use of arsenic in its displays by the end of 2008 and will eventually eliminate the use of mercury by transitioning all of its displays to LED backlighting when technically and economically feasible. ""Fortunately, all iPod displays already use LEDs for illumination, and therefore contain no mercury,"" wrote Jobs. ""We plan to introduce our first Macs with LED backlight technology in 2007. Our ability to completely eliminate fluorescent lamps in all of our displays depends on how fast the LCD industry can transition to LED backlighting for larger displays."" By the end of 2008, Jobs said Apple also plans to completely eliminate the use of other toxic chemicals like polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a type of plastic primarily used in the construction industry but also found in computer parts and cables, and brominated flame retardants (BDRs), which reduce the risk of fire. In a comparative jab at Apple rivals, Jobs noted that while HP plans to remove PVC from all their packaging in the near future, Apple made the same move 12 years ago. Similarly, he said, Dell last year began the process of phasing out large quantities of brominated flame retardants in large plastic enclosure parts. For its part, Apple’s plastic enclosure parts have been bromine-free since 2002. ""In one environmental group’s recent scorecard, Dell, HP and Lenovo all scored higher than Apple because of their plans (or ""plans for releasing plans"" in the case of HP),"" quipped Jobs, referring to a report by environmental advocacy group Greenpeace. ""In reality, Apple is ahead of all of these companies in eliminating toxic chemicals from its products."" In regards to recycling, Jobs noted in his letter that Apple started recycling in 1994 and today operates recycling programs in countries where more than 82 percent of all Macs and iPods are sold. By the end of this year, that figure will increase to 93 percent, he said. While there is no industry standard way to measure of the effectiveness of a company’s recycling programs, Jobs seconded a method proposed by rival Dell, which is to assume a seven year product lifetime, and measure the percentage of the total weight a company recycles each year compared to the total weight of what it sold seven years earlier. ""This makes sense to us,"" said Jobs, ""and has the added advantages of clarity and simplicity.""Apple weight recycled as a % of past sales During the 2006 calendar year, Apple recycled 13 million pounds of e-waste, equal to 9.5 percent of the weight of all products Apple sold seven years earlier. Jobs said he expects that percentage to grow to 13 percent in 2007, and to 20 percent in 2008. By 2010, Apple's forecast calls for the recycling or 19 million pounds of e-waste per year, or nearly 30 percent of the product weight the firm sold seven years earlier. In another note of comparison to Apple rivals who have benchmarked higher in environmental advocacy ratings, Jobs said the latest e-waste figures from HP and Dell are each around 10 percent per year, with neither company having disclosed plans to grow that percentage in the future. The Apple headman suggests that by 2010, Apple may be recycling significantly more than either Dell or HP as a percentage of past sales weight. Jobs said that all of the e-waste Apple collects in North America is processed in the U.S., and nothing is shipped overseas for disposal. ""We carefully review 'environmental fate' submissions from each vendor, so we know how raw materials are handled at the end of the recycling process,"" he wrote. ""We hold our recycling vendors to the highest environmental standards in the industry. In addition to annual compliance audits, we also review the performance of their downstream vendors."" Jobs also called on system designers to ""take responsibility"" for their design and material choices in creating new products, and singled out the iMac as ""a world-class example of material efficiency,"" given that it has shed 60 percent of its weight since its inception back in 1998. Speaking on the subject of iPods, Jobs said Apple this summer will expand its free iPod take back program —which offers customers a 10 percent discount on a new iPod when they bring their old iPod to one of the company's 150+ U.S.-based retail stores —to all of its retail stores worldwide. The program extension will also include free shipping from anywhere in the U.S. Going forward, the Apple chief executive promised to provide updates on the company's environmental efforts and accomplishments at least annually, most likely around Spring time. ""I hope you are as delighted as I was when I first learned how far along Apple actually is in removing toxic chemicals from its products and recycling its older products,"" Jobs said in closing. ""We apologize for leaving you in the dark for this long.""Readers can view Steve's letter in its entirety at Apple.com or download it as PDF."ÿÿSteve Jobs unveils Apple's environmental policy

— Apple, the world’s most profitable technology company, doesn’t design iPhones here. It doesn’t run AppleCare customer service from this city. And it doesn’t manufacture MacBooks or iPads anywhere nearby.
Yet, with a handful of employees in a small office here in Reno, Apple has done something central to its corporate strategy: it has avoided millions of dollars in taxes in California and 20 other states.
Apple’s headquarters are in Cupertino, Calif. By putting an office in Reno, just 200 miles away, to collect and invest the company’s profits, Apple sidesteps state income taxes on some of those gains.
California’s corporate tax rate is 8.84 percent. Nevada’s? Zero.
Setting up an office in Reno is just one of many legal methods Apple uses to reduce its worldwide tax bill by billions of dollars each year. As it has in Nevada, Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places like Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands — some little more than a letterbox or an anonymous office — that help cut the taxes it pays around the world.
Almost every major corporation tries to minimize its taxes, of course. For Apple, the savings are especially alluring because the company’s profits are so high. Wall Street analysts predict Apple could earn up to $45.6 billion in its current fiscal year — which would be a record for any American business.

Apple serves as a window on how technology giants have taken advantage of tax codes written for an industrial age and ill suited to today’s digital economy. Some profits at companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft derive not from physical goods but from royalties on intellectual property, like the patents on software that makes devices work. Other times, the products themselves are digital, like downloaded songs. It is much easier for businesses with royalties and digital products to move profits to low-tax countries than it is, say, for grocery stores or automakers. A downloaded application, unlike a car, can be sold from anywhere.
The growing digital economy presents a conundrum for lawmakers overseeing corporate taxation: although technology is now one of the nation’s largest and most valued industries, many tech companies are among the least taxed, according to government and corporate data. Over the last two years, the 71 technology companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index — including Apple, Google, Yahoo and Dell — reported paying worldwide cash taxes at a rate that, on average, was a third less than other S.& P. companies’. (Cash taxes may include payments for multiple years.)
Even among tech companies, Apple’s rates are low. And while the company has remade industries, ignited economic growth and delighted customers, it has also devised corporate strategies that take advantage of gaps in the tax code, according to former executives who helped create those strategies.
Apple, for instance, was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed them to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes, according to former executives. Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the “Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich,” which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean. Today, that tactic is used by hundreds of other corporations — some of which directly imitated Apple’s methods, say accountants at those companies.
Without such tactics, Apple’s federal tax bill in the United States most likely would have been $2.4 billion higher last year, according to a recent study by a former Treasury Department economist, Martin A. Sullivan. As it stands, the company paid cash taxes of $3.3 billion around the world on its reported profits of $34.2 billion last year, a tax rate of 9.8 percent. (Apple does not disclose what portion of those payments was in the United States, or what portion is assigned to previous or future years.)
By comparison, Wal-Mart last year paid worldwide cash taxes of $5.9 billion on its booked profits of $24.4 billion, a tax rate of 24 percent, which is about average for non-tech companies.
Apple’s domestic tax bill has piqued particular curiosity among corporate tax experts because although the company is based in the United States, its profits — on paper, at least — are largely foreign. While Apple contracts out much of the manufacturing and assembly of its products to other companies overseas, the majority of Apple’s executives, product designers, marketers, employees, research and development, and retail stores are in the United States. Tax experts say it is therefore reasonable to expect that most of Apple’s profits would be American as well. The nation’s tax code is based on the concept that a company “earns” income where value is created, rather than where products are sold.
However, Apple’s accountants have found legal ways to allocate about 70 percent of its profits overseas, where tax rates are often much lower, according to corporate filings.
Neither the government nor corporations make tax returns public, and a company’s taxable income often differs from the profits disclosed in annual reports. Companies report their cash outlays for income taxes in their annual Form 10-K, but it is impossible from those numbers to determine precisely how much, in total, corporations pay to governments. In Apple’s last annual disclosure, the company listed its worldwide taxes — which includes cash taxes paid as well as deferred taxes and other charges — at $8.3 billion, an effective tax rate of almost a quarter of profits.
However, tax analysts and scholars said that figure most likely overstated how much the company would hand to governments because it included sums that might never be paid. “The information on 10-Ks is fiction for most companies,” said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College who specializes in multinational taxation. “But for tech companies it goes from fiction to farcical.”
Apple, in a statement, said it “has conducted all of its business with the highest of ethical standards, complying with applicable laws and accounting rules.” It added, “We are incredibly proud of all of Apple’s contributions.”
Apple “pays an enormous amount of taxes, which help our local, state and federal governments,” the statement also said. “In the first half of fiscal year 2012, our U.S. operations have generated almost $5 billion in federal and state income taxes, including income taxes withheld on employee stock gains, making us among the top payers of U.S. income tax.”
The statement did not specify how it arrived at $5 billion, nor did it address the issue of deferred taxes, which the company may pay in future years or decide to defer indefinitely. The $5 billion figure appears to include taxes ultimately owed by Apple employees.
The sums paid by Apple and other tech corporations is a point of contention in the company’s backyard.
A mile and a half from Apple’s Cupertino headquarters is De Anza College, a community college that Steve Wozniak, one of Apple’s founders, attended from 1969 to 1974. Because of California’s state budget crisis, De Anza has cut more than a thousand courses and 8 percent of its faculty since 2008.
Now, De Anza faces a budget gap so large that it is confronting a “death spiral,” the school’s president, Brian Murphy, wrote to the faculty in January. Apple, of course, is not responsible for the state’s financial shortfall, which has numerous causes. But the company’s tax policies are seen by officials like Mr. Murphy as symptomatic of why the crisis exists.
“I just don’t understand it,” he said in an interview. “I’ll bet every person at Apple has a connection to De Anza. Their kids swim in our pool. Their cousins take classes here. They drive past it every day, for Pete’s sake.
“But then they do everything they can to pay as few taxes as possible.”
Escaping State Taxes
In 2006, as Apple’s bank accounts and stock price were rising, company executives came here to Reno and established a subsidiary named Braeburn Capital to manage and invest the company’s cash. Braeburn is a variety of apple that is simultaneously sweet and tart.
Brian Murphy, center, head of De Anza College in Cupertino, Calif., says the big tech firms are “philosophically antitax, and it’s decimating the state.”

Today, Braeburn’s offices are down a narrow hallway inside a bland building that sits across from an abandoned restaurant. Inside, there are posters of candy-colored iPods and a large Apple insignia, as well as a handful of desks and computer terminals.
When someone in the United States buys an iPhone, iPad or other Apple product, a portion of the profits from that sale is often deposited into accounts controlled by Braeburn, and then invested in stocks, bonds or other financial instruments, say company executives. Then, when those investments turn a profit, some of it is shielded from tax authorities in California by virtue of Braeburn’s Nevada address.
Since founding Braeburn, Apple has earned more than $2.5 billion in interest and dividend income on its cash reserves and investments around the globe. If Braeburn were located in Cupertino, where Apple’s top executives work, a portion of the domestic income would be taxed at California’s 8.84 percent corporate income tax rate.
But in Nevada there is no state corporate income tax and no capital gains tax.
What’s more, Braeburn allows Apple to lower its taxes in other states — including Florida, New Jersey and New Mexico — because many of those jurisdictions use formulas that reduce what is owed when a company’s financial management occurs elsewhere. Apple does not disclose what portion of cash taxes is paid to states, but the company reported that it owed $762 million in state income taxes nationwide last year. That effective state tax rate is higher than the rate of many other tech companies, but as Ms. Clausing and other tax analysts have noted, such figures are often not reliable guides to what is actually paid.
Dozens of other companies, including Cisco, Harley-Davidson and Microsoft, have also set up Nevada subsidiaries that bypass taxes in other states. Hundreds of other corporations reap similar savings by locating offices in Delaware.
But some in California are unhappy that Apple and other California-based companies have moved financial operations to tax-free states — particularly since lawmakers have offered them tax breaks to keep them in the state.
In 1996, 1999 and 2000, for instance, the California Legislature increased the state’s research and development tax credit, permitting hundreds of companies, including Apple, to avoid billions in state taxes, according to legislative analysts. Apple has reported tax savings of $412 million from research and development credits of all sorts since 1996.
Then, in 2009, after an intense lobbying campaign led by Apple, Cisco, Oracle, Intel and other companies, the California Legislature reduced taxes for corporations based in California but operating in other states or nations. Legislative analysts say the change will eventually cost the state government about $1.5 billion a year.
Such lost revenue is one reason California now faces a budget crisis, with a shortfall of more than $9.2 billion in the coming fiscal year alone. The state has cut some health care programs, significantly raised tuition at state universities, cut services to the disabled and proposed a $4.8 billion reduction in spending on kindergarten and other grades.
Apple declined to comment on its Nevada operations. Privately, some executives said it was unfair to criticize the company for reducing its tax bill when thousands of other companies acted similarly. If Apple volunteered to pay more in taxes, it would put itself at a competitive disadvantage, they argued, and do a disservice to its shareholders.
Indeed, Apple’s decisions have yielded benefits. After announcing one of the best quarters in its history last week, the company said it had net profits of $24.7 billion on revenues of $85.5 billion in the first half of the fiscal year, and more than $110 billion in the bank, according to company filings.
A Global Tax Strategy
Every second of every hour, millions of times each day, in living rooms and at cash registers, consumers click the “Buy” button on iTunes or hand over payment for an Apple product.
And with that, an international financial engine kicks into gear, moving money across continents in the blink of an eye. While Apple’s Reno office helps the company avoid state taxes, its international subsidiaries — particularly the company’s assignment of sales and patent royalties to other nations — help reduce taxes owed to the American and other governments.
For instance, one of Apple’s subsidiaries in Luxembourg, named iTunes S.à r.l., has just a few dozen employees, according to corporate documents filed in that nation and a current executive. The only indication of the subsidiary’s presence outside is a letterbox with a lopsided slip of paper reading “ITUNES SARL.”
Luxembourg has just half a million residents. But when customers across Europe, Africa or the Middle East — and potentially elsewhere — download a song, television show or app, the sale is recorded in this small country, according to current and former executives. In 2011, iTunes S.à r.l.’s revenue exceeded $1 billion, according to an Apple executive, representing roughly 20 percent of iTunes’s worldwide sales.
The advantages of Luxembourg are simple, say Apple executives. The country has promised to tax the payments collected by Apple and numerous other tech corporations at low rates if they route transactions through Luxembourg. Taxes that would have otherwise gone to the governments of Britain, France, the United States and dozens of other nations go to Luxembourg instead, at discounted rates.
“We set up in Luxembourg because of the favorable taxes,” said Robert Hatta, who helped oversee Apple’s iTunes retail marketing and sales for European markets until 2007. “Downloads are different from tractors or steel because there’s nothing you can touch, so it doesn’t matter if your computer is in France or England. If you’re buying from Luxembourg, it’s a relationship with Luxembourg.”
An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the Luxembourg operations.
Downloadable goods illustrate how modern tax systems have become increasingly ill equipped for an economy dominated by electronic commerce. Apple, say former executives, has been particularly talented at identifying legal tax loopholes and hiring accountants who, as much as iPhone designers, are known for their innovation. In the 1980s, for instance, Apple was among the first major corporations to designate overseas distributors as “commissionaires,” rather than retailers, said Michael Rashkin, Apple’s first director of tax policy, who helped set up the system before leaving in 1999.
To customers the designation was virtually unnoticeable. But because commissionaires never technically take possession of inventory — which would require them to recognize taxes — the structure allowed a salesman in high-tax Germany, for example, to sell computers on behalf of a subsidiary in low-tax Singapore. Hence, most of those profits would be taxed at Singaporean, rather than German, rates.
The Double Irish
In the late 1980s, Apple was among the pioneers in creating a tax structure — known as the Double Irish — that allowed the company to move profits into tax havens around the world, said Tim Jenkins, who helped set up the system as an Apple European finance manager until 1994.
Apple created two Irish subsidiaries — today named Apple Operations International and Apple Sales International — and built a glass-encased factory amid the green fields of Cork. The Irish government offered Apple tax breaks in exchange for jobs, according to former executives with knowledge of the relationship.
But the bigger advantage was that the arrangement allowed Apple to send royalties on patents developed in California to Ireland. The transfer was internal, and simply moved funds from one part of the company to a subsidiary overseas. But as a result, some profits were taxed at the Irish rate of approximately 12.5 percent, rather than at the American statutory rate of 35 percent. In 2004, Ireland, a nation of less than 5 million, was home to more than one-third of Apple’s worldwide revenues, according to company filings. (Apple has not released more recent estimates.)
Moreover, the second Irish subsidiary — the “Double” — allowed other profits to flow to tax-free companies in the Caribbean. Apple has assigned partial ownership of its Irish subsidiaries to Baldwin Holdings Unlimited in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven, according to documents filed there and in Ireland. Baldwin Holdings has no listed offices or telephone number, and its only listed director is Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer, who lives and works in Cupertino. Baldwin apples are known for their hardiness while traveling.

Finally, because of Ireland’s treaties with European nations, some of Apple’s profits could travel virtually tax-free through the Netherlands — the Dutch Sandwich — which made them essentially invisible to outside observers and tax authorities.
Robert Promm, Apple’s controller in the mid-1990s, called the strategy “the worst-kept secret in Europe.”
It is unclear precisely how Apple’s overseas finances now function. In 2006, the company reorganized its Irish divisions as unlimited corporations, which have few requirements to disclose financial information.
However, tax experts say that strategies like the Double Irish help explain how Apple has managed to keep its international taxes to 3.2 percent of foreign profits last year, to 2.2 percent in 2010, and in the single digits for the last half-decade, according to the company’s corporate filings.
Apple declined to comment on its operations in Ireland, the Netherlands and the British Virgin Islands.
Apple reported in its last annual disclosures that $24 billion — or 70 percent — of its total $34.2 billion in pretax profits were earned abroad, and 30 percent were earned in the United States. But Mr. Sullivan, the former Treasury Department economist who today writes for the trade publication Tax Analysts, said that “given that all of the marketing and products are designed here, and the patents were created in California, that number should probably be at least 50 percent.”
If profits were evenly divided between the United States and foreign countries, Apple’s federal tax bill would have increased by about $2.4 billion last year, he said, because a larger amount of its profits would have been subject to the United States’ higher corporate income tax rate.
“Apple, like many other multinationals, is using perfectly legal methods to keep a significant portion of their profits out of the hands of the I.R.S.,” Mr. Sullivan said. “And when America’s most profitable companies pay less, the general public has to pay more.”
Other tax experts, like Edward D. Kleinbard, former chief of staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, have reached similar conclusions.
“This tax avoidance strategy used by Apple and other multinationals doesn’t just minimize the companies’ U.S. taxes,” said Mr. Kleinbard, now a professor of tax law at the University of Southern California. “It’s German tax and French tax and tax in the U.K. and elsewhere.”
One downside for companies using such strategies is that when money is sent overseas, it cannot be returned to the United States without incurring a new tax bill.
However, that might change. Apple, which holds $74 billion offshore, last year aligned itself with more than four dozen companies and organizations urging Congress for a “repatriation holiday” that would permit American businesses to bring money home without owing large taxes. The coalition, which includes Google, Microsoft and Pfizer, has hired dozens of lobbyists to push for the measure, which has not yet come up for vote. The tax break would cost the federal government $79 billion over the next decade, according to a Congressional report.
Fallout in California
In one of his last public appearances before his death, Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, addressed Cupertino’s City Council last June, seeking approval to build a new headquarters.
Most of the Council was effusive in its praise of the proposal. But one councilwoman, Kris Wang, had questions.
How will residents benefit? she asked. Perhaps Apple could provide free wireless Internet to Cupertino, she suggested, something Google had done in neighboring Mountain View.
“See, I’m a simpleton. I’ve always had this view that we pay taxes, and the city should do those things,” Mr. Jobs replied, according to a video of the meeting. “That’s why we pay taxes. Now, if we can get out of paying taxes, I’ll be glad to put up Wi-Fi.”
He suggested that, if the City Council were unhappy, perhaps Apple could move. The company is Cupertino’s largest taxpayer, with more than $8 million in property taxes assessed by local officials last year.
Ms. Wang dropped her suggestion.
Cupertino, Ms. Wang said in an interview, has real financial problems. “We’re proud to have Apple here,” said Ms. Wang, who has since left the Council. “But how do you get them to feel more connected?”
Other residents argue that Apple does enough as Cupertino’s largest employer and that tech companies, in general, have buoyed California’s economy. Apple’s workers eat in local restaurants, serve on local boards and donate to local causes. Silicon Valley’s many millionaires pay personal state income taxes. In its statement, Apple said its “international growth is creating jobs domestically, since we oversee most of our operations from California.”
“The vast majority of our global work force remains in the U.S.,” the statement continued, “with more than 47,000 full-time employees in all 50 states.”
Moreover, Apple has given nearby Stanford University more than $50 million in the last two years. The company has also donated $50 million to an African aid organization. In its statement, Apple said: “We have contributed to many charitable causes but have never sought publicity for doing so. Our focus has been on doing the right thing, not getting credit for it. In 2011, we dramatically expanded the number of deserving organizations we support by initiating a matching gift program for our employees.”
Still, some, including De Anza College’s president, Mr. Murphy, say the philanthropy and job creation do not offset Apple’s and other companies’ decisions to circumvent taxes. Within 20 minutes of the financially ailing school are the global headquarters of Google, Facebook, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco.
“When it comes time for all these companies — Google and Apple and Facebook and the rest — to pay their fair share, there’s a knee-jerk resistance,” Mr. Murphy said. “They’re philosophically antitax, and it’s decimating the state.”
“But I’m not complaining,” he added. “We can’t afford to upset these guys. We need every dollar we can get.”"ÿÿApple’s Tax Strategy Aims at Low-Tax States and Nations

Leading up to Apple CEO Tim Cook’s testimony on his company’s dubious-if-legal tax strategies tomorrow, here’s the report (pdf) members of Congress are up in arms about.
1. Almost all of Apple’s foreign operations are run through an Irish company with no employees.
The company told investigators that it lost all records concerning why Apple Operations International was originally set up in 1980, and why all of Apple global sales go through it. You might have a few ideas why if you keep reading.
2. Apple pays 2%—or less—in corporate income tax in Ireland.
The already low-tax country gives Apple special treatment with a negotiated 2% income tax rate. But that’s just the top-line number: Between 2009 and 2011, one Irish subsidiary, Apple Sales International, earned $38 billion and paid $21 million in taxes, for an effective rate of .06%.
3. Apple Operations International, which provided 30% of Apple’s worldwide net profits from 2009 to 2011, doesn’t pay taxes anywhere.
This move is devilishly brilliant: The US decides if it can tax you based on where you incorporate your company. Ireland decides if it can tax you based on the location of the people managing the company. So if you incorporate a subsidiary in Ireland, and manage it from the US, you don’t (so far) have to pay taxes in either country. And that’s exactly what Apple has done, not filing a tax return for AOI anywhere in the world in the last five years.
4. Apple’s US profits keep ending up in Ireland, too.
The report alleges more than just the avoidance of US taxes on foreign sales of Apple’s products. It also argues that Apple is effectively sending US profits to its Irish subsidiaries, too. How? Transfer pricing. Apple has set up a cost-sharing agreement with its Irish subsidiaries that gives them a disproportionate share of the profit from research and development that occurs in the United States. From 2009 to 2012, Apple allocated $4 billion in R&D costs to its US unit, which had $38.7 billion in profits, while its Irish subsidiary had $4.9 billion in R&D costs—and $74 billion in profits.
5. Most of the $102 billion Apple is keeping “overseas” is in US banks.
Just as its Irish companies are managed by US employees, Apple’s Irish cash is mostly kept in US financial institutions, largely managed by Braeburn Capital, Apple’s financial engineering nexus in Nevada.
6. The magic of “check-the-box” makes whole companies disappear
One of the most favored tax loop-holes for multinationals is known as “check-the-box.” It allows companies to instruct the government to completely disregard certain foreign subsidiaries for tax purposes. Apple’s main Irish subsidiary, AOI, checks the box for its entire global distribution network. This allowed the company to avoid paying $12.5 billion in taxes that would have been assessed for foreign sales by its network of global distributors.
7. Apple is seemingly terrible at estimating its own taxes
In annual reports between 2009 and 2011, the company told investors it was setting aside $13.7 billion to pay federal taxes—but it has actually paid only $5.3 billion. Those set-asides are only advance estimates, but it’s pretty strange that each year they’re off by many billions of dollars. As a result, Apple’s actual US tax rate is only 20.1%, much lower than the 24% to 32% it said it was paying. Absent this congressional investigation, we wouldn’t know the difference."ÿÿThe seven craziest findings in the US investigation of Apple’s tax avoidance practices

Apple CEO Tim Cook went to Washington on Tuesday and calmly defended the tech giant from a scathing Senate panel's report that concluded the company, famed for its iPhones and iPads, had become similarly infamous for corporate tax avoidance.
Cook, Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer and Phillip Bullock, the company's head of tax operations, were sworn in shortly before noon as star witnesses testifying in a public hearing showdown with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
UPDATE:Apple's tax ingenuity a tough sell
HIGHLIGHTS:Apple CEO Tim Cook testifies
""We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar,"" said Cook, who also insisted that Apple doesn't rely on tax ""gimmicks"" and doesn't ""stash money on some Caribbean island.""
Cook also sketched a proposal for a revenue-neutral simplification of federal tax laws that would lower corporate tax rates to roughly 25% and create a ""single-digit"" percentage tax on foreign earnings that multinational U.S. firms bring home to use for job creation
and economic investment. On paper, U.S. corporations are taxed 35% on worldwide income. But levies on overseas income are deferred until the funds are brought back to the U.S.
Such a change ""would likely result in an increase in Apple's U.S. taxes,"" said Cook, who noted that the company's $6 billion federal tax payment last year likely made it America's largest corporate tax payer.
The testimony came in response to the Senate panel's Monday report that said Apple avoided tens of billions of dollars in U.S. taxes on its income by shifting the funds through a global web of offshore entities — including three that had no tax residency in any nation.
The three entities were run by some of Apple's top executives but were located, on paper, in Ireland, though they in some cases had no employees. One reported $30 billion in net income for 2009-2012, yet filed no corporate tax return and paid no income taxes to any government during those years, according to the report.
Another affiliate received $74 billion in sales income over four years, but paid taxes ""on only a tiny fraction of that income,"" the report said.
Apple also transferred economic rights for some of its intellectual property to its offshore affiliates in low-tax jurisdictions, saving tens of billions of dollars in levies, the Senate panel concluded in its latest look at corporate tax avoidance tactics.
The company then went a step further by using U.S. tax loopholes to avoid federal taxes on $44 billion in otherwise taxable offshore income from the intellectual property rights during the past four years, the report said.
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the subcommittee chairman, called Apple's quest for lower corporate taxes ""the Holy Grail of tax avoidance.""
""Apple is an American success story. Its products are justifiably well known and used throughout the world. Just like millions around the world, I carry an iPhone in my pocket,"" said Levin in the hearing's opening statement. ""The company's engineers and designers have a well-earned reputation for creativity. What may not be so well known is that Apple also has a highly developed tax avoidance system — a system through which it has amassed more than $100 billion in offshore cash in a tax haven.""
Arizona Sen. John McCain, the panel's ranking Republican, praised Apple as a tech giant and major U.S. corporation and taxpayer. But, McCain added, ""in my view, Apple has violated at least the spirit (of federal tax laws) if not the letter of the law."" McCain also said Congress was at fault for not simplifying the tax code.
Igniting the hearing's first political flash point, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said the subcommittee should ""apologize"" for ""bullying"" one of the greatest U.S. business success stories. ""This problem is solely created by the awful tax code,"" said Paul, who added that ""Congress should be on trial.""
""What we're talking about is what every company in America does, and that's minimizing their tax,"" said Paul, stressing that Apple has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Signaling tacit agreement, Cook testified he did not consider Apple's tax strategies ""to be a sham or abuse in any way."" Cook said he and the other Apple executives appeared voluntarily to give the company's tax views, and did not feel harassed.
In written testimony filed with the subcommittee on Monday, Apple said ""in accordance with U.S. law,"" the firm ""pays U.S. corporate income taxes on the profits earned from its sales in the U.S. and on the investment income of its controlled foreign corporations.""
In the statement, Apple said it does not move intellectual property to offshore tax havens and use that structure to sell products in the U.S., thereby ducking domestic taxes. The company, which reported $102.3 billion of its $145 billion in cash was held in offshore affiliates as of March 30, said it has that much money overseas ""because it sells the majority of its products outside the U.S.""
J. Richard Harvey, a tax expert at Villanova University School of Law, testified Tuesday that ""I suspect that what Apple has done is within the bounds of what's acceptable in international tax law."" But Harvey also said he nearly ""fell off my chair"" when he read an Apple statement to the Senate panel that insisted the firm did not rely on tax gimmicks.
Tax-avoidance techniques are commonly used by many large U.S.-based global firms as a legal way to reduce government levies at home and abroad. In a separate study last fall, the Senate panel reported that two other domestic tech giants, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, used such strategies to avoid billions in federal taxes.
In its Apple study, the Senate panel reported that Apple for the past decade has operated in Ireland with a specially negotiated tax rate of less than 2%, well below the country's 12% statutory rate.
Apple has several Ireland subsidiaries, including Apple Operations International, its top-tier offshore affiliate, and two sub-affiliates called Apple Operations Europe and Apple Sales International.
Incorporated in 1980, AOI ""has no physical presence"" in Ireland ""or any other address"" and doesn't have any employees, the Senate report said. Its board meetings have almost always been held in the U.S., and its assets are managed by an Apple subsidiary in Nevada.
""According to Apple, AOI's net income made up 30% of Apple's total worldwide net profits from 2009-2011, yet Apple also disclosed to the subcommittee that AOI did not pay any corporate income tax to any national government during that period,"" the report said.
Apple said in written replies to the committee that it had not determined whether AOI was managed and controlled in the U.S., which would make its profits taxable, the report said, noting that the subsidiary hadn't filed a corporate tax return in the past five years.
But Cook and other Apple executives testified Tuesday that AOI is functionally controlled and directed from Apple operations in the U.S.
AOI is a holding company to manage the financial operations and income of much of Apple's international sales, said Cook. Lower-tier foreign subsidiaries pay taxes on the sales at the rates charged by the countries in which they operate, and Apple pays U.S. tax on investment income generated by the money that flows to AOI, he said.
""The way I look at this is I see no shifting (of tax responsibility) going on,"" Cook said.
McCain questioned whether Apple's ability to take advantage of lower taxes in other countries where its products are sold gave the tech giant a financial advantage over domestic U.S. firms with no foreign operations.
""I don't see it as being unfair,"" Cook said.
The Senate panel has recommended strengthening the federal tax code to eliminate incentives for U.S. multinational firms to transfer intellectual property rights to offshore affiliates in low-tax areas.
In other recommendations, the panel called for reforming ""check the box"" tax rules and imposing current U.S. tax on income earned by any overseas affiliate managed and controlled in the U.S."ÿÿApple CEO defends tax tactics at Senate hearing

Despite all the makings of a global scandal Luxembourg is keeping its cool.
Nicolas Mackel, the top finance official for the rich tiny EU founding member state, said: “there is nothing unethical” going on.
This followed a report that more than 300 major companies secured secret deals from Luxembourg to slash their tax bills.
Apple was in the list. Last year it was found to have paid 3.7 percent tax on money made outside the US, using Irish companies.
According to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the companies appear to have channelled hundreds of billions of euros through Luxembourg and saved billions of euros in taxes, based on a review of nearly 28,000 pages of leaked confidential documents — also known as comfort letters.
Luxembourg officials deny any “sweetheart deals” in its system, such as for, say, Amazon, the Internet-based American consumer goods giant. It declared revenues in Europe last year of 20 billion euros, and has had an agreement with the Grand Duchy since 2003 to channel some of that through at a rate of 5.3 percent.
Luxembourg denies practising tax favouritism.
Ikea, the Swedish ready-to-assemble furniture multinational, has long attracted admiration for designing its tax-paying architecture equally cleverly. It handles this in Luxembourg first, and also in the Netherlands, Belgium, Cyprus, havens in the Caribbean and Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
The intricacy of complex systems like this makes them difficult for tax authorities to figure out in the countries where multinationals do very substantial business.
The ICIJ report also named Pepsi as a top weaver of creative but legal tax-reduction systems.
The European Commission is probing whether these practices amount to illegal state aid under European Union rules.
Euronews reporter Olivier Péguy spoke to Anne Michel, one of the journalists at French newspaper Le Monde, who uncovered some of the tax evasion schemes.
Olivier Péguy, euronews: In your investigation, you looked at the case of Ikea. How much do you estimate the company saved through its tax deals with Luxembourg?
Anne Michel, Le Monde: It’s very difficult to estimate the amount that Ikea and the other multinationals that we investigated have saved on tax, because the tax deals are only a small part of the tax evasion package which has been set up. Nonetheless, in one of the tax deals that we analysed, we can tell that a package has been put in place which allows dividends worth around 5 billion euros to be paid to an Ikea shareholder which turns out to be a foundation established in Lichtenstein which is also totally tax exempt. We can estimate that the tax gains of just this one operation are around 730 million euros.
euronews: Which system is most often used by companies? Can you explain it?
Anne Michel: In fact Luxembourg is a bit like a tax tool box. There are various tax avoidance packages that are all very advantageous, like first of all the holding societies, their status is completely tax exempt or all of the financial instruments / tradable assets which are not taxed at all. In the end, the aim of all these systems is to get revenues transferred to Luxembourg which are organised in other countries to get a weak tax rate or even none at all.
euronews: Which well-know companies have used this system?
Anne Michel: In fact it’s mainly American multinationals like Apple, Amazon, Pepsi and Heinz but also European multinationals as we have said like Ikea. Regarding Ikea, what is very interesting – once again – is that we can tell, we can discover that the company has set up a tax evasion package which goes not only through Luxembourg but through a cluster of tax havens, the more exotic ones like Cyprus and Gibraltar.
euronews: Which are the countries allowing and carrying out these financial arrangements?
Anne Michel: Luxembourg isn’t the only one offering these very advantageous deals for multinationals. In fact three other countries have these tax avoidance measures, notably Holland and Ireland and Switzerland as well. But Luxembourg, along with Holland, is the most reluctant to reform its tax set up, whereas Ireland and Switzerland have begun to reform their most controversial tax evasion schemes.

The European Commission’s ruling against Apple’s tax arrangements in Ireland focuses on the particular corporate structure the US multinational used here. This structure was different in one key respect to that used by most other multinationals, even if the tax advantages which accrued were much the same.
Central to this is that Apple undertook key transactions within companies located here – rather than between two different subsidiaries. They did not use the traditional double Irish structure involving two companies – instead they used why you might call a “single Irish”, conducting key transactions within one company.
It may seem a subtle point, but it appears to be central to the commission’s decision.
To understand this, a bit of background is necessary. US multinationals here have typically used Irish-registered subsidiaries to take in the revenue from sales across Europe – and beyond in some cases. They have done this in a way which has sheltered much of this income from Irish corporation tax. Apple achieved this in a way that was slightly different to most of the other big tech players who have established here, even though the outcome was very similar.
Central to most of these structures – though not Apple’s – was the “double Irish”, the rule that allowed multinationals to register companies in Ireland but have them resident for tax purposes elsewhere. The double Irish is being phased out by 2020.
Intellectual property
Most multinationals worked the double Irish like this. They established one company registered in Ireland but tax resident elsewhere, often in a tax haven such as the Bahamas or Cayman Islands. This company “owned” the intellectual property (IP) rights for sales in Europe. In other words, it had an asset which represented all the research, development and marketing work done on whatever product was involved.
Typically, the multinational then had a second Irish company which took in the revenue from across Europe. This second company paid the first one a charge for the use of the IP . This charge usually represented a significant portion of revenue and so the profits declared by the second company – the one tax resident here – were typically low and most of the cash ended up in the company which was tax resident offshore.
This then left the US multinational with a pot of money sitting in a company tax resident offshore.
In this way, US companies especially have built up huge pots of cash that they usually keep offshore as, if they return them to the US, they would then typically be exposed to fairly onerous US corporation tax rates.
Apple’s structure here differed from the norm in one vital respect. There are two companies involved in the Commission decisions which are registered here, with the judgment referring to Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe. But, unlike most other multinationals, Apple did not put its IP for Europe and other non-US markets in a separate company.
Apple Sales International
Let’s look at one of the companies, Apple Sales International, which is the key player involved. Apple split the company into two “bits” – an Irish branch and an offshore head office, which was tax resident nowhere for the period under investigation. The IP was owned by the headquarters office. Apple, like other multinationals, levied a big charge on the profits earned elsewhere in Europe to account for the IP – the cost of developing its products – and used this to reduce the Irish tax on its earnings from Europe and beyond to very low levels.
But unlike the other big players it was moving money around within two bits of one company, rather than between two separate companies. And the agreement with the Revenue Commissioners that allowed Apple to allocate profits between an Irish branch and a headquarters all within one company was central to the commission’s adverse finding. It found that this was artificial and conferred a selective benefit to Apple – in other words it gave it a particular advantage not available to others.
Tax experts believe that had Apple used a traditional double Irish structure – moving money between companies rather than within them – it would probably have avoided the negative finding, which getting similat tax benefits. The full details of the Commission’s ruling may tell us more here.
Still, what we know invites two further questions. The first is whether other companies used the same structure as Apple. This is not clear, but tax experts here believe the vast majority availing of the traditional double Irish used the two-company structure.
The second question is whether the commission might look at the more traditional double Irish structure and examine how it was worked? So far it has not looked at other Irish companies and the fact the double Irish is being phased out may also be a factor.
Irish-based tax experts say the traditional double Irish structure would not, in most cases, have required the companies involved to seek an opinion from the Revenue. And it is the Revenue opinion which is central to the finding of illegal state aid having been conferred on Apple.
Why Apple’s Irish structure was slightly different to that used by most other companies is not clear. It may relate to historic corporate structures dated back to its establishment here in the 1980s. The effect of what it set up was exactly the same as the more traditional structure used by many other multinationals. But the commission has judged that Ireland offered it illegal state aid, highlighting – according to what we know so far – the specific details of how Apple’s peculiar structure worked. In this case, at least, the double Irish might have been better than the single."ÿÿApple’s Irish company structure key to EU tax finding

Ever hear of a Double Irish? It’s not a drink, but one of the dodgy tax strategies that help American companies keep their profits nearly tax-free abroad. Such strategies are at the heart of what may well turn out to be the most important corporate tax case in history, a case that could have a big impact on U.S.-E.U. relations and the future governance of multinational corporations.
The E.U. ruled Aug. 30 that Ireland, which offers multinational companies myriad incentives to operate there, must claw back billions of dollars in taxes from Apple. The record-breaking bill comes to $14.5 billion. The tech giant has been paying just 4% taxes per year on nearly $200 billion in foreign profits over the past decade. Apple’s is the largest chunk of the $1.2 trillion in profits that all U.S. companies are hoarding overseas — a cash pile that’s been building for years as companies try to avoid the higher-than-average U.S. corporate tax rate by jumping through overseas loopholes to keep profits abroad. Apple’s effective rate, reached through deals with the country in 1991 and 2007, is much lower than Ireland’s standard corporate tax rate — already the lowest in the E.U. at 12.5%. The company will fight the ruling vigorously.
Apple is only the most recent target for the E.U., which has also gone after Starbucks in the Netherlands and Fiat in Luxembourg. But the Apple case takes the fight over the tax “optimization” to a new level. For starters, it has opened a deeper rift in U.S.-E.U. economic relations. They weren’t so great to begin with. (The U.S. Treasury Department has asked the E.U. to back down on the Apple case, and there are threats of congressional tax retaliation against European firms in the U.S. if it goes ahead.) While it’s clear that the U.S. wants some of the money Apple is keeping abroad and is worried that the E.U. might get to it first, that’s a tricky argument for American authorities to make.
I suspect there are plenty of Americans (like me) who’d support the ideas behind the E.U.’s efforts to try to squash country-specific tax loopholes and bring multinationals to heel. In fact, I’d argue this is a good opportunity for the U.S. and the E.U. to work more closely together on tax harmonization and mutual rules for combatting the race to the bottom on taxes — after all, one of the reasons that corporations are able to tax-optimize is that they can arbitrage one nation’s system against another’s. This is not the road the current fight appears to currently be on, as rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic heats up. Irish authorities, caught in the middle and fearful of losing the jobs Apple provides there, are pushing back against the ruling.
The real problem is a global tax system run amok. International tax shenanigans have real-world consequences for Main Street. For starters, they distort the market. Even as big firms hoard cash abroad, they borrow money in the U.S. debt markets. Unfortunately most use that debt to fund share buybacks that enrich mainly the wealthiest Americans and add nothing to real productivity and economic growth. This only increases the wealth divide in America, widening the toxic rift between the markets and Main Street.
Their efforts have, perversely, been enabled by the low-interest-rate monetary policy of recent years, which itself was a reaction to the financial crisis. But there’s a big debate going on right now about when and how to raise those rates. Central bankers like Fed Chair Janet Yellen have made it clear that they’d like to see governments doing more to buoy the economy via fiscal policy, rather than relying on monetary policy to carry the load any longer. As she pointed out in her recent Jackson Hole speech, “Beyond monetary policy, fiscal policy has traditionally played an important role in dealing with severe economic downturns. A wide range of possible fiscal-policy tools and approaches could enhance the cyclical stability of the economy.” That’s Fed speak for, “Come on, Congress, get your act together, push through a real stimulus plan and stop passing the buck to the central bankers.”
But fiscal policy requires money. That means that rich country governments, which have ended up with record debts and shrinking public budgets in the wake of the 2008 crisis, will be looking much more closely at corporate tax avoidance. In an economic scenario where companies are flush but workers are not and the historical relationship between corporate profits and local economic growth looks broken — big companies are going to be under a lot more pressure to do more for the countries in which they operate. There is a growing sense that many companies have been flying 35,000 ft. over the economic troubles of the countries where they operate — and they should be forced back down to earth.
Apple’s tax bill is just the beginning of a very big fight between the world’s richest companies and its governments. But how the battle lines will be drawn is likely to be as confusing a problem as the international tax system itself.

Video
Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's commissioner for competition, discusses the decision calling for Apple to pay billions of euros in back taxes.
The European Union on Tuesday ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple, a record penalty that worsened tensions with the United States over the bloc’s crackdown on sweetheart deals with global multinationals.
Europe’s competition enforcer said that Apple’s illegal deals with the Irish government allowed the technology giant to pay virtually nothing on its European business in some years. The arrangements enabled Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to a “head office” with “no employees, no premises, no real activities,” the commission said.
By doing so, Apple paid only 50 euros in taxes for every million euros in profit during 2014. As part of its ruling, Europe demanded that Ireland recoup 10 years’ worth of back taxes, some 13 billion euros, or about $14.5 billion, plus interest.
The amount is a drop in the bucket for Apple, which has a total cash pile of more than $230 billion. Even so, the company described the order as a “devastating blow” to the rule of law. The United States Treasury Department said it jeopardized “the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the E.U.”
Since taking over as competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has made tax avoidance a central focus, a campaign that has also ensnared Starbucks in the Netherlands, Amazon in Luxembourg and Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium. The United States Treasury, one of the most vocal critics of these moves, has said that Europe is overstepping its power, unfairly targeting American companies and hurting global efforts to curtail tax avoidance.
The United States government is an unlikely advocate. Politicians have berated Apple for paying too little by setting up complex and opaque tax structures. Officials have hit back against corporate mergers that allowed companies to move their headquarters to places like Ireland to take advantage of lower tax rates.
But the positioning in the Apple case reflects a political tug of war over big profitable companies, their potential tax bounty and the rights to regulate them.
On Tuesday, Europe’s antitrust enforcer ordered Ireland to claw back billions from Apple over illegal tax breaks.

“U.S. companies are the grandmasters of tax avoidance,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.
“Nevertheless, because of the nature of U.S. politics,” he said, the Apple case “will be framed by the U.S. as Europe overreaching and discriminating against ‘our team.’”
Since early this year, Ms. Vestager and Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, and their teams have met regularly to discuss Europe’s state-aid tax investigations. Mr. Lew visited Brussels in July to put forward the American perspective.
Last week, the Treasury Department released a report criticizing any moves to recoup back taxes from American companies. Politicians also chimed in after the Apple decision.
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, called it a “cheap money grab” by the European Commission, “targeting U.S. businesses and the U.S. tax base.” The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Orrin G. Hatch, said that the decision “encroaches on U.S. tax jurisdiction.”
Apple and Ireland had similar defenses.
Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of the technology company, said that Europe’s ruling had “no basis in fact or in law,” and called it an effort to “rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process.” The company called the effective tax rate “a completely made-up number.”
The Finance Ministry of Ireland said that the commission’s decision would undermine a continuing global tax overhaul and create business uncertainty. The ministry said that taxes were a “fundamental matter of sovereignty.”
Ireland and Apple both said they intended to fight Europe’s decision, even though any appeals process could take years.
The commission said the amount due in Ireland could be reduced if the American authorities decided that Apple should have paid more tax in the United States. Other countries in the European Union could also potentially take a share.
“The ultimate goal should of course be that all companies, big or small, pay tax where they generate their profits,” the competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager, said at a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday. “We need a change in corporate philosophies and the right legislation to address loopholes and ensure transparency.”
Although the United States appears to side with Apple and Ireland in this specific fight, the overall view is a bit more complicated.
A United States Senate committee said in 2013 that Apple had negotiated a special corporate tax rate of 2 percent or less in Ireland. While the committee did not accuse Apple of breaking any laws, lawmakers criticized the “gimmicks,” “schemes” and complex corporate structures that allowed the company to sidestep taxes. The public scrutiny and the emergence of previously confidential information about Apple’s tax arrangements, in part, helped spark Europe’s own investigation into the issue.
Apple and other companies have also faced criticism for keeping large reserves of cash overseas. The money is not taxed at home until it is brought back to the parent company in the United States.
Nonfinancial American companies hold a combined $1.7 trillion in cash overseas, according to the credit rating agency Moody’s. Just the international piece of Apple’s stash amounts to nearly $215 billion.
Ireland has faced broad scrutiny for its tax appeal.
In a matter separate from the Apple case, the United States Treasury has taken aggressive steps to curtail so-called inversions, a tax move that has significantly benefited Ireland. Under those merger deals, an American company would buy an overseas counterpart and shift its headquarters overseas to lower its taxes.
Ireland, with its low corporate tax rate, has been an especially big winner with inversions. Such financial maneuvers helped plump up the country’s economy, which grew at a breakneck 26.3 percent last year.
Ireland’s corporate tax rate, at 12.5 percent, is one of the lowest in the developed world. Other incentives and breaks allow companies to cut their bills even further. While it is phasing out some of the more contested loopholes, Ireland has just introduced a new break for profit on intellectual property, a potentially huge benefit to large technology companies with troves of patents.
“Many member states are not unhappy about the European Commission’s investigations,” said Philipp Werner, a competition lawyer at Jones Day in Brussels. “They may help to close down tax havens.”

The Government’s appeal against the European Commission’s ruling on Apple’s tax arrangements in Ireland will rely on three major arguments.
Senior figures in Government, including Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Minister for Finance Michael Noonan, yesterday disclosed the core issues for the appeal, which is being prepared by Attorney General Maire Whelan.
The first is that the Revenue Commissioners acted in accordance with the law and treated all taxpayers equally, doing no deals or favours.
The Revenue Commissioners issued two opinions to Apple in Ireland, one in 1991 and the second in 2007. It was on that basis that Apple operated its tax structures.
A briefing paper will argue that the Revenue simply stated the operation of the applicable tax laws that were in place at the time.
A briefing paper prepared in advance of the decision set out this argument.
“While it is not possible to comment on the specific facts of the case which remain subject to taxpayer confidentiality, it is emphatically the case taht there was no departure from the applicable Irish tax law by Revenue... and that full tax due was paid in accordance with the law.”
Mr Noonan elaborated on this point yesterday: “The Revenue Commissioners acted in accordance with law. A minister for finance would not be worth his salt if he did not stand behind his Revenue Commissioners who acted legally.
Intrusion into sovereignty
The second major argument is that the EU Commission’s decision, ostensibly in the area of competition law, amounted to an intrusion into Ireland’s sovereignty, specifically its right to conduct its own tax affairs.
The Taoiseach put huge emphasis on this yesterday: “I regard this matter as questioning Ireland’s right as a sovereign nation to set out policies that are appropriate for Ireland. We stand over our 12.5 per cent corporate rate tax 100 per cent.”
Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe and Mr Noonan also laboured this point. The latter said: “Under the Treaties tax affairs are a competence for Sovereign governments. We are going to appeal on the basis that this is an intrusion beyond the competence of the Commission to intervene in these matters.
The final ground is a more technical one, but one on which Mr Noonan placed major emphasis yesterday.
He referred to the OECD guidelines on “arms length standards”. This refers to the practice of subsidiaries selling services or goods to other subsidiaries within an overall corporation. The arm’s length standard ensures the price point is pitched at a level that is realistic and close to market value. This has helped cut off elaborate schemes and loopholes used by companies for the purposes of tax avoidance.
Mr Noonan said that the guidelines only came into effect in 2010, yet the Commission wanted to apply it to periods up to two decades before when the rule did not exist.
In other words, he said, the Commission was trying to apply a guideline retrospectively in order to collect taxes. He contended this was wrong.
“Do you think it would be fair that if you did something in 2003 that was not a crime and it was made a crime in 2012, do you think it should be fair you should be arrested for it now and penalised?” he asked.
“How could any foreign direct investor come into Europe if they thought the valid arrangements they made under law could be overturned a generation later and they would be liable to pay back money? That is the essential key issue.”"ÿÿApple tax appeal: The three arguments  Government to  use

Reporters have unveiled some 13.4 million secret documents detailing evidence of tax avoidance among high-ranking politicians and the super wealthy. Some in US President Donald Trump's cabinet have been implicated.
Some 400 reporters from 67 countries have scoured 13.4 million secret documents and uncovered tax-avoidance techniques used by the super rich and high-ranking politicians, German media reported on Sunday.
The leaked data was obtained by German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which said that the majority of the documents stem from offshore law firm Appleby, which was founded in Bermuda but has offices in several other locations. The company reported last month that it had been hacked.

The documents, dubbed the Paradise Papers, appear to show ties between members of US President Donald Trump's cabinet and Russian firms.
Shrinking taxes
The documents also show that by using shell companies, corporations such as Nike, Apple, Uber and Facebook are able to shrink their taxes to low rates.
Rock star Bono, as well as British Queen Elizabeth II's private estate, has also been involved in offshore funds, Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.
Over 120 politicians from 47 countries are involved in the tax-avoidance schemes, the paper reported.
Economist Gabriel Zucman told the Süddeutsche Zeitung that the global elite have parked an estimated 7.9 trillion euros ($9.1 trillion) in offshore tax havens.
The data was published by a number of news organizations in cooperation with the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).

German ex-chancellor implicated
Data from the Paradise Papers shows that former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder had a management role at an offshore company.
In 2009, he was part of a so-called ""independent supervisory board"" of the Russian-British energy company TNK-BP, the documents show. The joint venture by Britain's BP and Russia's Alfa-Group was based, like many other oil joint-ventures, in the British Virgin Islands.

Schröder and two others on the board contacted Appleby ""about certain procedural company affairs under the laws of the British Virgin Islands,"" according to an email from a London-based lawyer in October 2011. Appleby declined to offer their services due to a conflict of interest with another client.

Several German companies also had dealings with Appleby, including car rental service Sixt, Deutsche Post (DHL), Siemens, Allianz and Deutsche Bank.
Panama Papers — the sequel
The Süddeutsche Zeitung was also involved in exposing the so-called Panama Papers leak last year.
The papers were initially leaked to the Süddeutsche Zeitung last year. The Panama Papers consist of some 11.5 million leaked documents implicating individuals stashing their wealth in offshore tax havens.
The documents revealed how Mossack Fonseca had created some 200,000 shell companies and listed the names of individuals, including politicians, celebrities and athletes, who had hidden their wealth in those companies."ÿÿParadise Papers expose tax schemes of global elite | DW | 05.11.2017

Tim Cook was angry.
It was May 2013, and Mr. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, appeared before a United States Senate investigative subcommittee. After a lengthy inquiry, the committee found that the company had avoided tens of billions of dollars in taxes by shifting profits into Irish subsidiaries that the panel’s chairman called “ghost companies.”
“We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar,” Mr. Cook declared at the hearing. “We don’t depend on tax gimmicks,” he went on. “We don’t stash money on some Caribbean island.”
True enough. The island Apple would soon rely on was in the English Channel.

Five months after Mr. Cook’s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income.
Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.
The previously undisclosed story of Apple’s search for a new tax haven and its use of Jersey is among the findings emerging from a cache of secret corporate records from Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm that caters to businesses and the wealthy elite.
The records, shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists with The New York Times and other media partners, were obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
The documents reveal how big law firms help clients weave their way through the gaps between different countries’ tax rules. Appleby clients have transferred trademarks, patent rights and other valuable assets into offshore shell companies, avoiding billions of dollars in taxes. The rights to Nike’s Swoosh trademark, Uber’s taxi-hailing app, Allergan’s Botox patents and Facebook’s social media technology have all resided in shell companies that listed as their headquarters Appleby offices in Bermuda and Grand Cayman, the records show.
“U.S. multinational firms are the global grandmasters of tax avoidance schemes that deplete not just U.S. tax collection but the tax collection of most every large economy in the world,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, a former corporate tax adviser to such companies who is now a law professor at the University of Southern California.
Indeed, tax strategies like the ones used by Apple — as well as Amazon, Google, Starbucks and others — cost governments around the world as much as $240 billion a year in lost revenue, according to a 2015 estimate by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The disclosures come on the heels of last week’s proposals by Republican lawmakers to provide several new tax benefits for multinational companies, including cutting the federal corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. President Trump has said that American businesses are getting a bad deal under current rules.
But the documents show how major American companies find creative ways to avoid paying anything close to 35 percent.
Apple, for example, pays taxes at a small fraction of that rate on its offshore profits, according to calculations by The Times based on the company’s securities filings. Apple reports that nearly 70 percent of its worldwide profits are earned offshore.
An Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, declined to answer most questions about the company’s tax strategy. He did say that Apple had told regulators — in the United States and Ireland and at the European Commission — about the reorganization of its Irish subsidiaries. “The changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country,” he said.
He added: “At Apple we follow the laws, and if the system changes we will comply. We strongly support efforts from the global community toward comprehensive international tax reform and a far simpler system.”
In prepared statements, Allergan, Facebook, Nike and Uber said they complied with tax regulations around the world.
Congressional Republicans are also seeking to impose a 10 percent tax on some of the profits that American businesses say are earned offshore — half the rate they are proposing for profits in the United States. The lawmakers have also proposed another break, permitting multinationals to bring home more than $2.6 trillion stowed offshore at sharply reduced tax rates. Both proposals, critics say, would only create additional incentives for businesses like Apple to shift more profits into island hideaways.

Appleby is a member of the global network of lawyers, accountants and bankers who set up or manage offshore companies and accounts for clients who want to avoid taxes or keep their finances a secret from authorities, business partners or even spouses. The firm did not respond to questions from The Times about its work for Apple or other companies.
Tax authorities have challenged several of the offshore structures maintained by Appleby and Estera, a spinoff of the law firm’s corporate services business. Nike won a fight over back taxes with the Internal Revenue Service a year ago. a similar dispute between the I.R.S. and Facebook is continuing.
European regulators are trying to force countries including Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to collect back taxes from big companies that relied on offshore arrangements. Apple is being pursued for $14.5 billion in back taxes after European regulators ruled that its old tax structure amounted to illegal state aid from the Irish government.
Seeking ‘the Holy Grail’
Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens. Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions — mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands — now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the world’s population.
Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.
In May 2013, the Senate’s investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apple’s tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared “tax residency” nowhere in the world.
Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is “managed and controlled” abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax. By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.
At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.
“Apple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,” then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.
Ireland’s finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his country’s policies: “I do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.” Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies. Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.
But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.
At that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries. Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year. Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.
Company officials wanted to keep it that way. So Apple sought alternatives to the tax arrangement Ireland would soon shut down. And the officials wanted to be quiet about it.
“For those of you who are not aware Apple are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,” wrote Cameron Adderley, global head of Appleby’s corporate department, in a March 20, 2014 email to other senior partners. “They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.”
In building Apple’s new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor. A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago. The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators. It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.
Baker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple. For Appleby, Mr. Adderley said, this assignment was “a tremendous opportunity for us to shine on a global basis with Baker McKenzie.”
Baker McKenzie’s San Francisco office emailed a 14-item questionnaire in March 2014 to Appleby’s offices in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.
“Confirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction,” the document requested. Baker McKenzie also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: “Are there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?”
(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, “As a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.”)
Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Appleby’s office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system. Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.
The ‘Double Irish’
But the plan to use Jersey faced a potential snag: In mid-2014, again under pressure from other governments, Irish ministers explored ending a tax shelter known as the “double Irish,” used by scores of companies, including the Appleby clients Allergan and Facebook, as well as Google, LinkedIn and other businesses.
The double Irish allows companies to collect profits through one subsidiary that employs people in Ireland, then route those profits to an Irish mailbox subsidiary that is a tax resident of an offshore haven like Bermuda, Grand Cayman or the Isle of Man.
Irish officials explored a ban on Irish companies claiming tax residency in tax havens. Executives at Allergan — which had used a double Irish for at least a decade, records show — tried to derail the rule change. Terilea Wielenga, then Allergan’s head of tax, was also international president of the Tax Executives Institute, a trade group. She argued to the Irish finance ministry in July 2014 that any such changes should occur slowly.
The campaign seemed to work. “For existing companies, there will be provision for a transition period until the end of 2020,” Mr. Noonan declared in October 2014. The gradual phase-in would apply not just to existing companies but to any new ones created by December of that year.
This gave Apple just enough time. By the end of the year, Jersey had become the new tax home of the Irish companies Apple Sales International and Apple Operations International.
But a third Apple subsidiary, Apple Operations Europe, became resident in Ireland.
Apple would not say why. But tax experts offer one possible reason. While media attention focused on Ireland’s crackdown on the double Irish, officials announced a new measure: The country expanded its tax deductions for companies that move rights to intellectual property — like patents and trademarks — into Ireland. If an Irish company spent $15 billion buying such rights, even from a fellow subsidiary, it could claim a $1 billion tax deduction each year for 15 years.
Apple declined to say whether it has availed itself of the new benefit.
But J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova law professor and former I.R.S. official who reviewed the Appleby documents, concluded that there was a strong possibility the company moved intellectual property into Ireland to take advantage of the generous tax rules. Based on Apple’s American securities filings, he estimated that the transfer was worth about $200 billion.
That would mean that any income that Apple now generates in Ireland could be partially offset by more than $13 billion in tax deductions each year for 15 years.
Apple’s hunt for a tax haven is a familiar tale, said Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, who also reviewed the Appleby documents.
“This is how it usually works: You close one tax shelter, and something else opens up,” he said. “It just goes on endlessly.”

The huge focus on the taxation of corporate profits over the past few years means that we get some pretty good insight into the structures and practices of major companies, and US companies in particular. In the case of Apple, we have had the 2012 US Senate Report, the ongoing EU state-aid case and various other official and unofficial releases.
Back in early 2016 we used the available information for this post to assess Apple’s international structure as it was up to the end of 2014. We will briefly recap that but our main purpose here is to update the narrative to the changes Apple made from the start of 2015.
This chart from the previous post summarises Apple’s original international structure. The detail behind it is explained in that post.
At the top, the parent company Apple Inc., holds the company’s hugely valuable intellectual property including patents, trademarks, brands and trade secrets. Through a cost-sharing agreement an Irish-registered subsidiary, Apple Sales International, was granted the rights to use that intellectual property outside the Americas. This is by far the most important part of the structure.
If the price ASI for that license is close to its economic value (or as the OECD would argue reflective of the value-adding activities of each party) then most of the value will accrue to Apple Inc. and be subject to immediate taxation in the US. However, because of the cost-sharing agreement the price based by ASI is not based on the value of the license but on the amount of research undertaken by Apple Inc. The contributions to the R&D are based on the revenue generated by the markets each party has a license for. It is likely that ASI pays for about 60 per cent of the research undertaken by Apple Inc. This is a large sum running to several billion a year but small relative to the tens of billions of profit that having the license to use Apple’s IP outside the Americas can generate.
ASI was controlled by a US-based board of directors. For the markets it had the license for, ASI contracted with third-party manufacturers in China to make the products and entered sales agreements with Apple-controlled distribution and retail subsidiaries as well as some large customers. ASI collected the huge mark-up between the manufacturing fees and costs and the sales revenue and was left with a huge profit after the cost-sharing payment was made.
It is not clear how the sales of ASI were recorded or reported for balance and payments and national accounts purposes. The company was “stateless” though the entity to which the profit was to be attributed, the head office made up of the board of directors, was based in the US.
To carry-out its underlying activities ASI had a branch in Ireland that undertook the supply, chain, logistics, demand forecasting, administration and other activities involved in getting the products from the manufacturer in Chine to the sales markets. The US board paid a fee to the Irish branch for these activities and the taxable income in Ireland was based on this fee rather than the global profits earned by ASI.
In the initial post we considered what would happen if they global profits were attributed to Ireland. The estimate was that the tax bill could come to €13.85 billion.
This is a bit higher than the €13 billion figure paraded by the European Commission but only because 2013 and 2014 outcomes for ASI were not publicly available at the time. Using the figures from Table 1 of the Commission’s decision which show lower profits for ASI in the final two years than shown above would give the €13 billion figure (even though the Commission itself never publicly verified this and only included references to the €13 billion in press releases rather than the final decision).
Anyway, we know what happened. The Commission have argued that no profit-making substance could be found in the minutes of the meetings of the US-based board of directors of ASI and hence little or no profit could be attributed to the board. The minutes did set out what banks and funds ASI’s billions should be placed with so the interest income ASI earned on its cash pile was attributed to the board of directors.
But what of the billions made in getting products made in China for $200 and selling them around the world for $600? Even though the contracts behind these activities were signed on behalf of ASI by US-based personnel, the minutes of ASI’s board meetings did not record the details of the negotiations and contracts so, in the Commission’s eyes at least, that means that the profits could not be attributed to the ASI board.
So what activities in the company could the profit be attributed to? Well, the only other substance in ASI was the Irish branch so the Commission decision was for “full profit attribution” to the activities of the Irish branch. The Court of Justice of the European Union will get to decide if this is correct.
Anyway, this is raking over old ground. What we are interested in here is what Apple did next. We know Apple changed its structure from the first of January 2015. This is described in section 2.5.7 on page 42 of the Commission’s decision. This would be useful but bar telling us that the new structure came into operation on the first of January 2015 everything else is redacted.
Although the details of the new structure were not revealed it was still felt that Ireland was still central to the structure and maybe even more so with the revised structure. Many of the dramatic shifts that occurred in Ireland’s national accounts and balance of payments data were attributed to Apple but this was largely supposition – even if it was likely to be true.
Now we know it to be true. Back in November, in response to a leak facilitated by the International Consortium of Journalists, Apple issued a statement on its tax affairs. Some extracts:
“The changes Apple made to its corporate structure in 2015 were specially designed to preserve its tax payments to the United States, not to reduce its taxes anywhere else. No operations or investments were moved from Ireland.”“When Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015, we complied by changing the residency of our Irish subsidiaries and we informed Ireland, the European Commission and the United States. The changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country. In fact, our payments to Ireland increased significantly and over the last three years we’ve paid $1.5 billion in tax there — 7 percent of all corporate income taxes paid in that country. Our changes also ensured that our tax obligation to the United States was not reduced.”“When a customer buys an Apple product outside the United States, the profit is first taxed in the country where the sale takes place. Then Apple pays taxes to Ireland, where Apple sales and distribution activity is executed by some of the 6,000 employees working there. Additional tax is then also due in the US when the earnings are repatriated.”“When Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015, Apple made changes to its corporate structure to comply. Since then, all of Apple’s Irish operations have been conducted through Irish resident companies. Apple pays tax at Ireland’s statutory 12.5 percent.”
“When Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015, we complied by changing the residency of our Irish subsidiaries and we informed Ireland, the European Commission and the United States. The changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country. In fact, our payments to Ireland increased significantly and over the last three years we’ve paid $1.5 billion in tax there — 7 percent of all corporate income taxes paid in that country. Our changes also ensured that our tax obligation to the United States was not reduced.”
“When a customer buys an Apple product outside the United States, the profit is first taxed in the country where the sale takes place. Then Apple pays taxes to Ireland, where Apple sales and distribution activity is executed by some of the 6,000 employees working there. Additional tax is then also due in the US when the earnings are repatriated.”
“When Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015, Apple made changes to its corporate structure to comply. Since then, all of Apple’s Irish operations have been conducted through Irish resident companies. Apple pays tax at Ireland’s statutory 12.5 percent.”
There is plenty here that is significant. To start we are told that when Apple sells a product outside the US the “sales and distribution activity is executed” in Ireland. If the sales are executed here (even if they are to another Apple subsidiary) they must be recorded here.
We know the products aren’t manufactured here so they won’t show up in the standard External Trade data. The products are made in China but are done so on behalf of an Irish-resident company. This is a form of “contract manufacturing” and even though the products are never physically in Ireland they are owned by an Irish-resident company and the sales of that company are included in broad measures of Irish exports. Here are Irish goods exports as recorded in the quarterly national accounts.
The level-shift in Q1 2015 is pretty clear with around €15 billion adding to quarterly goods exports. If these were goods made in Ireland we would know a huge amount about them but the additional exports do not appear in the External Trade statistics published by the CSO. This dataset better reflects the goods that physically leave Ireland (though the inclusion of aircraft on an ownership basis means that it is not absolute). Anyway, let’s compare goods exports as measured by the national accounting and external trade methodologies.
As expected almost all of the increase shows up in the gap between the two measures. The gap reflects a number of issues but one of them is “contract manufacturing”. Ireland did not suddenly start producing €15 billion a quarter of extra goods to sell from the start of 2015. What changed was where Apple’s sales were executed and recorded. This was previously with the head office of the non-Irish-resident ASI, but they have been recorded with an Irish-resident entity since the start of 2015. It is possible that this is Apple Distribution International, ADI, which took over many of ASI’s activities in 2012, except the contract manufacturing activity. This may have been added as part of the recent restructure.
The changed structure doesn’t change the profitability of the activity. Here is Table 1 from the Commission’s state aid decision.
For 2014, the final year prior to the restructure, ASI, which organised the contract manufacturing up to then, had revenue of around $68 billion and this led to a profit of around $25 billion. We can expect the outturns for the company which carried out this activity in 2015 to be similar.
And maybe we can see evidence of that in the national accounts’ aggregates published by the CSO and, in particular, the changes introduced between the preliminary estimates published with the Q4 2015 Quarterly National Accounts in March 2016 and the first annual estimates published a few months later with the 2015 National Income and Expenditure Accounts.
There can be lots of reasons for revisions to national accounts and it is likely that profits across a number of sectors were increased as more detail behind the 2015 surge in Corporation Tax receipts became known to the CSO. It is also the case that the differences shown are net outcomes between unseen amounts of various upwards and downwards changes. However, there is little doubt that one of the key additions for the 2015 NIE was the inclusion of Apple’s contract manufacturing activity for the first time and the recording of Apple’s product sales in the Irish accounts.
Looking at the changes to the expenditure components of national income.
* Investment was revised up by €6.8 billion. In national accounting R&D spending is considered investment (prior to ESA2010 it was intermediate consumption). The increase in investment in the NIE likely reflects inclusion of the cost-sharing payment for the R&D activity undertaken by Apple Inc. We know that ASI paid around $4.5 billion under the cost-sharing agreement in 2014 (see table six of the state aid decision) which was around 60 per cent of Apple’s overall R&D expense for the year. In 2015, Apple’s R&D expense increased by 25 per cent which would put the likely cost-sharing payment from the contract manufacturer in the realm of the increase to investment shown in the table above., * Exports were revised up by €56.6 billion. In 2014, ASI had sales revenue of around $68 billion which in 2015 would give a ballpark for the sales now executed and recorded in Ireland., * Imports were revised up by €20.2 billion. We don’t have a cost of sales figure to use but this would represent the manufacturing fee paid to the third-party manufacturer in China as well as the purchase of components from around the world for assembly in China. Although these goods could be shipped from other European countries to China they are counted as an Irish goods import as they are purchased by an Irish-resident company as part of a contract manufacturing arrangement. The assembler in China does not take ownership of the components.,
Putting these expenditure items together leads to the upward revision in GDP. This was €41.2 billion which is a good deal more than the profits of ASI in 2014 which we are using as an indicative guide to the impact of the Apple restructure in 2015. As stated this likely reflects increased profits across a range of companies but something like $25 billion due to Apple cannot be discounted.
We would assume that most of these profits added in the NIE release would be the result of foreign-owned MNCs but we see that the net outflow of factor income was “only” revised up by €19.6 billion. This means that €21.6 billion of the additional income was counted as accruing to Irish residents.
We know Apple is foreign-owned so maybe the €19.6 billion represents the profits from Apple’s contract manufacturing being attributed back to Apple Inc. in the US. That would give a nice symmetry and completeness to the 2014 outturns for ASI and the changes introduced with the 2015 NIE for Ireland.
But as we’ll see our focus should be on the additional €21.6 billion attributed to the GNP of Irish residents rather than the €19.6 billion attributed to non-residents through increased net factor outflows.
To see this, we now turn our attention to the taxation of these profits. If the relocation of Apple’s contract manufacturing activities to Ireland led to an additional €19.6 billion of profits being attributed to non-residents it must be remembered that this is net profit, i.e. after taxation.
If €19.6 billion is after-tax profit, it implies that around €2.5 billion of Corporation Tax was paid. Now this actually could be in line with the large jump seen in Irish Corporation Tax receipts in 2015. So, did Apple pay a couple of billion of extra Corporation Tax in 2015? No. How do we know? The company told us.
In their recent statement Apple said in relation to Ireland that “over the last three years we’ve paid $1.5 billion in tax there”. So that is around $0.5 billion a year. A lot, yes, but not the scale we’re looking for.
Back when the state aid decision was announced, Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer said:
“In 2014, Apple paid in Ireland, to the Irish tax authorities, $400 million. $400 million in 2014. We believe, we're not certain, but we believe it's the largest tax payment that any company has made in Ireland.”
From Table 1 of the state aid decision shown above we can see that this did not arise from the contract manufacturing activities undertaken by ASI in 2014 which declared a tax charge of less than $10 million. It is likely that the $400 million referenced by Maestri refers to other Apple activities in Ireland.
So, did Apple’s Corporation Tax payments in Ireland increase significantly after the 2015 restructure? No, it appears not. The payments do seem to have increased a bit but not significantly from what three times the $400 million payment for 2014 imply. This points to Apple not being a significant factor in the 2015 surge in Corporation Tax receipts. So, why didn’t the Apple restructure and the relocation of its hugely profitable contract manufacturing activities to Ireland lead to a jump in its Corporation Tax payments in Ireland?
May we should shift our attention away from the €19.6 billion increase in net factor outflows that the CSO included with the 2015 NIE and look instead at the €21.6 billion that was added to the estimate of Gross National Product. But why would tens of billions of profit from what is clearly a foreign-owned company be included in the GNP of Irish residents?
It is possible that the two questions that conclude the previous two paragraphs are related. To explore this, we turn to data from the Revenue Commissioners and, in particular, the aggregate Corporation Tax calculation for 2014 and 2015.
We don’t have any revisions to help us here. Gross Trade Profits rose by €50.7 billion in 2015 but total amounts deducted increased by €40.0 billion so the increase in Net Trading Income was €10.7 billion.
Of the deductions, the most notable increase is the €27.5 billion increase in Trade Capital Allowances. Capital allowances are the tax equivalent of depreciation. When a company buys a capital item the expenditure on that item can be offset against profit and capital allowances spread that expenditure to be offset against gross trade profits over a number of years.
When the ICIJ reported on the latest data leak last November there was speculation that Apple was using capital allowances to offset the gross trading profits of its contract manufacturing activities which had relocated to Ireland in 2015.
The statement did not respond to speculation in this and other media outlets involved with the Paradise Papers project, that Apple has used Ireland’s capital allowances regime to avoid having to pay tax on massive profits being booked through Ireland.
But if Apple had over €20 billion of additional profits in Ireland in 2015 with no noticeable increase in its tax payments then some offset mechanism was used to reduce the €2.5 billion of Corporation Tax payments that would typically ensue such profits.
In the “double irish” structure used by other companies such a reduction is achieved by outbound royalty payments. Some of these are shown as Trade Charges in the above table from the Revenue Commissioners but this excludes some which as classed as an administration fee and deducted “above the line” for the above table. The broadest coverage of these is in the royalties/license payments item in the Balance of Payments.
These did increase recently but almost all of that happened before 2015 and there is no level shift evident from the time of the Apple restructure in Q1 2015. Apple did not move to a “double irish” type structure with the 2015 restructure.
So that brings us back to the €27.5 billion increase in capital allowances in the Revenue statistics. The Revenue data is annual but it would be better to try and identify this increase in depreciation in quarterly data. Here is the consumption of fixed capital (the national accounting treatment of depreciation) for the non-financial corporate sector in the Institutional Sector Accounts.
We have a winner. There can be no doubting the level-shift that occurred in Q1 2015 with the depreciation of the non-financial corporate sector rising by over €6 billion at staying at the new elevated level.
Such a rise in depreciation can only occur if there is a significant increase in the stock of assets. If Apple is responsible then it would be the case that the license to use Apple’s intellectual property outside the US was relocated to Ireland. And, in order, for capital allowances to be claimed capital expenditure must be incurred.
Unfortunately, we don’t see direct evidence of such expenditure as it seems the company undertook the expenditure before becoming Irish resident, i.e., there was a balance-sheet relocation. But we can look for impact of the newly-Irish-resident companies on aggregate balance sheet data. If a company is going to acquire the license to Apple’s IP it may have had to borrow the money to fund the acquisition.
Whoa! There’s that Q1 2015 level-shift again but this time it is of the order of €250 billion. What was this debt used for? To buy assets it seems. And the chart also suggests that this debt is being repaid at a fairly healthy clip. The national accounts data indicate that the money is not leaving Ireland in the form of an income flow and here we can see that it is likely leaving the country in the form of a debt repayment.
Ireland capital stock jumped by €300 billion in 2015 which was a 40 per cent increase in just one year. This was not new infrastructure (buildings, roads etc.) though data suppression by the CSO means we are left with a residual to be explained by transport equipment (including aircraft for leasing) and R&D assets. Figures for these two parts of the capital stock have not been provided since 2015 though their sum shows they were responsible for the jump in the capital stock.
Between them the stock of transport equipment and R&D assets increased by €260 billion in 2015. This increase does not show up in the capital formation data for that year for these were added to Ireland’s capital stock through balance-sheet relocations.
A typical second-hand wide-body aircraft might have a value of, say, €30 million. A thousand such aircraft would have a value of €30 billion. We cannot be certain but there is unlikely to have been 1,000 wide-body aircraft re-located to Ireland in 2015. Even if there was we are still left with an unexplained increase of €230 billion in Ireland’s capital stock. By process of elimination this is due to the relocation of intangible assets to Ireland, a large part of which is likely the relocation of the license for Apple’s IP outside the US to Ireland.
So this points to the use of capital allowances that have enabled Apple to keep their tax payments steady while relocating their contract manufacturing activity to Ireland with the subsequent execution and recording of their ex-US product sales in Ireland. But the company themselves haven’t said this is what they are doing. Or have they?
Consider this from the company’s 10-Q SEC filing from February 2017:
Income Taxes
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective adoption method. Currently, the Company anticipates recording up to $9 billion of net deferred tax assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these deferred tax assets are utilized.
This relates to deferred tax assets linked to the internal transfer of non-inventory assets. Capital allowances are a form of deferred tax asset and the transfer/sale of a license from one subsidiary to another would be an intra-entity transfer covered by the new standards. Maybe Apple has loads of licenses to be transferring around but the rights to use the company’s intellectual property outside the US is as big as it gets.
Apple states that the income tax consequences of such transfers when it begins to recognise them in the first quarter of 2019 as a result of accounting standards changes that become effective at that time will be $9 billion. If this relates to the use of capital allowances in Ireland then we are looking at a minimum of $72 billion of capital allowances ($72 billion x 12.5% = $9 billion) being available at that time – and that is after tens of billions have been claimed each year since 2015.
We can see that impact these capital allowances have had on the company’s tax bill by looking at another dataset produced by the Revenue Commissioners. This is the aggregate tax calculation for companies with nil or negative net trading income. We previously looked at that in detail here.
We are primarily interested in the change from 2014 to 2015. For 2015, we see that companies with no net trading income had €40 billion of gross trading profits, an increase of €26.5 billion and a near trebling of the 2014 level. If Apple are responsible for a large part of the increases in capital allowances and depreciation we saw above then the capital allowances figure here is very revealing. For 2015, the amount of capital allowances available increased by €25.6 billion which one its own was almost enough to fully offset the increase in gross trading profits.
Net trading income feeds in taxable income on which Corporation Tax is levied. How much tax is due on net trading income amount of nil? Nil. The reason Apple’s tax bill didn’t increase in 2015 is because they were able to fully offset the gross profit from the contract manufacturing activity relocated to Ireland with capital allowances.
If should also be noted that such an outcome would not have been possible prior to 2015. Up to that time there was a cap on the amount capital allowances that could be used in a single year. This cap was set at 80 per cent of the income eligible to be offset by the capital allowances. So, if a company had, say, a profit of 20 and 25 of capital allowances available for that year the most that could be used in that year is 16 (80 per cent of 20) with the unused capital allowances carried forward to later years. For 2015 this cap was raised to 100 per cent so that all income could be offset provided sufficient capital allowances were available. See this note for a discussion.
Although it appears that Apple was able to fully offset the profit from the “contract manufacturing” activity in 2015 this may not be the case in future years if the level of profit rises above the annual amount of capital allowances available and, over a long enough period, continued profits will result in the capital allowances being fully exhausted at some stage with no further amounts available to deduct.
In their recent statement Apple said “[t]he changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country.” This is true for Ireland. Prior to 2015, Apple did not pay tax to Ireland for the contract manufacturing as it was not located here. When this activity was moved here in 2015 the amount of tax paid was also close to nil as the capital allowances wiped out the gross profits.
From an Irish perspective there isn’t anything hugely egregious about this. The Irish operations of US MNCs use technology and intellectual property that was almost exclusively developed in the US. That the Irish subsidiaries have to pay for the use of that technology is pretty standard.
In many cases this is achieved through royalty payments with the Irish company “renting” the license to use the technology. The expenditure on these outbound royalty payments reduce the taxable income in Ireland as they are incurred.
In more recent times we have seen Irish subsidiaries “buying” the license outright via IP onshoring. This once-off capital expenditure is also allowable as an offset to reduce a company’s taxable income with rules setting out how much can be claimed each year until the full amount is used.
Of course, in both cases these are payments for technology developed in the US so the payments should go to the US to reflect the value-adding activities that are carried out there. That the US allows companies to “offshore” their technology licenses for a cost-sharing payment based on the amount of research expenditure incurred rather than the amount of profit earned is a matter for the US.
But the European Commission has decided that what happens in Ireland is a matter for it. Back in November, Commissioner Vestager indicated she had some interest in what Apple did next:
“I have been asking for an update on the arrangement made by Apple, the recent way they have been organized, in order to get the feeling whether or not this is in accordance with our European rules but that remains to be seen”“We are looking into this of course without any kind of prejudice, just to get the information.”
“We are looking into this of course without any kind of prejudice, just to get the information.”
Page 42 of the state aid decision suggests that the Commission have all the information they need. Through an Irish lens the new arrangement does not pose concerns, from a tax perspective at any rate. An Irish company is exploiting technology developed elsewhere and has incurred capital expenditure buying a license for the right to use that IP - how much would you pay for the ex-US rights to Apple’s IP?
The company didn’t pay much tax to Ireland on this activity in 2014 (because it happened somewhere else) and everything points to them not paying much tax to Ireland on it in 2015 (because the company in Ireland had to pay for the right to do it).
But what about through the lens of the European Commission? And in particular this subsection from the section of the Irish Taxes Consolidation Act (section 291A) that sets out how capital allowances for the acquisition of intangible assets can be claimed:
(7) This section shall not apply to capital expenditure incurred by a company—
(a) for which any relief or deduction under the Tax Acts may be given or allowed other than by virtue of this section,
(b) to the extent that the expenditure incurred on the provision of a specified intangible asset exceeds the amount which would have been paid or payable for the asset in a transaction between independent persons acting at arm’s length, or
(c) that is not made wholly and exclusively for bona fide commercial reasons and that was incurred as part of a scheme or arrangement of which the main purpose or one of the main purposes is the avoidance of, or reduction in, liability to tax.
OK, while paragraph (a) means that a deduction of the capital expenditure incurred can only be taken once and paragraph (b) means that the amount to be deducted cannot exceed the arm’s length value, our interest is in paragraph (c): a claim for capital allowances for expenditure on intangible assets cannot be made as part of a tax avoidance scheme or to reduce a company’s tax liability. Let’s repeat some sentences from Apple’s recent statement:
“The changes Apple made to its corporate structure in 2015 were specially designed to preserve its tax payments to the United States, not to reduce its taxes anywhere else.”“The changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country.”“There was no tax benefit for Apple from this change and, importantly, this did not reduce Apple’s tax payments or tax liability in any country.”
“The changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country.”
“There was no tax benefit for Apple from this change and, importantly, this did not reduce Apple’s tax payments or tax liability in any country.”
And, yes, the company did put the second of these extracts in bold. There are keen to state that the structure did not reduce their tax liability. The final extract is actually in reference to Apple’s decision to redomicile the company that holds (or at least held) its overseas cash to Jersey. That is pretty much a non-issue. US companies must pay US corporate income tax on passive income they earn from third parties (such as interest) in the period in which it is earned.
If Apple had made that company Irish resident they would have had to pay our 25 per cent Corporation Tax rate for non-trading income and then pay an additional ten per cent to reach the then US rate of 35 per cent. By domiciling in Jersey no tax is due in that jurisdiction but the full 35 per cent would have been due to the US in any event. The Jersey element of this is a non-story.
But back to what might become a story. How might the European Commission view Apple’s decision to shift the “contract manufacturing” activity to Ireland in 2015? If viewed through their lens could it be construed as tax avoidance? Absolutely.
The logic of the state-aid decision is that, up to 2014, Apple owes tax on the profits from its “contract manufacturing” activity to Ireland because the only substance the Commission could see that was able to generate those profits was in Ireland. The Commission could not see evidence that the US-based board of directors was responsible for the profits so all the profits were attributed to the activities in Ireland. Of the €13 billion figure suggested by the Commission around €2.5 billion will be due to profits earned in 2014.
In 2015, Apple carried out much the same functions in Ireland but now the sales were executed and recorded in Ireland and the license for the IP was onshored to Ireland. From the perspective of the Commission the tax liability on the profits went from €2.5 billion to nil. Is that reducing a tax liability?
Maybe 291a(7)(c) would be satisfied if the company that received the money for selling the IP license had paid capital gains tax. But that didn’t happen. And maybe you could argue that from an Irish perspective it is up to the jurisdiction where the IP originated to ensure that the appropriate CGT is charged.
But the IP left the US when the cost-sharing agreement was put in place way back in 1980 and right up to 2015 it was held by a stateless company and located nowhere. The CGT rate in nowhere is zero. And the Irish branches had the use of the IP up to 2014.
If the Commission’s €13 billion decision is upheld by the courts then Apple will owe €2.5 billion of Corporation Tax for the €20 billion of profit earned by ASI in 2014. In 2015, much the same profit was earned by a related company in Ireland which carried out much the same activity except it has paid a couple of hundred billion to buy the license for the IP underlying the activity.
Again, from an Irish perspective this isn’t a huge issue. The profit linked to the IP wasn’t here in 2014 so wasn’t taxed here. The IP was onshored in 2015, which resulted in the profit being located here as the GDP changes illustrate. The profit was generated by an asset now located here so the profit offset by the depreciation of that asset was included in Ireland’s GNP. The company earning that profit had bought a license giving it the right to use that IP and such a payment would typically be deductible for tax purposes. The appropriate Irish law was followed appropriately.
But if you are the European Commission and your view is that €2.5 billion of tax is due to Ireland for 2014 then what else could you say but that the use of capital allowances in 2015 against the same profit (albeit in a different company) had as one its main purposes the reduction in liability to tax. Through the Commission’s lens such a claim for capital allowances would not be allowed per S291a(7)(c) though as well as showing that there was a reduction in the tax liability they would also have to show that it was not a bona fide commercial transaction so it is far from clear that such a view would hold up under legal scrutiny.
This means that what is at stake when the original state-aid decision is finally decided by the courts may not just be the €13 billion plus interest for the period from 2004 to 2014 but possibly also €2.5 billion to €3 billion for every year since. There would be no basis to challenge the use of capital allowances in the 2015 restructure if the €13 billion ruling isn’t upheld.
One question that arises is why didn’t Apple move to a “double irish” arrangement in 2015. They could have done so. The company had to change its original structure in response to the restrictions on “stateless” companies that was due to come into effect at the start of 2015 but the provisions against “double irish” structures in non-treaty partner countries that came in at the same time were grandfathered for existing companies until the end of 2020, and it may also have been possible to find a treaty partner country in which such an arrangement could achieve similar tax outcomes. Possibilities along this line were provided here.
As Irish-registered companies before the grandfathering cut-off Apple could have availed of the provisions to allow the company holding the IP to become resident in a no-tax jurisdiction until the end of 2020. When the residency rules first began to change we thought that is what the company would do (see last paragraph).
Apple could have had an Irish operating company exploit their IP and executing the sales but get the money out of Ireland via a royalty payment to the IP holding company. The restructure needed to be put in place from the start of 2015 and the grandfathering would have given a six-year timeframe for a structure using, say, Bermuda.
Now, maybe the company didn’t want to go down the line of using a pure tax haven and they may also have believed there was a risk that the European Commission would examine “double irish” type structures as part of the ongoing state aid investigations. This is precisely what the Commission have done in the Amazon-Luxembourg case – see discussion here – and it is possible that similar two-company arrangements in Ireland will be put under the microscope in due course. But it equally must have been the case, back in 2014 at any rate, that Apple’s expectation of a “full profit attribution” outcome to their state aid case must have been low.
Anyway, we are where we are. Apple onshored their IP to Ireland in 2015 and the consequences for the company and the country can be traced though various figures and statistics as we have done here. Since the restructure was put in place we have had the Commission’s announcement in August 2016 of their conclusions in the state aid case and the rapid progression of changes to the US tax code through Congress in late 2017. There are also a number of mooted changes to Irish Corporation Tax possibly coming down the tracks. It is highly likely we will have another Apple restructure to pick through in due course but until then what is at stake in the state aid court case will potentially be getting larger and larger."ÿÿWhat Apple did next

A group of global activists stormed and occupied several Apple Inc. Stores in France on Saturday in a move aimed at pressuring the company to pay up on a €13 billion ($15.5 billion) tax bill to the European Union.
In a press release, the France unit of the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and Citizen's Action organization (Attac), said 100 of its members occupied the Opera Apple Store in Paris, demanding the company pay its taxes. Attac bills itself as an international movement that fights for financial market regulation and the closing of tax havens, among other goals.
Attac said dozens of protests were organized at other Apple AAPL, +0.16% store locations throughout France on Saturday. In the Paris store, where activists were seen via videos circulating on Twitter, pushing past security and hanging a banner that said “We will stop when Apple pays.”

Attac claims that Apple’s “tax optimization methods have allowed it to accumulate more than $230 billion in tax havens,” accusing the company of using its Irish subsidiaries to relocate a chunk of those global profits and pay nearly no taxes.
Opinion: How does Apple’s money get from California to Bermuda anyway?
“Apple must stop denying the tax practices highlighted by the European Commission’s investigation, withdraw its appeal to the European Court of Justice and pay its fine of 13 billion euros as quickly as possible,” said Aurélie Trouvé, spokesman for Attac, according to the release. Trouvé added that to verify that Apple is paying correct taxes, the company must “publish its country-by-country reporting now and retroactively over the past few years. “
The European Commission has been in the process of investigating tax arrangements with multinationals across the region. It has referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to collect around €13 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple, citing illegal tax benefits. Both Apple and Ireland are appealing that decision.

The Paris occupation ended after three hours, but not before activists left protest messages across the screens of devices such as the store’s iPads. Attac said the action was part of the #PhoneRevolt movement aimed at highlighting unfair practices by Apple, that are not just about taxes, but also pollution via extraction of metals for its phones, worker exploitation and driving a global consumption binge.

Submission for the Green my Apple campaign by Phil.
We launched our campaign to reduce electronic waste in 2004, with the aim to remove the worst toxic substances from electronic products, improve recycling policies, and to catalyze a fundamental change in the way our electronic gadgets are designed, produced, and recycled.
In 2006, we published a ranking guide to put pressure on individual companies to improve policies and practices.
Companies like Dell and Lenovo responded to the pressure, commiting to phase outs of the worst toxic substances from their product ranges, and in the case of Dell, challenging the entire computer industry to adopt a worldwide free take-back policy, as Dell had done.
In late 2006, it became clear that the company which had been least responsive and falling further and further back in the rankings was, surprisingly, Apple.
Apple fans
In considering how we might win improved policies from Apple, we knew one thing for certain: Apple might tune out Greenpeace, but they would never tune out their customers. Apple's famously loyal fan base was the one force on the planet that was guaranteed to get the attention of Apple CEO Steve Jobs.
So we decided this was to be a very different Greenpeace campaign, one in which we would turn over the reigns to Apple's customers. We would stand in the shoes of Apple fans, we would speak as fellow believers in the wizards of Cupertino, and we'd try to channel waves of Apple Love at corporate headquarters.
The result was the launch of the 'Green my Apple' website in September 2006, the first words of which were, ""We love Apple.""
The site was designed to look like Apple's own site, with in-jokes that only Apple fans would get, and a single unifying theme:
""We love our Macs. We just wish they came in green.""
It was designed, written and promoted as a place where Apple fans interested in a greener Apple could learn about the call for Apple to be a green leader and, crucially, show their support in many different ways.
If you only had a minute you could email Steve (Just ""Steve."" Apple fansare all on a first name basis with Apple's CEO) and you could recommend the 'Green my Apple' site to social networking services like Digg, Hugg, and del.icio.us with a single click.
If you had more time, you could blog about the campaign, and your blog entry, whether positive or negative, would become part of the content of the site itself due to the magic of Technorati and RSS feeds.
And for those with creative talent there were ""ProCreation"" challenges for people to create poster and t-shirt designs.
In the begining
This is virtuoso activism - with the best usage of online and digital mediaI have ever seen. From a digital communications perspective, I think that Greenpeace have really upped the ante with this one.
Rather than responding to Greenpeace, Apple should respond directly to their users and fans. The message could be about how they realise this issue is important to their stakeholders, which is why they are reacting. Apple can then clarify their green strategy and future plans to improvement.- International Association of Business Communicators Blog, 3 November 2006
At the start of the 'Green my Apple' campaign, we made it clear what we wanted:
We want you to run this campaign. We want you to create the campaign T-shirt, pen the speech in which Steve Jobs announces the Greening of Apple, shoot the Apple Ad that sets Cupertino talking about clean production and take-back schemes.
The Green my Apple website has all the information and the raw materials you need to get you started. If you're creative, create. If you're networked, network. There's plenty to do, and many hands make light work.
In a first for Greenpeace, we gave away some of our images and videos under creative commons licenses for people to remix and mash up and post on the sites 'ProCreations' page. What came back was high quality, amusing and wonderful work.
Bloggers made and shared their own blog buttons quicker than we could respond to a request for them. Some people made online merchandise to promote the campaign before we'd even thought of it.
Take off
In fact from the day of the launch, interest in the site was massive (the resilience of our servers had never been so thoroughly tested!) and soon the ProCreations were flowing in. Apple chose not to comment. perhaps hoping their fans would come to their defence.
But the difference this time was that Apple wasn't being attacked, Apple fans were asking their favourite company to be greener. In fact we were getting so many designs in the first few weeks we had to make the process to put them up much faster.
Not content to remain online we took the green my apple message to MacExpo in London to talk to Mac fans in person.
The majority of people we talked to were supportive of a greener Apple.
Unfortunately the MacExpo organisers and Apple were not so keen on a greener Apple message and closed our stall at the venue.
Online many Mac users were writing and blogging about the campaign from magazine writers to marketing and advertising executives. even Mac media encouraged people to support a greener Apple:
It's a campaign we should all support, as it will only make for an even better Apple.- Nik Rawlinson, Editor MacUser UK.
If Steve Jobs gets up there and talks about reducing toxic chemicals in their products, people will applaud him for it. Make us proud, Steve.- Macuser.com
In-store appearances
The green my apple team also visited Apple stores in London, Amsterdam, Austin (Texas), and New York to spread the 'Green my Apple' work and have a bit of fun by sending a message to Steve direct from the Apple store.
Default wallpapers and homepages on showroom computers were subverted with 'Green my Apple' messages. People were making their own videos for the campaign and even creating and selling their own 'Green my Apple' t-shirts online.
But we still needed an easy way for Apple fans to do more to show their support. So in November we launched the hug your Mac action, in which Mac users could download a desktop picture and declare their love of their Mac, and their wish that it came in green.
Soon all sorts of images of green Mac love were being posted on the popular photo-sharing site, Flickr. On the global map a spread of pictures appeared with photos spanning the globe from the Domincan Republic to London, Dubai to New York, Paris to Hong Kong.
The next big Apple event was Macworld in San Francisco. We created an alternative keynote speech (using Quicktime) in which Steve announced the phase out of dangerous chemicals, a worldwide take-back policy, and a green iPod.
Spoof Steve
It was an instant hit on YouTube and by the day of Steve's real keynote speech, the spoof video had been viewed over 100,000 times.
In February we heard the first gossip that Steve was considering a response, and that he might be thinking of sending a little green love back, appropriately enough on Valentine's Day. Despite the fact that more designs and hug pictures were appearing online, Apple continued to publicly deny it planned any changes.
We knew that Apple usually makes policy announcements just before its annual general meeting in May. Our US office organised student campus groups to hold 'Green my Apple' days on campus which resulted in over 1000 green Apple photo messages for Steve.
Students from three continents contacted us about running 'Green my Apple' projects. Meanwhile there were increasing questions about how Apple would respond to two shareholder resolutions calling for Apple to phase out toxic chemicals and improve its recycling policy.
Despite the arguments, let's hope Apple can come to terms with stronger and more effective policies in this delicate day and age of increasing environmental concerns.- The Unofficial Apple Weblog
Awards
The great work being posted on the website, which had already generated many blog comments, started to get more formal recognition. The sitewas nominated for best non-profit site at the SXSW web awards.
It then won a Webby award as best activist site of the year.
Before we'd finished the champagne, though, that same week we saw something we'd really been waiting for:
A familiar-looking green apple appeared on the Apple website with avery familiar heading ""A Greener Apple,"" linking to an open letter from Steve Jobs declaring a change in policy.
While it was not everything that we had hoped for from Apple, it was good news.
Steve stepped up to be clearer about Apple's environmental policies. He declared a phase out of the worst chemicals in its product range, Brominated Fire Retardants (BFRs) and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) by 2008. He promised more transparency.
While falling short of announcing a global take back policy, Apple did pledge to increase its recycling rate in the future.
But apart from the details, it was clear that Steve had got the green Apple message loud and clear:
""Apple is already a leader in innovation and engineering, and we are applying these same talents to become an environmental leader.""
Given Steve's reputation for secrecy and single mindedness it's a massive achievement to see him echoing what so many people called for - Apple as a green leader.
But that statement is just the first step being a green leader - to help ensure Steve doesn't forget who asked him for a green Apple we've made him a nice reminder (just in case he hasn't had time to check all the ProCreations!) Using Apple software we created and delivered this book of the best of 'Green my Apple' direct to Steve. View the book:
This how we delivered it direct to Steve with the help of Apple of course!
The next challenge
Clearly Steve got the message, so we have archived our 'Green my Apple' website and issued a challenge to all the major computer makers to see who will be the first to match their promises by putting a less toxic computer on the market.
We'll continue to monitor company commitments and actions on our Greener Electronics Guide every 3 months to ensure phase out schedules and actions are kept. But we're also confident that Apple will keep its promise -- because it made that promise not to Greenpeace, but to its customers.
Hopefully Steve will make a start by announcing green features of the iPhone when it is launched soon?
Harnessing the power of customers
This campaign was a lesson in people power. It's not every daythat the CEO of a Fortune 500 company responds to a campaign demand on the front page of his website.
Yet over the past few years,we've found that campaigns which harness the power of customers are becoming increasingly effective in moving corporate policy toward better green policies.
Online activism has turned Coca-Cola from a climate-killer to an innovator in refrigeration technologies. McDonald's went from a destroyer of the rainforest to the champion of a moratorium on new soy plantations in the Amazon.
Asnew web tools enable more creative online activism, more socialnetworking, more global campaigns, and more collaboration fromaudiences made up of customers and consumers, the global onlinecommunity is becoming an increasingly powerful force for change.
We'reall a part of the ""Second Superpower"" of public opinion, and the Greenmy Apple campaign is but one example of how solutions to planetaryproblems can be won. All it takes, sometimes, is people speaking up.

SHANGHAI — A Chinese environmental group has singled out Apple for criticism, accusing the company’s Chinese suppliers of discharging polluted waste and toxic metals into surrounding communities and threatening public health.
The group, the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, released a 46-page report Wednesday documenting what it said was pollution from the dozens of “suspected” Apple suppliers throughout China.
The report, which the group said was based on visits to many of the factories’ regions, said that factories that the group suspected were Apple suppliers often “fail to properly dispose of hazardous waste” and that 27 of the suppliers had been found to have environmental problems.
An Apple spokesman said Wednesday that the company had been aggressively monitoring factories in its supply chain with regular audits.
“Apple is committed to driving the highest standards of social responsibility throughout our supply chain,” said Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif.

He added: “We require that our supplier provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever Apple products are made.”
Apple’s products have grown hugely popular in China, which already has the world’s busiest Apple stores. But the company has also been dogged by challenges here, though Apple does not typically disclose its list of suppliers.
Last year, one of Apple’s biggest suppliers was hit by a wave of worker suicides at several of its mainland Chinese facilities. And in May, an explosion and fire at a plant that made Apple products killed two people and injured more than a dozen in the city of Chengdu, in southwest China.
Also earlier this year, Apple acknowledged that 137 workers at a Chinese factory near the city of Suzhou had been seriously injured by a toxic chemical used in making the signature slick glass screens of the iPhone.
But Apple is hardly the only company facing criticism over its Chinese supply chain. In recent years, dozens of multinationals have been accused of using Chinese factories that employed child labor, violated the country’s labor laws and fouled its waterways.
Supply chain experts say brand-name companies generally do a better job of monitoring and auditing their suppliers than smaller companies in China.
But most experts agree that while conditions have improved at many work sites, labor violations and the discharge of toxic waste remain major problems.
Apple said it carried out its own regular audits of supplier factories. It issues a report each year detailing problems it faced and explaining its monitoring practices and how it induces suppliers to correct violations within 90 days.
In many cases, Apple says that its audits are the first conducted by any company on the facilities, and that many of those involve environmental audits.
But Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, said Thursday that Apple had a poor environmental record and that the company had been less responsive to the group’s investigations than other electronics makers.
(Mr. Ma did say, however, that Apple had agreed to discuss the latest report.)
A similar report on Apple was issued by his group last January.
“Apple has made this commitment that it’s a green company,” Mr. Ma said by telephone Thursday. “So how do you fulfill your commitment if you don’t consider you have responsibility in your suppliers’ pollution?”"ÿÿGroup Criticizes Apple’s Environmental Record in China

Apple is more secretive about its supply chain in China than almost all of its rivals, according to a new report by anti-pollution activists who accuse the company's products of degrading the environment and poisoning workers.
Despite its claim to be a leading promoter of corporate ethics worldwide, the maker of iPads and iPhones came joint bottom among 29 major IT firms in a transparency study drawn up by a coalition of China's leading environmental groups.
""Behind their stylish image, Apple products have a side many do not know about – pollution and poison. This side is hidden deep within the company's secretive supply chain,"" claims a statement by the 36 groups involved in the Green Choice Initiative.
Their report – the fourth to look at the impact of global brands on China's environment – considers the openness of IT firms and their responsiveness to reports of environmental violations at suppliers.
It follows a series of workplace poisonings, heavy metal contamination incidents and suicides at Chinese factories that supply materials and components for mobile phones and computers.
Many leading brands outsource production to little-known Chinese firms, where labour costs can be lower, safety standards weaker and environmental regulations more lax than in the west.
Foreign companies say they promote global levels of corporate social responsibility. Apple's supplier code of conduct claims to draw upon ""internationally recognised standards to advance social and environmental responsibility"".
But it is difficult for third parties to hold foreign firms to account because they tend to be secretive about their suppliers, citing corporate confidentiality. This lack of transparency, combined with official corruption and dire political accountability, has made China a haven for polluters.
In recent years, more than 3,000 children have been diagnosed with unsafe levels of lead in their blood in a series of heavy-metal contamination outbreaks near smelting plants. Many of the facilities provided materials used in the batteries and casings for foreign IT firms.
None of the 29 firms in the survey obliged their suppliers to disclose details of waste discharges, though there were big differences in their responses to public inquiries and reported environmental problems. Apple was ranked – alongside other major consumer electronics firms – as the least willing to provide data or to answer questions about suppliers.
The authors say Apple's suppliers have been involved in breaches of environmental regulations. The report noted waste discharge violations in recent years at several Chinese firms that are thought to be part of Apple's supply chain.
Labour conditions were also called into question when at least a dozen workers jumped to their deaths last spring at the Foxconn electronics complex in Shenzhen, which makes parts for Apple and other foreign companies.
Critics say foreign firms are largely responsible for pollution because they insist on low prices, which puts pressure on suppliers to cut costs and corners. This is disputed by the companies.
Apple's reticence was heavily criticised last May, when at least 62 workers fell sick after inhaling n-hexane used to clean touch screens at a Wintek electronics factory in Suzhou. The managers at the Taiwan-owned plant reportedly switched to the noxious chemical – which can cause nerve damage for up to two years – apparently because it dried more quickly than alcohol, thus increasing efficiency.
Hospitalised victims, cited in the new Green Choice video, said they made products for Apple and have written to the company's chief executive, Steve Jobs, requesting an explanation.
""We want to ask you whether or not you should be responsible for the supplier companies you have chosen?"" they ask in the letter. ""When you look down at the Apple phone you are using in your hand and you swipe it with your finger is it possible that you can feel as if it is no longer a beautiful screen to show off, but the life and the blood of us employees and victims? Did you supervise the auditing staff to ensure that they were responsible and diligent?""
Nokia and Motorola responded to questions about their involvement with Wintek soon after the poisoning was revealed. Apple has yet to confirm or deny a relationship. The company said it would not comment on individual allegations.
The report's authors say they tried for months to raise Wintek with Apple, but it refused to comment directly.
""This attitude means it is impossible to have any public supervision over their supply chain. Without that how can we trust them?"" said Ma Jun of the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs. ""When environmental violations become public knowledge, they should not use commercial confidentiality as an excuse for silence. This is different from other leading brands.""
Hewlett Packard, British Telecom, Samsung, Sony, Siemens and Alcatel were credited as being the most responsive to third-party inquiries about alleged environmental violations.
""Apple can say it is completely 'green' because it is a brand with no factory, but if it doesn't manage its supply chain, these are just empty words,"" said Ma Jun of the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs. ""Far from being the best on planet, it is bottom among 29 IT brands. Apple should be a leader. If it can move on this, it can change the whole industry."""ÿÿApple secretive about 'polluting and poisoning' supply chain, says report

Apple has pulled its products off the U.S. government-backed registration of environmentally friendly electronics.
Apple asked EPEAT, the electronics standards setting group, to pull its 39 certified desktop computers, monitors and laptops, which included past versions of the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, off the list of green products late last month, Robert Frisbee, CEO of EPEAT told CIO Journal. EPEAT, created through funding by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and manufacturers, awards products a seal to certify they are recyclable and designed to maximize energy efficiency and minimize environmental harm.
In order to meet the standards, recyclers need to be able to easily disassemble products, with common tools, to separate toxic components, like batteries. The standards were created jointly by manufacturers, including Apple, advocacy groups and government agencies. Frisbee says an Apple staff member told him at the end of June that the company no longer wanted Apple computers to be listed as EPEAT certified.
“They said their design direction was no longer consistent with the EPEAT requirements,” Frisbee said. The company did not elaborate, Frisbee said. “They were important supporters and we are disappointed that they don’t want their products measured by this standard anymore.”
The news complicates the work of CIOs at educational institutions where Apple has a strong presence. Schools often push IT departments to make environmentally sound electronics purchases, as do an increasing number of corporations. But now even older models of Apple equipment are no longer certified.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, but referred to Apple’s website which contains reports on the environmental impact of its products. Apple offers several recycling programs through its stores and website.
One of Apple’s newest products, the MacBook Pro with a high-resolution “Retina” display, was nearly impossible to fully disassemble, said Kyle Wiens, co-founder of iFixit.com, a website that provides directions for users to repair their own machines. The battery was glued to the case, and the glass display was glued to its back. The product, released just a month ago, had not been submitted for EPEAT certification, according to the organization.
Frisbee said that the structure of that laptop would have made it ineligible for certification. “If the battery is glued to the case it means you can’t recycle the case and you can’t recycle the battery,” Frisbee said.
Apple was putting design first in an effort to make products smaller and have batteries last longer, said Shaw Wu an analyst at Sterne Agee. “They are not trying to purposely make it hard to open, they are just trying to pack as much as they can into a small space–it’s a design decision,” Wu said.
Many corporations like Ford, HSBC, and Kaiser Permanente require their CIOs to purchase computers from sources that are EPEAT certified, said Sarah O’Brien director of outreach for EPEAT. And the U.S. government requires that 95% of the electronics it purchases be EPEAT certified.
In 2010, the last year the survey was conducted, 222 out of the 300 American universities with the largest endowments asked their IT departments to give preference to EPEAT certified computers. Around 70 of the schools required EPEAT certification for electronics purchases, according to O’Brien.
But though Apple still gets 10%-15% of its revenue from educational organizations, according to Wu, an increasing part of its product mix is made up of iPhones and iPads, which are not currently certifiable under EPEAT.
Wu said he believes Apple will likely soon create an alternate standard for its own products. But in the meantime he believes companies are likely to still buy the products.
“At the end of the day in a business it’s really about what works,” Wu said.

Unborn babies are exposed in the womb to synthetic chemicals. Companies can choose to remove them chemicals from products if they wish.
Will writing to the companies make a difference?
Due to our campaign to reduce toxic pollution, Samsung, Nokia andPuma have announced plans to phase out toxic chemicals in all theirproducts. Sony is removing them from their TV's. This is due topressure from publishing the companies' chemicals policy on the web. Ifa huge company like Samsung can do it then there is no reason othercompanies cannot follow suit to help protect the environment.
But big brands like Dell, HP/Compaq, Apple and IBM have all refused to take this positive step. Make them think again by writing to say you'll choose a more responsible company the next time you make a purchase.
Why are chemicals in products important?
Samsung and Nokia produce millions of electronics items each year.Going toxics free means less pollution and worker exposure duringproduction, less chemicals in your home during use and easier, cleanerrecycling and disposal. These voluntary measures are good, but othercompanies will never change unless they are forced to by law. Only thenwill these toxic chemicals be brought under control.
What about those laws?
Current regulation of chemicals is weak and inadequate. Almosteveryone has dozens of man-made chemicals in their body, the effects ofthese chemical cocktails on our health are unknown. In Europe the EU isdrafting new laws, that would set a world standard, to better controlthese chemicals.
While better chemical control should be welcomed by all, it is underattack from predictable quarters. The chemical industry has been scaremongering with exaggerated claims of job losses and declining profits.It has also recruited dirty industries best friend, the BushAdministration, to threaten Europe with a World Trade Organisationlawsuit if it dares to try and cut toxic pollution.
The best way to counter inaccurate industry lobbying is to haveother companies' show they can do without toxic chemicals. The list isgrowing - Ikea, H&M, Marks&Spencer, Nokia, Samsung and Puma areleading the way. Adidas, Unilever and Sony are heading in the rightdirection.

There are encouraging signs that electronic goods such as PCs and mobile phones could become ‘greener’, according to the latest review of electronics manufacturers’ policies published by Greenpeace today. The latest version of the Greenpeace ‘Guide to Greener Electronics’(1) which ranks 14 top manufacturers of PC's and mobile phones, shows that most companies have demonstrated commitments to greener manufacturing processes, such as eliminating the use of the most hazardous chemicals, and recycling policies such as financing take-back, reuse or recycling of end-of-life products. Apple, however, lags far behind the competition, presently occupying the last place in the ranking guide.
""We are witnessing a global shift towards greener PCs, with Acer and Lenovo, two major producers of PCs, committing to eliminate the use of the most hazardous chemicals from their products range,"" said Iza Kruszewska, Greenpeace International toxics campaigner, ""Most companies now score above average points on the ranking guide, with only five companies failing to score even the average of five points. The top-ranked brands have adopted a precautionary chemical policy by committing to eliminate the use of the most hazardous chemicals in their products. They have acknowledged that as producers, they bear individual responsibility for financing the take-back and responsible reuse or recycling of their own-brand discarded products.""
Nokia continues to hold the top spot in the ranking, with progressive policies on both, its chemicals policy as well as disposal. of electronic waste. However, the company is yet to outline clear timelines for phasing out PVC in all its products.
""In sharp contrast, Apple is awarded the last position because the company has made absolutely no improvements to its policies or practices since the ranking was first released three months ago, although most of its competitors have improved environmental policies,"" said Kruszewska, ""Despite being the world leader in innovation and design, Apple is losing the race by failing to keep up with the other companies.""
Motorola has been the fastest mover in the ranking guide. Although the company was ranked second worst in the first version of the guide, it has made strong commitments in the interim, and has moved up the ranking to come in at fourth place. Lenovo has also made strong policy commitments, to jump from the bottom spot up to its current 8th place. Fujitsu-Siemens and Acer made substantial progress and are now ranked 3rd and 7th respectively, moving up from their earlier 10th and 12th positions.
LGE, Samsug and Sony have lost points for failing to act on their commitments to individual producer responsibility (IPR). instead, the companies are supporting regulation in the US that would place the responsibility for product recycling on consumers instead of producers.
In September 2006, HP was given a 'penalty' - one point was deducted from the company's overall score when Greenpeace scientists' analysis of an HP laptop revealed the presence of decaBDE, a type of brominated flame retardant that HP claimed it no longer used. HP was quick to respond to investigate the matter and has now released a statement on its website that reaffirms its commitment not to use decaBDE, explains how decaBDE came to be found in the HP laptop and details what action has been taken to avoid similar problems in the future - at which point the penalty was lifted. (2)
""Companies seem to respond to competition rather than conscience. By turning the spotlight onto top electronics companies and challenging them to outrank their competition, the ""Guide to Greener Electronics"" has succeeded in motivating companies to improve their policies on chemicals and waste,"" concluded Kruszewska.

It’s the Economy

At first, I thought it was my imagination. Around the time the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, in September, I noticed that my sad old iPhone 4 was becoming a lot more sluggish. The battery was starting to run down much faster, too. But the same thing seemed to be happening to a lot of people who, like me, swear by their Apple products. When I called tech analysts, they said that the new operating system (iOS 7) being pushed out to existing users was making older models unbearably slow. Apple phone batteries, which have a finite number of charges in them to begin with, were drained by the new software. So I could pay Apple $79 to replace the battery, or perhaps spend 20 bucks more for an iPhone 5C. It seemed like Apple was sending me a not-so-subtle message to upgrade.
Of course, there are more benign explanations. The new software and recent app updates offer fancy new features that existing users want. maybe the battery is sealed with tiny five-point screws for aesthetic considerations. Perhaps, but this isn’t the first time that tech analysts and random crazies on the Internet have noted that breakdowns in older Apple products can often coincide with when upgrades come onto the market. Many have taken this as evidence of “planned obsolescence,” a term that dates to the Great Depression, when a real estate broker suggested that the government should stimulate the economy by placing artificial expiration dates on consumer products so people would buy more.
To conspiracy-theory-hungry observers (and some of the rest of us), it might make sense that Apple would employ this business strategy. The tech giant, after all, has reached near-saturation levels in the U.S. smartphone market. If iPhones work forever, people who already own the devices won’t buy new ones. Furthermore, selling products with finite life spans can be good for consumers, depending on their tastes and how informed they are. The fashion industry, whose entire mission is to essentially render products obsolete long before they cease to be functional, does this regularly. I buy clothes from H&M and other low-cost, trend-driven stores knowing full well that the pieces might fall apart after a year’s worth of washes. And if the clothes won’t be fashionable next year anyway, who cares? Improving the durability — and thereby cost — of the clothes would probably just drive away price-sensitive shoppers like me. Apple has similar considerations. Would the additional longevity of the battery be valuable enough to its core consumers to justify the inevitable higher price?
Economists have theories about market conditions that encourage planned obsolescence. A company has strong incentives to degrade product durability when it has a lot of market power and when consumers don’t have good substitute products to choose from. (That’s what happened with the international light-bulb cartel of the early 20th century, which penalized its members for manufacturing bulbs that lasted more than 1,000 hours.) When Apple started making the iPhone in 2007, its product was so innovative that it could have deliberately degraded durability without fear. But in the last couple years, the company has faced stiffer competition from Samsung and HTC, among others, which should deincentivize planned obsolescence. “Buyers are smart, and if they start figuring out that one of the costs of buying Apple’s products is that they’re constantly nickel-and-diming you, they’ll switch,” said Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.
Well, maybe. A company could still be encouraged to engage in planned obsolescence if consumers perceive large “switching costs” associated with going to a new brand. There are plenty of economics textbooks to choose from, for instance, and yet publishers still artificially make their old editions unusable by changing pagination or scrambling homework questions because they know teachers don’t want to deal with learning a whole new book.
Similarly, iPhone users have probably purchased complementary products, like apps, that won’t transfer to Android phones. They also probably have a network of iPhone-using friends with whom they can chat free using Apple’s Messages app (instead of paying for text messages). These switching costs increase Apple’s incentives to force its existing customers to upgrade by making older models gradually become more dysfunctional.
There is, however, a simple way to effectively render an old product obsolete without fleecing your existing customers. Instead of degrading the old model, companies can offer innovations in the new model that make upgrading irresistible. Apple succeeded at doing this for a while, offering new iPhones that included major improvements. In the past, consumers were so excited about the cool new features, like Siri, the voice-activated interface, that they may not have minded (or even noticed) if their old phones started to deteriorate. they planned on upgrading anyway. This time around, that’s less true. The iPhone 5S and 5C offer fewer quantum improvements. Consumers are more likely to want their old phones to continue working at peak condition in perpetuity, and to feel cheated when they don’t.
When major innovations remain out of reach, and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal customers, companies like Apple can still take a cue from the fashion industry. If you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than functional reasons, you still have a shot at harvesting more sales from your existing customer base. But it seems Apple may have already figured this out too. Just check out the wait times for the iPhone 5S in that shiny new gold color.

Rumors. It's all just rumors. But talk about the iPhone 7 headphone jack has got Apple devotees angry. Over a quarter million have signed a petition demanding the company keep the 3.5mm technology.
Rumors about the iPhone headphone jack started soon after the iPhone 6 was released in 2014. People were noticing problems with the sound. Either it would cut out completely or, if the jack moved in its socket, the sound would drop out on one ear or become distorted.
I know this from personal experience. After four years of abstinence, I conceded it was time to upgrade to a phone with a functioning home button - but what I got was a phone with a bung headphone jack. And I wasn't alone.
Online, I began to type in the keywords ""iPhone 6 headphone jack"" and Google, faithfully as ever, auto-completed my thoughts with the word ""problems.""
Various people suspected Apple had purposely installed an inferior headphone jack to use its ""art of gentle persuasion"" to get us all to adopt more wireless technology, such as Bluetooth headphones. (Thanks, Father Christmas.)
But there was little talk at the time of its expanding the Lightning port, which is currently used for power and data transfer, to include audio.
Now it looks as though this is definitely in the works.
The problem is more than quarter of a million Apple ""devotees"" are dead set against it.
Online petition slams 'planned obsolescence'
The petition, launched using the consumer website sumofus.org, complains that Apple ""is about to rip off every one of its customers. Again.""
But will Apple listen?
Citing articles published by Forbes and FastCompany earlier this month - articles which appear to confirm rumors about the new iPhone and its headphone jack - sumofus.org says Apple will ""singlehandedly create mountains of electronic waste - that likely won't get recycled.""
It will also mean, says the site, that customers will have to ""dole out additional cash to replace their hi-fi headphones.""
There is no doubt Apple has a keen financial interest in advancing music and headphone technology. It bought Beats Music and Beats Electronics in 2014 - the same year those original rumors started - for $3 billion (2.75 billion euros). It will want to see cash returns. And it needs to keep up with competitors, such as Samsung and the Android clan.
So far, Apple has always sold its iPhones and iPods with headphones. The ""confirmed leaks"" suggest it may continue to do so, while offering a premium-style product, with added features, for sale on the side. It may also provide or sell an adapter to allow customers to keep using their old ""cans.""
Counting down the wires
These rumors tend to start when deals between Apple and other companies emerge. It may be a deal with technology manufacturer Foxxconn to build the phones, or Apple puts in a large order for a particular component and macrumors.com connects the dots.
Failing that, someone is always bound to ""accidentally"" lose a mock-up of the new phone in a public bar.
In this case, it appears Apple has been working closely with Cirrus Logic on the audio chipset for its phones, and with Wolfson Microelectronics, which Cirrus Logic owns, to adapt the Lightning port to enable it to work with audio. The port may also include noise-cancelling technology.
This would mean you could power your phone, transfer data, and listen to music all via the one port. And the move wouldn't be a surprise - it would be in line with other developments at Apple.
In 2015, it released a new MacBook featuring just the one USB-C port for power, data and video transfer.
Determined to move forward
A new iPhone Lightning port may be more energy efficient.
It could also mean the iPhone 7 is slimmer (and, I imagine, more prone to bending), waterproof and compatible with wireless charging technology. Though the Apple Watch allows wireless conductive charging, Apple lags behind Samsung on wireless charging for phones - so it would be about time.
Apple has a reputation for moving forward with technology, regardless of what the punters say. It was like that with the 3.5-inch floppy disk, pre-USB connectors, Firewire, CD/DVD drives and the various power plugs we've known, loved and dumped since the first iPod.
So who can say whether the company will listen to anything anyone has to say, including those who have signed the sumofus.org petition?
""Apple only invested in renewable energy, and began phasing out toxic chemicals when public pressure became too strong to ignore,"" says the site. ""People power did it before, and we can do it again.""
Possibly. But the company would have considered it just another technological advance to move with the ""environmental times.""
In its 2015 report, the company writes, ""Since 1994, we have diverted more than 508 million pounds of equipment from landfills,"" writes the company in its. And Apple knows statements like that sound so good.
But its ""508 million pounds of equipment"" doesn't include all the Apple devices, laptops, and cables I have saved from landfill in the last 20 years (they are in the cellar instead). They include devices which would still work if only they would still... work."ÿÿiPhone 7 petition: Apple 'screwing customers and planet' with headphone jack | DW | 14.01.2016

Apple is about to rip off every one of its customers. Again.
Forbes and FastCompany are reporting that Apple plans to ditch the standard 3.5mm headphone jack when it releases the iPhone 7 later this year. Only a massive international campaign can force Apple to change course now.
Not only will this force iPhone users to dole out additional cash to replace their hi-fi headphones, it will singlehandedly create mountains of electronic waste -- that likely won't get recycled. According to the United Nations, up to 90% of the world's electronic waste is illegally traded or dumped each year.
Tell Apple to respect its customers and our planet. Keep the standard headphone jack.
This is right out of the Apple corporate playbook. A few years ago it swapped out the original iPod-dock connector with a new one, making countless cords, cables and chargers obsolete.
Apple plays up its green credentials, but the truth is that Apple only invested in renewable energy, and began phasing out toxic chemicals when public pressure became too strong to ignore. People power did it before, and we can do it again.
Tell Apple to keep the standard headphone jack and ditch planned obsolescence! #SaveJack

Two environmental proposals will be on the agenda at this year’s annual Apple shareholder meeting. Environmental group, Greenpeace, is rallying support for the proposals, while Apple’s Board of Directors is recommending shareholders vote against the proposals.
Greenpeace said they have 70 other groups supporting them as they publicly urge former Vice President and current Apple Board member Al Gore to use his influence with the Board. According to Greenpeace, Apple’s Board of Directors is due to send out a statement recommending that stockholders vote against two proposals that would strengthen Apple’s environmental policies.
“Vice President Gore, as a Board Member of Apple and owner of over $5 million in stock options, has the power to persuade the company to adopt stronger environmental policies. It would be shocking if Gore opposes any proposals calling for stronger environmental policies,” Said Rick Hind, Legislative Director of the Greenpeace USA Toxics campaign.
The proposals call on Apple to assess the phase-out of toxic chemicals, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and adopt a stronger e-waste “take-back” and recycling program.
Greenpeace said that Apple’s communication with shareholders calls these initiatives too “costly, time intensive and duplicative of existing [Apple] policies, initiatives and efforts,” and the Board of Directors “unanimously” recommends that shareholders not support the resolution.

The Washington Post today reported that Google, Apple, Facebook, Dropbox, Microsoft, Paltalk, AOL (TechCrunch’s parent company) and Yahoo participated in the so-called PRISM program which provided the NSA with what looks like virtually direct access to their servers and their users’ data.
We have now reached out to all of these companies and all of them have categorically denied that they are participating.
These denials are especially odd given that a number of publications, including USA Today, are now citing source that confirm the existence of this program. According to these reports, PRISM is not aimed at U.S. citizens or any person in the United States.
Here is what we got so far:
Facebook
“We do not provide any government organization with direct access to Facebook servers. When Facebook is asked for data or information about specific individuals, we carefully scrutinize any such request for compliance with all applicable laws, and provide information only to the extent required by law.”
Google
“Google cares deeply about the security of our users’ data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time, people allege that we have created a government ‘back door’ into our systems, but Google does not have a backdoor for the government to access private user data.”
Apple
Apple gave this the statement to AllThingsD:
“We have never heard of PRISM. We do not provide any government agency with direct access to our servers, and any government agency requesting customer data must get a court order.”
Microsoft
“We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we don’t participate in it.”
Yahoo
“Yahoo! takes users’ privacy very seriously. We do not provide the government with direct access to our servers, systems, or network.”
Dropbox
“We’ve seen reports that Dropbox might be asked to participate in a government program called PRISM. We are not part of any such program and remain committed to protecting our users’ privacy.”
Paltalk
“We have not heard of PRISM. Paltalk exercises extreme care to protect and secure users’ data, only responding to court orders as required to by law. Paltalk does not provide any government agency with direct access to its servers.”

WASHINGTON — The federal government has been secretly collecting information on foreigners overseas for nearly six years from the nation’s largest Internet companies like Google, Facebook and, most recently, Apple, in search of national security threats, the director of national intelligence confirmed Thursday night.
The confirmation of the classified program came just hours after government officials acknowledged a separate seven-year effort to sweep up records of telephone calls inside the United States. Together, the unfolding revelations opened a window into the growth of government surveillance that began under the Bush administration after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and has clearly been embraced and even expanded under the Obama administration.
Government officials defended the two surveillance initiatives as authorized under law, known to Congress and necessary to guard the country against terrorist threats. But an array of civil liberties advocates and libertarian conservatives said the disclosures provided the most detailed confirmation yet of what has been long suspected about what the critics call an alarming and ever-widening surveillance state.
The Internet surveillance program collects data from online providers including e-mail, chat services, videos, photos, stored data, file transfers, video conferencing and log-ins, according to classified documents obtained and posted by The Washington Post and then The Guardian on Thursday afternoon.
In confirming its existence, officials said that the program, called Prism, is authorized under a foreign intelligence law that was recently renewed by Congress, and maintained that it minimizes the collection and retention of information “incidentally acquired” about Americans and permanent residents. Several of the Internet companies said they did not allow the government open-ended access to their servers but complied with specific lawful requests for information.
“It cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States,” James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement, describing the law underlying the program. “Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats.”
The Prism program grew out of the National Security Agency’s desire several years ago to begin addressing the agency’s need to keep up with the explosive growth of social media, according to people familiar with the matter.
The dual revelations, in rapid succession, also suggested that someone with access to high-level intelligence secrets had decided to unveil them in the midst of furor over leak investigations. Both were reported by The Guardian, while The Post, relying upon the same presentation, almost simultaneously reported the Internet company tapping. The Post said a disenchanted intelligence official provided it with the documents to expose government overreach.
Before the disclosure of the Internet company surveillance program on Thursday, the White House and Congressional leaders defended the phone program, saying it was legal and necessary to protect national security.
Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, told reporters aboard Air Force One that the kind of surveillance at issue “has been a critical tool in protecting the nation from terror threats as it allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities, particularly people located inside the United States.” He added: “The president welcomes a discussion of the trade-offs between security and civil liberties.”
The Guardian and The Post posted several slides from the 41-page presentation about the Internet program, listing the companies involved — which included Yahoo, Microsoft, Paltalk, AOL, Skype and YouTube — and the dates they joined the program, as well as listing the types of information collected under the program.
The reports came as President Obama was traveling to meet President Xi Jinping of China at an estate in Southern California, a meeting intended to address among other things complaints about Chinese cyberattacks and spying. Now that conversation will take place amid discussion of America’s own vast surveillance operations.
But while the administration and lawmakers who supported the telephone records program emphasized that all three branches of government had signed off on it, Anthony Romero of the American Civil Liberties Union denounced the surveillance as an infringement of fundamental individual liberties, no matter how many parts of the government approved of it.
“A pox on all the three houses of government,” Mr. Romero said. “On Congress, for legislating such powers, on the FISA court for being such a paper tiger and rubber stamp, and on the Obama administration for not being true to its values.”
Others raised concerns about whether the telephone program was effective.
Word of the program emerged when The Guardian posted an April order from the secret foreign intelligence court directing a subsidiary of Verizon Communications to give the N.S.A. “on an ongoing daily basis” until July logs of communications “between the United States and abroad” or “wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls.”
On Thursday, Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the top Democrat and top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, said the court order appeared to be a routine reauthorization as part of a broader program that lawmakers have long known about and supported.
“As far as I know, this is an exact three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years,” Ms. Feinstein said, adding that it was carried out by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court “under the business records section of the Patriot Act.”
“Therefore, it is lawful,” she said. “It has been briefed to Congress.”
While refusing to confirm or to directly comment on the reported court order, Verizon, in an internal e-mail to employees, defended its release of calling information to the N.S.A. Randy Milch, an executive vice president and general counsel, wrote that “the law authorizes the federal courts to order a company to provide information in certain circumstances, and if Verizon were to receive such an order, we would be required to comply.”
Sprint and AT&T have also received demands for data from national security officials, according to people familiar with the requests. Those companies as well as T-Mobile and CenturyLink declined to say Thursday whether they were or had been under a similar court order.
Lawmakers and administration officials who support the phone program defended it in part by noting that it was only for “metadata” — like logs of calls sent and received — and did not involve listening in on people’s conversations.
The Internet company program appeared to involve eavesdropping on the contents of communications of foreigners. The senior administration official said its legal basis was the so-called FISA Amendments Act, a 2008 law that allows the government to obtain an order from a national security court to conduct blanket surveillance of foreigners abroad without individualized warrants even if the interception takes place on American soil.
The law, which Congress reauthorized in late 2012, is controversial in part because Americans’ e-mails and phone calls can be swept into the database without an individualized court order when they communicate with people overseas. While the newspapers portrayed the classified documents as indicating that the N.S.A. obtained direct access to the companies’ servers, several of the companies — including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple — denied that the government could do so. Instead, the companies have negotiated with the government technical means to provide specific data in response to court orders, according to people briefed on the arrangements.
“Google cares deeply about the security of our users’ data,” the company said in a statement. “We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time, people allege that we have created a government ‘backdoor’ into our systems, but Google does not have a ‘backdoor’ for the government to access private user data.”
While murky questions remained about the Internet company program, the confirmation of the calling log program solved a mystery that has puzzled national security legal policy observers in Washington for years: why a handful of Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee were raising cryptic alarms about Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the law Congress enacted after the 9/11 attacks.
Section 215 made it easier for the government to obtain a secret order for business records, so long as they were deemed relevant to a national security investigation.
Section 215 is among the sections of the Patriot Act that have periodically come up for renewal. Since around 2009, a handful of Democratic senators briefed on the program — including Ron Wyden of Oregon — have sought to tighten that standard to require a specific nexus to terrorism before someone’s records could be obtained, while warning that the statute was being interpreted in an alarming way that they could not detail because it was classified.
On Thursday, Mr. Wyden confirmed that the program is what he and others have been expressing concern about. He said he hoped the disclosure would “force a real debate” about whether such “sweeping, dragnet surveillance” should be permitted — or is even effective.
But just as efforts by Mr. Wyden and fellow skeptics, including Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Mark Udall of Colorado, to tighten standards on whose communications logs could be obtained under the Patriot Act have repeatedly failed, their criticism was engulfed in a clamor of broad, bipartisan support for the program.
“If we don’t do it,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, “we’re crazy.”
And Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, claimed in a news conference that the program helped stop a significant domestic terrorist attack in the United States in the last few years. He gave no details.
It has long been known that one aspect of the Bush administration’s program of surveillance without court oversight involved vacuuming up communications metadata and mining the database to identify associates — called a “community of interest” — of a suspected terrorist.
In December 2005, The New York Times revealed the existence of elements of that program, setting off a debate about civil liberties and the rule of law. But in early 2007, Alberto R. Gonzales, then the attorney general, announced that after months of extensive negotiation, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had approved “innovative” and “complex” orders bringing the surveillance programs under its authority.

When September rolls around you can always count on three things – the kids will go back to school, the days will get shorter and cooler, and Apple will release a new iPhone.
Like clockwork, Apple has released a new iPhone – and a new version of its mobile operating system – once yearly since it first unveiled the flagship smartphone in 2007.
The product cycle is so fast, rumours about the iPhone 8 began circulating the web even before Apple had unveiled the new iPhone 7.

But the company is increasingly coming under fire for engaging in a marketing practice known as “planned obsolescence” – a method of making products with shorter lifespans, or making current generation products seem obsolete in order to sell a “new and improved” version.
Story continues below advertisement
A petition created by online consumer group SumOfUS in July accused Apple of “sabotaging” devices with software upgrades designed to significantly slow down older models and force users to upgrade.
“Anyone with a perfectly functional iPhone or iPad bought two years ago would do well to ignore the prompts to ‘Install Now,’” reads the petition.
“But Apple will be pushing upgrade notices to millions of those customers anyway, because every frustrated user with a sluggish device is another sales prospect.”

The petition has since been signed by over 300,000 users urging Apple to extend the lifespan of their devices.
What is planned obsolescence?
The concept of planned obsolescence is not new – the marketing tactic was popularized in the 1920’s by Alfred Sloan, president of General Motors, when he created “model years” for cars.
It started with the 1923 Chevrolet. The car itself featured a new exterior and flashy cosmetic features, but the framework and mechanics were exactly the same as the cars GM had been producing for years.
Adding the model year to the name made the product seem desirable and new, despite the lack of changes.

But the entire tech industry – not just Apple – is often accused of using planned obsolescence thanks to consumer demand for things like smartphones and laptops.
For example, according to research from Green Alliance UK, the average laptop has a high likelihood of breaking within three to four years, which could help drive sales.
“As business became our dominate paradigm, we’ve adapted to this idea that change and innovation is the most important thing in the world,” Joanne McNeish, associate professor of marketing at Ryerson’s Ted Rogers School of Management, told Global News.
“[But] the tech industry has operated unregulated, for the most part, so they set their own rules – and businesses usually set rules that are advantageous to them.”
McNeish believes the smartphone market in particular tends to drive planned obsolescence because the market is so competitive.
WATCH: Apple unveils the iPhone 7
But the marketing expert said consumers often point the finger at Apple because they have been such a dominate player.
“Their brand persona is very arrogant – it attracts people’s attention. There is nothing we like better than watching someone who can do no wrong suddenly stumble and appear to be faltering,” said McNeish.
“It’s something they are renowned for and it comes from a place in their brand where they say, ‘This is what’s best for you.’”
But, if the SumOfUs petition is any indication, a growing number of consumers seem to have had enough with Apple telling them what’s best.
A smartphone that keeps consumers satisfied for five years doesn’t exist
Some experts argue that consumer attitude is driving quick product cycles.
“We’ve entered a world where having the latest, most capable phone in our pockets is something that’s expected – it’s not a luxury,” said Neil Bearse, director of marketing at Queen’s University’s Smith School of Business.
“Because of the sophistication of our devices, they are becoming increasingly disposable as the next thing comes out.”
Bearse noted that because of the growth and development we’ve seen from smartphones over the last few years, it’s unrealistic for consumers to think a five-year-old smartphone will keep up with new devices.

That being said – some have pointed out that Apple’s latest iPhone innovations have been lack lustre.
“It certainly feels like Apple (and, to be fair, its rivals) aren’t really coming up with mind-blowing breakthroughs lately. So there’s a big difference between lusting after tech that really seems better — and feeling like you’re being forced to “upgrade” to something that’s just slightly better,” technology journalist Rob Walker.
“I suppose they could solve the problem by blowing our minds with amazing new improvements and breakthroughs — but, easier said than done.”

Apple CEO Tim Cook recently realized he has a problem: He uses technology too much for his own good.
After Apple debuted Screen Time, a new iOS feature aimed to combat tech addition, at the Worldwide Developer Conference on Monday, Cook tried it and admits it led to a rude awakening about his own phone use. ""I've been using it and I have to tell you, I thought I was fairly disciplined about this. And I was wrong,"" Cook told CNN in an interview Monday.
""When I began to get the data, I found I was spending a lot more time than I should,"" Cook said. ""I also found that the number of notifications I was getting just didn't make sense anymore.""
Screen Time shows iPhone and iPad users how much time they are spending on their phone, which apps they are using the most and how many notifications they get — all as a way to make people more mindful about their tech use.
The new iOS feature appears not long after two prominent Apple investors, Jana Partners, LLC, and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, said that Apple was responsible for helping consumers better understand and manage their tech habits in a letter they sent to Apple's board of directors.
""More than 10 years after the iPhone's release, it is a cliché to point out the ubiquity of Apple's devices among children and teenagers, as well as the attendant growth in social media use by this group,"" they stated in the letter. ""What is less well known is that there is a growing body of evidence that, for at least some of the most frequent young users, this may be having unintentional negative consequences.""
Earlier this year, Cook said that, although he doesn't have any kids, he does set tech limits on his nephew: ""There are some things that I won't allow. I don't want them on a social network.""
On Monday, Cook still maintained that ""the device is not addictive in and of itself. It's what you do on it,"" adding that, ""Whether the word is 'addiction' or not, I don't know.""
""Ultimately, each person has to make the decision when they get their numbers as to what they would like to do,"" Cook said.
Here's how Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, billionaire investor Mark Cuban and media mogul Arianna Huffington have faced up to and dealt with their own tech habits.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) now uses only renewable energy sources to power its data centers, the iPhone maker said in an updated report on its environmental policies.
The company’s data centers now run on energy sources such as solar, wind and geothermal, instead of coal or other fossil fuels, Apple said on its website. The centers house server computers that store and distribute songs, applications and other content from services such as iTunes, iMessage and iCloud.
A year ago, Apple was targeted by Greenpeace International, which ranked Apple 12th out of 14 large technology companies in a report called “How Clean Is Your Cloud?” The environmental group, which held protests at Apple’s offices in Cupertino, California, charged Apple with relying on electricity from coal plants and gave Apple a grade of no better than D in the four categories it tracked.
“Increasing our use of renewable energy is our primary objective,” Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “We think these efforts will result in learnings that other companies and communities can benefit from as well.”
Apple’s announcement shows “real progress,” Greenpeace said, urging the company disclose more detail on how it’s working with utilities and state governments to achieve its energy goals.
“Apple’s increased level of disclosure about its energy sources helps customers know that their iCloud will be powered by clean energy sources, not coal,” Gary Cook, an analyst at Greenpeace, wrote in an e-mailed statement.
Solar Farm
Oppenheimer said a 100-acre (40-hectare) solar farm next to its largest data center, in Maiden, North Carolina, became fully operational in December. With the solar array and a large installation of fuel cells made by Bloom Energy Corp, which convert biogases into energy, Apple said it met a goal of generating 60 percent of the energy for the data center on-site.
“The power we are using in North Carolina is 100 percent renewable and zero percent coal,” Oppenheimer said.
Oppenheimer said Apple would double its solar capacity in Maiden after the construction of another nearby 100-acre solar farm by the of this year.
Apple also said a data center that is under construction in Prineville, Oregon, will also run on local renewable energy sources such as wind, hydro, solar and geothermal power.
Apple now gets 75 percent of its total power from renewable sources, up from 35 percent a year ago. The company’s four largest office campuses, in Ireland, Germany and two in California, now use 100 percent renewable energy sources, according to Oppenheimer.
Oppenheimer declined to disclose how much Apple spent on the equipment to generate its own power. He said Apple will keep investing in green technologies and isn’t focused on earning a financial return on the investments.

As vague ""unidentified sources"" continue to leak information about Apple's forthcoming tablet device, the company's former marketing manager has revealed supposed secrets on how the Cupertino, Calif., company operates. John Martellaro provided an analysis for The Mac Observer this week, giving insight into how Monday's leak on the tablet might have been given to The Wall Street Journal. Earlier this week, the paper reported that Apple will unveil its touchscreen tablet this month, and release it for sale in March. According to Martellaro, the story ""had all the earmarks of a controlled leak."" As a former senior marketing manager at Apple, he said he was told to leak information in the past. He said a senior company executive would ask him to release specific information to a trusted person at a major media outlet. Martellaro claims he was asked to ""idly mention"" the information in a telephone conversation, and to suggest to a reporter that publishing it would be ""nice."" E-mail correspondence was not allowed. ""The communication is always done in person or on the phone. Never via e-mail,"" he said. ""That's so that if there's ever any dispute about what transpired, there's no paper trail to contradict either party's version of the story. Both sides can maintain plausible deniability and simply claim a misunderstanding. That protects Apple and the publication."" The Journal's top technology commentator, Walt Mossberg, was bypassed, Martellaro alleged, to allow him to remain ""above the fray."" In addition, the story was leaked late Monday, after the stock market closed, so no one could suggest there was an attempt to manipulate Wall Street. Martellaro suggested there are a number of reasons Apple could have chosen to leak the information on Monday. They include, in his words:to light a fire under a recalcitrant partnerto float the idea of the US$1,000 price point and gauge reactionto panic/confuse a potential competitor about whom Apple had some knowledgeto whet analyst and observer expectations to make sure the right kind and number of people show up at the (presumed) January 26 event. Apple hates empty seats and demands SRO at these events While Apple sometimes leaks information to its advantage, it also goes to great lengths to control what is publicly said, and when. Apple's tight-lipped nature was profiled last year by the New York Times, which said the company's veil of secrecy began to take shape around the release of the original Macintosh back in 1984. One employee said that employees working on secret projects at Apple must ""pass through a maze of security doors, swiping their badges again and again and finally entering a numeric code to reach their offices."" Once inside the top-secret areas, employees are often monitored by surveillance cameras as they work. Those working with the most sensitive projects are allegedly instructed to ""cover up devices with black cloaks when they are working on them, and turn on a red warning light when devices are unmasked so that everyone knows to be extra-careful."" Last month, one report highlighted Apple's supposed ""Worldwide Loyalty Team,"" which are claimed to be a group of moles that spy on people and report directly to co-founder Steve Jobs and Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer. When an employee is suspected of a leak, the source claimed that they are under a ""gag order"" that involves the confiscation of cell phones and a total blackout of all unmonitored communication."ÿÿFormer Apple marketing manager describes company's 'controlled leaks'

The National Security Agency has obtained direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet giants, according to a top secret document obtained by the Guardian.
The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called Prism, which allows officials to collect material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, the document says.
The Guardian has verified the authenticity of the document, a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation – classified as top secret with no distribution to foreign allies – which was apparently used to train intelligence operatives on the capabilities of the program. The document claims ""collection directly from the servers"" of major US service providers.
Although the presentation claims the program is run with the assistance of the companies, all those who responded to a Guardian request for comment on Thursday denied knowledge of any such program.
In a statement, Google said: ""Google cares deeply about the security of our users' data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data.""
Several senior tech executives insisted that they had no knowledge of Prism or of any similar scheme. They said they would never have been involved in such a program. ""If they are doing this, they are doing it without our knowledge,"" one said.
An Apple spokesman said it had ""never heard"" of Prism.
The NSA access was enabled by changes to US surveillance law introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012.

The program facilitates extensive, in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information. The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating firms who live outside the US, or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US.
It also opens the possibility of communications made entirely within the US being collected without warrants.
Disclosure of the Prism program follows a leak to the Guardian on Wednesday of a top-secret court order compelling telecoms provider Verizon to turn over the telephone records of millions of US customers.
The participation of the internet companies in Prism will add to the debate, ignited by the Verizon revelation, about the scale of surveillance by the intelligence services. Unlike the collection of those call records, this surveillance can include the content of communications and not just the metadata.
Some of the world's largest internet brands are claimed to be part of the information-sharing program since its introduction in 2007. Microsoft – which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan ""Your privacy is our priority"" – was the first, with collection beginning in December 2007.
It was followed by Yahoo in 2008. Google, Facebook and PalTalk in 2009. YouTube in 2010. Skype and AOL in 2011. and finally Apple, which joined the program in 2012. The program is continuing to expand, with other providers due to come online.
Collectively, the companies cover the vast majority of online email, search, video and communications networks.
The extent and nature of the data collected from each company varies.
Companies are legally obliged to comply with requests for users' communications under US law, but the Prism program allows the intelligence services direct access to the companies' servers. The NSA document notes the operations have ""assistance of communications providers in the US"".
The revelation also supports concerns raised by several US senators during the renewal of the Fisa Amendments Act in December 2012, who warned about the scale of surveillance the law might enable, and shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces.
When the FAA was first enacted, defenders of the statute argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSA's inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. But the Prism program renders that consent unnecessary, as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies' servers.
A chart prepared by the NSA, contained within the top-secret document obtained by the Guardian, underscores the breadth of the data it is able to obtain: email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP (Skype, for example) chats, file transfers, social networking details, and more.

The document is recent, dating to April 2013. Such a leak is extremely rare in the history of the NSA, which prides itself on maintaining a high level of secrecy.
The Prism program allows the NSA, the world's largest surveillance organisation, to obtain targeted communications without having to request them from the service providers and without having to obtain individual court orders.
With this program, the NSA is able to reach directly into the servers of the participating companies and obtain both stored communications as well as perform real-time collection on targeted users.
The presentation claims Prism was introduced to overcome what the NSA regarded as shortcomings of Fisa warrants in tracking suspected foreign terrorists. It noted that the US has a ""home-field advantage"" due to housing much of the internet's architecture. But the presentation claimed ""Fisa constraints restricted our home-field advantage"" because Fisa required individual warrants and confirmations that both the sender and receiver of a communication were outside the US.
""Fisa was broken because it provided privacy protections to people who were not entitled to them,"" the presentation claimed. ""It took a Fisa court order to collect on foreigners overseas who were communicating with other foreigners overseas simply because the government was collecting off a wire in the United States. There were too many email accounts to be practical to seek Fisas for all.""
The new measures introduced in the FAA redefines ""electronic surveillance"" to exclude anyone ""reasonably believed"" to be outside the USA – a technical change which reduces the bar to initiating surveillance.
The act also gives the director of national intelligence and the attorney general power to permit obtaining intelligence information, and indemnifies internet companies against any actions arising as a result of co-operating with authorities' requests.
In short, where previously the NSA needed individual authorisations, and confirmation that all parties were outside the USA, they now need only reasonable suspicion that one of the parties was outside the country at the time of the records were collected by the NSA.
The document also shows the FBI acts as an intermediary between other agencies and the tech companies, and stresses its reliance on the participation of US internet firms, claiming ""access is 100% dependent on ISP provisioning"".
In the document, the NSA hails the Prism program as ""one of the most valuable, unique and productive accesses for NSA"".
It boasts of what it calls ""strong growth"" in its use of the Prism program to obtain communications. The document highlights the number of obtained communications increased in 2012 by 248% for Skype – leading the notes to remark there was ""exponential growth in Skype reporting. looks like the word is getting out about our capability against Skype"". There was also a 131% increase in requests for Facebook data, and 63% for Google.
The NSA document indicates that it is planning to add Dropbox as a PRISM provider. The agency also seeks, in its words, to ""expand collection services from existing providers"".
The revelations echo fears raised on the Senate floor last year during the expedited debate on the renewal of the FAA powers which underpin the PRISM program, which occurred just days before the act expired.
Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware specifically warned that the secrecy surrounding the various surveillance programs meant there was no way to know if safeguards within the act were working.
""The problem is: we here in the Senate and the citizens we represent don't know how well any of these safeguards actually work,"" he said.
""The law doesn't forbid purely domestic information from being collected. We know that at least one Fisa court has ruled that the surveillance program violated the law. Why? Those who know can't say and average Americans can't know.""
Other senators also raised concerns. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon attempted, without success, to find out any information on how many phone calls or emails had been intercepted under the program.
When the law was enacted, defenders of the FAA argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSA's inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. But the Prism program renders that consent unnecessary, as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies' servers.
When the NSA reviews a communication it believes merits further investigation, it issues what it calls a ""report"". According to the NSA, ""over 2,000 Prism-based reports"" are now issued every month. There were 24,005 in 2012, a 27% increase on the previous year.

""It's shocking enough just that the NSA is asking companies to do this,"" he said. ""The NSA is part of the military. The military has been granted unprecedented access to civilian communications.
""This is unprecedented militarisation of domestic communications infrastructure. That's profoundly troubling to anyone who is concerned about that separation.""
A senior administration official said in a statement: ""The Guardian and Washington Post articles refer to collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This law does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person located within the United States.
""The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch, and Congress. It involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-US persons outside the US are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about US persons.
""This program was recently reauthorized by Congress after extensive hearings and debate.
""Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats.
""The Government may only use Section 702 to acquire foreign intelligence information, which is specifically, and narrowly, defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This requirement applies across the board, regardless of the nationality of the target.""

Deforestation in Indonesia<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/10816734@N03/2118583942/"">World Bank Photo Collection</a>/Flickr
If you’ve ever bought toilet paper, a bucket of KFC chicken, or photocopy paper, there’s a decent chance that it came from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third largest paper producer in the world. There’s also a chance that that paper was made from the quickly disappearing Indonesian rainforest—which is why activists and environmental organizations have long labeled Asia Pulp & Paper a “forest criminal” for destroying this precious habitat. But Tuesday, APP and environmental activists came together to announce a new conservation policy that they say will stop the company’s destruction of virgin forests forever.
APP has pledged to develop plantations only on land that is not rainforest or land that has already been cleared—and on February 1, it halted its bulldozers in the pristine forests that are home to species like the Sumatran tiger and the orangutan. The company has also committed to consult with indigenous and local communities on any proposed new plantations. The Forest Trust, a non-profit that works with corporations to instate sustainable forest practices, will monitor the implementation of the new policy.
The agreement on third-party evaluation is significant, according to Scott Poynton, the executive director of the Forest Trust, which worked with APP to design the new policy. While the company has drawn criticism in the past for not living up to promised environmental changes, Poynton said that this new policy is much stronger than any previous pledges.
Arguably the trickiest part of all this is that the new policy applies not only to APP, but also to its business partners. as other corporations have found, controlling your whole supply chain can be difficult. But if it succeeds, the impact will be great: APP is a $6 billion company that produces 8.5 million tons of paper per year. The company and its suppliers control 6.4 million acres in Indonesia alone.
The Forest Trust, which began working with APP in February 2012, specializes in changing corporate giants from the inside. In 2010, it worked with Nestlé to get deforested products out of its supply chain. Poynton said the group’s strategy is to wait for companies to request help in devising sustainability plans. “We believe if we want to solve the problem we ought to work with the folks who are causing it,” he explained. Forest Trust has 50 staffers dedicated to ending deforestation in Indonesia, Poynton said, including experts in forestry, ecology, social science, and conflict resolution. Thirty of them have been working with APP to develop the new policy.
As Poynton was quick to point out, it was the campaigning from Greenpeace, Rainforest Action Network, and other environmental groups that pushed APP to the table in the first place. “This would never have happened without efforts of Greenpeace and other NGOS that campaigned against [APP],” he said. “But we also don’t think it could have happened without someone on the inside like us working with the company to figure out how to get there.”
Greenpeace has been campaigning against APP for years, exposing the company’s use of illegally logged trees and highlighting the ways in which its deforestation contributes to skyrocketing carbon emissions. Greenpeace and convinced more than 100 companies—including giants like Adidas, Kraft, Staples, and Nestlé—to stop doing business with APP. One of Greenpeace’s campaigns asked Barbie—a Mattel product—to “break up” with APP, which prompted the toy giant to stop sourcing paper from “controversial sources.”
“We don’t want any image of forest destruction or deforestation attached to us,” said an APP spokeswoman.
“I think APP is really seeing that pressure from the market,” said Bustar Maitar, the head of Greenpeace’s forest campaign in Indonesia. “There is no choice for them to keep their products in the international market. They have to do forest protection in Indonesia.”
Maitar is optimistic that the change could move the rest of the global paper and pulp market, too. “APP’s commitment will send a strong signal to the rest of the world to move on forest protection,” he said. “Otherwise they will lose their international market.”
Aida Greenbury, APP’s managing director of sustainability, told Mother Jones that the campaigns from Greenpeace and others didn’t directly hurt the company’s bottom line. But they did affect its reputation. “The loss we suffer mostly is linked to the image, the perception about APP,” said Greenbury. “If you want to be recognized as a true global leader, we don’t want any image of forest destruction or deforestation attached to us.”
Greenbury said that the commitment also reflects APP’s business interests. “Truthfully it’s not only about environmental and social sustainability, it’s also about economic sustainability as well,” she continued. “We need work with stakeholders not only in Indonesia but beyond, because we want to make sure that we don’t have a lost opportunity in the future to expand our market.”
While supportive of the announcement, Greenpeace’s Maitar conditioned his praise with the statement that Greenpeace will be monitoring APP’s success in putting its commitment into action. “For us this is the last opportunity of APP to make the commitment and implement it on the ground,” he said. “This is the golden opportunity for APP.”"ÿÿPaper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone.

Published August 21, 2019 by . Last Updated August 22, 2019. Progress for captive elephants! The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) just announced a new policy to phase out the use of bullhooks—heavy batons with a sharp metal hook on one end—to train or control elephants in zoos. The long-overdue AZA bullhook ban will end the routine use of these weapons by January 21, 2021, and end all use of them by January 1, 2023. In the policy, the AZA states that “bullhooks are not acceptable as daily management tools.” It also says that a “strong majority” of AZA zoos have already stopped using bullhooks and support getting rid of them. We couldn’t agree more.Bullhooks are used to beat and jab elephants. During training, elephants are struck, jabbed, poked, prodded, and even beaten with this sharp weapon. Eventually, even the sight of it elicits fear and full compliance. Bullhooks are frequently used by circus handlers (as shown in the photo below), but you may be surprised to learn that zoos also have a history of using these cruel devices to control elephants.This bullhook ban has been years in the making. Nearly a decade ago, in August 2010, the AZA announced a policy to end what’s known as “free contact” management of elephants, in which handlers work directly alongside elephants and are always armed with a bullhook, as is done in the circus. Instead, keepers were required to be separated from the animals by a protective barrier, except in limited circumstances. In this form of management, called “protected” or “restricted contact,” elephants are trained using rewards—not punishment—and can choose whether or not they want to participate in training. That policy—which was characterized as a worker-safety measure instead of an animal welfare initiative—was phased in over many years and was in full effect by 2017. However, the policy did not go so far as to ban the use of bullhooks entirely. While many zoos haven’t used these weapons in years, a few have continued to do so, even in cases of restricted contact.This decision marks a watershed moment for captive elephants and relegates zoos’ use of bullhooks—which cause fear and are already illegal in many cities and two states—to the history books. PETA has campaigned long and hard against the use of these cruel weapons and looks forward to seeing the AZA continue to make positive changes for elephants, including by opposing the importation of ones taken from their homelands and families.© iStock.com/pjmalsburyWant to Do More?

 Published October 1, 2019 by .  If you’ve ever held a Mason jar, you likely recognize the name of their most famous manufacturer, Ball Corporation. Thanks to PETA, this multibillion-dollar Fortune 500 food and beverage packaging giant will stop funding horrific experiments in which animals are crushed, paralyzed, cut open, drugged, or electrocuted.While another company now manufactures the world-famous Mason jars under the Ball name, Ball Corporation is still the world’s largest manufacturer of recyclable metal beverage and food containers, supplying packaging for Coke, Pepsi, Budweiser, Coors, and many other brands that are household names. It’s also one of four “Platinum Partners” (the highest partner level) with Wings for Life, a charity organization cofounded by the leader of energy drink maker Red Bull, which funds numerous cruel, deadly, and scientifically unsound spinal cord injury experiments on animals.Earlier this year, PETA urged Ball to end its support of animal testing in favor of more effective, ethical, and economical, non-animal methods—a protocol that many global food and beverage companies have adopted.© iStock.com/InessalJoined by three leading medical and spinal cord experts, we compiled and shared with Ball mounds of scientific evidence proving that the experiments on animals that the company was helping to fund are abusive and not beneficial to human health. Because of vast physiological differences between species, the only spinal cord injury drug available has been tested on numerous animals and resulted in drastically varying results. Nearly 96% of drugs that test safe and effective in animals end up failing in human clinical trials, wasting precious time and money.After comparing the solid scientific evidence that we presented with the excuses offered by Wings for Life that failed to justify these experiments, Ball agreed with PETA, and animals won. In a letter, Ball wrote to us:“Ball Corporation has reviewed your request and will adopt a policy that indicates that the company will not fund, conduct, or commission any tests on animals unless they are explicitly required by law.”Victory! And that’s not all. Ball is the first Wings for Life funding partner to distance itself from the organization’s shocking animal experiments. This means that the first major domino has fallen in cutting off funding for those experiments, pushing Wings for Life to adopt more effective, ethical, economical, animal-free research methods.In tests published since just last year and funded by Ball and others through Wings for Life, experimenters injured and killed more than 4,700 animals. In one of these obscene tests, experimenters inserted electrodes into a monkey’s muscles, forced her to perform stress-inducing tasks, cut open her spine, inserted electrodes into her spinal cord, and electrocuted her nerves before killing her.© iStock.com/Patrick GijsbersIn other tests sponsored by Wings for Life, experimenters bred genetically modified mice, repeatedly force-fed them drugs, cut open their spines, crushed and compressed their exposed spinal cords (partially paralyzing them), and only then killed and dissected them. And they dropped weights on pigs’ and rats’ spines to create crushing injuries before all these suffering animals were killed and dissected.PETA is calling on Wings for Life to end all funding of these inhumane and archaic animal experiments—and urging other partners of the charity to follow Ball’s lead in supporting only superior, non-animal research.We won, and so did animals.

PETA is celebrating, as Olivier Rousteing, creative director of Balmain, announced that he would no longer use fur in the following statement published on Vogue.com:  
I made the decision to not use fur about a year and a half ago. I saw so many documentaries and just thought, I cannot do this anymore. Now suppliers are working to make sure that faux fur can look like real fur, and it‘s already pretty insane what they can create. … [F]or me, if you decide to stop using fur, you don‘t go back. 
 
 PETA France previously contacted the company several times to ask it to implement a fur-free policy. It‘s great to see more and more designers and fashion houses, including Jean Paul Gaultier, Chanel, Versace, Prada, Victoria Beckham, and many others, ban fur from their collections. 
 This decision is a sign of the times, as the vast majority of people want nothing to do with garments made with the skin of animals who were caged and electrocuted, bludgeoned to death, or caught in steel traps, where many are left to die slowly from blood loss – which is the way coyotes are still being killed for the frivolous trim on Canada Goose‘s jackets. 
 Today, fur is as dead as the poor animals it was stolen from, and any designers not clued up enough to see that may as well hang up their sewing needles now.

Bank J. Safra Sarasin has given up in the fight with a former client about losses incurred through cum-ex investments. It will probably pay him some 45 million euros in compensation.
Erwin Mueller, the German founder of the Mueller drugstore chain, suffered a near-complete loss on an investment in cum-ex-funds issued by what used to be Sarasin private bank – today J. Safra Sarasin. He filed for compensation of some 45 million euros ($51 million).
Safra Sarasin has now decided to give up its fight against the claim, according to a report by «Handelsblatt». The bank will not appeal the verdict of a Stuttgart-based court and give back the money to the former client.
Tax Loophole
The bank has struggled for a long time against the defeat and Mueller, now 86, had to go through seven trials and verdicts to get back the investment. The bank should have informed him better about the risks involved in the cum-ex-product.
The case was the trigger for the much wider scandal that rocked Germany’s financial market, prompted searches by the police and led to the departure of Eric Sarasin, the former deputy head of the bank.
Of course, the billionaire wasn’t just another naïve investor lured into buying a risky product. He had bought funds in 2010 already and got himself a legal expertise about his investment.
Tax Scam
The cum-ex-investments have become known as one of the biggest tax scams ever, but the loopholes have been known for years and used by bankers and lawyers alike to save money.

One of two Starlinger Recostar dynamic 105 C-VAC at Calex. Photo: StarlingerAt Calex, a family-run company in the Romanian municipality Groși, approx. 600-700 tons of plastic waste are recycled each month. In July, the company installed a plastics recycling line type Recostar dynamic 105 C-VAC supplied by Starlinger recycling technology. With four Starlinger lines running in Romania and three more at the company headquarters Candi Plastic Recycling in Sollenau/Austria, the owners already operate a total of seven lines supplied by the Austrian machinery manufacturer.While the Romanian site processes post-consumer waste such as films and PE/PP pipes, the Austrian site recycles mainly industrial waste from plastics production such as rejects or production scrap. In addition, Candi intends to focus on big bag recycling with a new washing line that is scheduled to go into operation in December. In Austria, the lines need to be highly flexible to cope with the diversity of input materials. in Romania, the setup can be tailored to the fairly homogeneous material streams.Calex operates two Starlinger recycling lines type Recostar dynamic 105 C-VAC: One line processes big bags, the other line recycles colored, transparent and highly printed LDPE packaging films. During extrusion, the high ink content and the residual moisture after the washing process on the upstream washing lines can lead to the increased formation of gases. With the setup consisting of Smart feeder, continuous melt filter and C-VAC degassing module, both lines are well prepared for these challenges: Through densification and homogenization of the material and the resulting friction, the SMART feeder has a drying effect, and after removal of the residual contamination by the melt filter, the melt surface is increased by 300% in the C-VAC module, thereby allowing for the efficient extraction of gases.Collectors deliver the plastic waste that is sorted and recycled by 25 employees working at Calex. Among the companies who purchase the recycled material – mostly plastics converters such as injection and blow molders – are several regular customers. “Our regular customers have to be able to rely on the quality of the regranulate,” says Managing Director Gheorghe Campan. “We installed a second Starlinger ‘dynamic’ in July because the first line has proven its excellent suitability for post-consumer recycling. The lines are equipped with different filter systems, which gives us flexibility when processing material with contaminants such as aluminum, sand, and paper.”Despite the current recycling boom, the quantities recycled at Calex remain largely constant. As factors that could contribute to an increase in input quantities, Campan identifies the focus of manufacturers on the recyclability of their products (design for recycling) and EU requirements for a minimum proportion of recycled material in new products. Moreover, an increase in the currently fairly low prices for virgin plastics would favor the use of recycled materials."ÿÿSeventh Starlinger recycling line - RECYCLING magazine

She wrote to Bailey, stating, “Canada Goose’s ‘standards’ allow for coyotes to suffer for days in steel traps with a broken or bleeding leg before the trapper returns to shoot or bludgeon them to death, and the company’s jackets are stuffed with the down feathers of birds who died violently.”She added, “I urge you to make this year the last one in which you have Canada Goose as a sponsor, just as the Berlin International Film Festival cut ties with the company in 2017.”As a marketing ploy, Canada Goose sometimes gives away fur-trimmed, down-filled jackets to film crews and cast members when they’re shooting in cold climates. And all feature films at TIFF are up for an award sponsored by the company.But as long as the brand continues to pay for the fur of wild coyotes who were caught in painful steel traps and the feathers of birds who didn’t want to be killed, there’s no way for TIFF to continue accepting Canada Goose’s blood money and still be ethical.Remember: The only ones who need the fur and feathers are the animals themselves.As Anderson notes in her letter, so many innovative vegan materials can be used instead of animal-derived materials. Hundreds of fashion companies—including Chanel, Gucci, Michael Kors, The North Face, and Versace—have chosen to keep fur out of their lines. Instead of making the compassionate switch, Canada Goose is seemingly trying to hide exactly how coyotes and birds suffer and die for its products.Stand with Anderson, PETA, and countless other animal rights activists in demanding that Canada Goose stop using animal-derived materials for its clothing and accessories.

Washington, D.C., April 8, 2013 – Chiquita Brands International last week filed a ""reverse"" Freedom of Information lawsuit to block the release of records to the National Security Archive on the company's illegal payments to Colombian terrorist groups, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court. At issue are thousands of documents the company turned over to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 1998-2004 as part of an investigation of the company's illegal transactions with leftist insurgents and right-wing paramilitaries from the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).
Two years ago, the Archive published ""The Chiquita Papers,"" a declassified collection of more than 5,000 pages of internal Chiquita documents turned over to the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of a criminal investigation of more than $1.7 million in payments to the AUC over six years, and for nearly three years after the group was formally designated as a terrorist organization. That case resulted in a 2007 sentencing agreement in which Chiquita admitted to more than ten years of payments to a variety of Colombian guerrilla and paramilitary groups.
The Chiquita Papers included evidence that Chiquita and its Colombian subsidiary had received tangible benefits from those transactions, undermining one of the key aspects of the company's defense: that it had never received ""any actual security services or actual security equipment in exchange for the payments."" Chiquita's ""reverse"" FOIA complaint now claims that the news headlines based on the documents were part of ""a media campaign to publicize biased mischaracterizations of the documents.""
""We strongly reject Chiquita's assertion that we mischaracterized information found in their own corporate records,"" said Michael Evans, director of the Archive's Colombia Documentation Project. ""Chiquita admitted to more than a decade of regular payments to death squads and narcotraffickers,"" he added. ""Now, Chiquita wants to cover up the documents that would let us judge for ourselves whether those payments were extortion or security for banana operations, or both.""
Among the evidence that Chiquita did, in fact, benefit from its ""sensitive payments"" is a 1994 legal memo indicating that Colombian insurgents provided security at some of Chiquita's plantations in Colombia. The memo says that the general manager of Chiquita operations in Turbó told company attorneys that ""Guerrilla Groups"" were ""used to supply security personnel at the various farms."" A subsequent draft of the same memo includes annotations asking, ""Why is this relevant?"" and, ""Why is this being written?""
Another document published by the Archive in April 2011 shows that Chiquita also paid right-wing paramilitary forces for security services-including intelligence on guerrilla operations-after the AUC wrested control of the region from insurgents in the mid-1990s. The March 2000 memo, written by Chiquita Senior Counsel Robert Thomas and based on a conversation with managers from Chiquita's wholly-owned subsidiary, Banadex, indicates that paramilitaries formed a front company to disguise ""the real purpose of providing security."" The unidentified Banadex official said Chiquita ""should continue making the payments,"" because the company ""can't get the same level of support from the military.""
The ""reverse"" FOIA filing is the latest development in a four-and-a-half-year Archive legal effort to document Chiquita's financial relationships with illegal armed groups responsible for some of the worst human rights atrocities of Colombia's decades-old civil war. A ""reverse"" FOIA is a common lawsuit strategy, mostly used by contractors to prevent their cost-plus or profit-margin figures from being released by government agencies.
The new case is the direct outgrowth of a 2010 lawsuit in which the Archive sought to compel the SEC to process a pair of FOIA requests relating to the Chiquita investigation. More than three years later the agency made its final decision with respect to legal, financial and other documents Chiquita turned over to the SEC during the course of its inquiries, granting confidential treatment to only 45 pages among some 23 boxes of responsive material. Chiquita's ""reverse"" FOIA action follows multiple attempts on its part to convince the SEC to reverse that decision.
In making its case against disclosure of the ""Chiquita Payment Documents,"" the company cites FOIA Exemption (7)(B), which exempts from disclosure ""records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes"" to the extent that production ""would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication."" 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(B). Chiquita claims that it is subject to two pending ""adjudications,"" a consolidated civil suit filed in Florida on behalf of victims of the terrorist groups that Chiquita funded, and a preliminary criminal investigation now underway in Colombia.
Dismissing those arguments, SEC Associate General Counsel Richard M. Humes found that while the Florida case did indeed qualify as a ""trial or adjudication,"" he also determined ""that Chiquita did not demonstrate that public disclosure of the Chiquita Payment Documents 'would seriously interfere with the fairness of the pending adjudication.'""
With respect to the Colombia matter, Humes concluded that ""the criminal investigation pending in Colombia against current and former Chiquita employees and those of its subsidiary"" does not meet the standard necessary to withhold information, since Exemption 7(B) refers ""specifically to 'a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication' but does not apply to 'investigations.'"" Humes points out that Chiquita accurately characterized the Colombian matter as an ""investigation"" in several previous filings and ""only began referring to the investigation as the 'Colombian Fiscalía Proceeding' in its request for reconsideration.""

Chiquita, formerly known as the United Fruit Company, was until the 1990s the biggest banana company in the world, controlling about one third of world trade. Despite coming close to bankruptcy in 2000, the company stills holds second place in world sales figures, second only to Dole. In Latin America, Chiquita operates banana plantations or buys year-round in Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Ecuador, Colombia, Nicaragua and Mexico.
Chiquita is now controlled by orange juice giant Cutrale and financial conglomerate Grupo Safra (January 2015)
International framework agreement signed
Prior to 2000, Chiquita had a notoriously bad reputation on labour relations in Latin American countries. However, following an international campaign putting the spotlight on its social and environmental record in 1998 and 1999, the company made a welcome change in its attitude towards trade unions and non-government organisations.
In 2000, Chiquita agreed to negotiate an International Workers' Rights Agreement with the Coordination of Latin American Banana Workers' Unions (COLSIBA) and in 2001 an international framework agreement on minimum labour standards and trade union rights was signed by COLSIBA, the International Union of Food and Agricultural Workers (IUF) and Chiquita Brands International. The agreement was significant in that it also applied to Chiquita's suppliers, and has since empowered unions in countries such as Colombia and Honduras to organise previously non-unionised workers. In Costa Rica, where trade union persecution remains prevalent on the company's plantations, a special 'Conciliation Procedure' was negotiated, although the anti-union culture of local management has proved difficult to change.
Following a campaign in the early 1990s, Chiquita developed a partnership with US-based NGO Rainforest Alliance. By 2001, the company secured certification of all its Latin American plantations under the Rainforest Alliance’s ‘Better Banana Project' and was encouraging supplier plantations to become certified. The company also produced a Code of Conduct that includes the Social Accountability Initiative’s SA 8000 standard. In 2002, Chiquita joined the United Kingdom's Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI).
Concerns remain
The company's behaviour since the mid-2000s has however raised fears that the company may be reverting to its old style of operation. In 2007 and again in 2010, COLSIBA expressed serious concerns over a general failure by the company to address workers concerns at plantations in Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Wherever collective bargaining agreements existed, the local management seemed to drag its heels or seek reductions in benefits to workers. The Framework Agreement with IUF and COLSIBA remains intact and some issues have been successfully resolved, but trade unions are concerned that the spirit of openness shown in the first half of the decade has not survived changes in senior management.
Chiquita’s former operations in Colombia (they sold their interests to Banacol in 2003) were the subject of a landmark lawsuit in the US, which resulted in the company being fined $25 million as part of a settlement for having made payments to Colombian paramilitary groups, including the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), in exchange for local employee protection. In June 2016, under the Torture Victim Protection Act, a US judge allowed victims of Colombian paramilitary killings to continue with their lawsuit against former Chiquita executives, and in November 2016 a class action lawsuit was brought against the company. In March 2017, a class action complaint was filed in Florida against Chiquita executives accusing them of making payments to the AUC and allowing the AUC to use Chiquita's ports for illicit trading. These lawsuits are ongoing.
Despite these unresolved concerns, Chiquita remains - as of 2011 - the only transnational banana company to have a signed a regional framework agreement with banana workers' unions. The company also participates actively in the World Banana Forum, launched in 2009.

BANANA LINK URGENT ACTION REQUEST
On March 2nd, Guatemalan banana union leader, Miguel Angel Ramirez of SITRABANSUR, was shot dead. SITRABANSUR, which is affiliated to Banana Links Guatemala partner union UNSITRAGUA, was founded by Miguel Ramirez and his fellow workers at the 'Olga Maria' plantation in the Pacific South of Guatemala in July 2007. Since then SITRABANSUR members have been harassed and threatened by private security hired by the company -Frutera Internacional Sociedad Anónima, supplier to Chiquita Brands- and 24 union members have been sacked. UNSITRAGUA has been working with SITRABANSUR to support these sacked workers and strengthen union organisation on the Olga Maria plantation.
The murder of Miguel Angel Ramirez is just one of the many recent cases of violence against banana union leaders in Guatemala. In September 2007 SITRABI union leader, Marco Tulio Ramirez Portelo was also shot dead and just four weeks ago the daughter of the General Secretary of SITRABANSUR was raped by armed men.
Pressure must be put on the Guatemalan government to ensure that the people responsible for these killings are brought to justice and the systematic violations of labour rights are put to a stop. As a result of a previous international campaign led by the IUF, EUROBAN and COLSIBA, the new Guatemalan president, Alvaro Colom, promised to take action so that the previous murder of SITRABI union leader Marco Tulio Ramirez is investigated by the authorities. Political pressure is needed to get EU governments to criticise the Guatemalan government for their lack of action on these violent and shocking cases of trade union repression and ensure that Alvaro Colom sticks to his commitments to end impunity and violence in Guatemala.
ACTION: Write to Sr Mario Mena, representative of Chiquita subsidiary COBIGUA, asking him - in the face of a rapidly deteriorating security situation and in the framework of the regional trade union rights agreement between Chiquita, COLSIBA and UITA/IUF - to transmit to the company's supplier that it is completely unacceptable for Chiquita brand bananas to be sourced from a plantation with such an appalling record of violence towards employees, who are simply exercising their constitutional right to from a trade union.
Sr. Mario Mena's email address is: [email protected]
Please CC your mail to [email protected] Please contact Banana Link for more information and monitor the Banana Link website to support any further call of action from our Guatemalan trade union partners to end this violence against their fellow union leaders and bring the perpetrators to justice.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMONDAY, MARCH 19, 2007WWW.USDOJ.GOV
NSD(202) 514-2008TDD (202) 514-1888
WASHINGTON Chiquita Brands International Inc. (""Chiquita""), a multinational corporation incorporated in New Jersey and headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, pleaded guilty today before the Honorable Royce C. Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to one count of engaging in transactions with a specially-designated global terrorist, announced Assistant Attorney General Kenneth L. Wainstein National Security Division. U.S. Attorney Jeffrey A. Taylor. Wendy Wysong, Deputy Assistant Secretary, U.S. Department of Commerce (""Commerce""). and William Reid, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Washington, D.C. Office of Investigations.
Chiquita pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Chiquita's sentence will include a $25 million criminal fine, the requirement to implement and maintain an effective compliance and ethics program, and five years' probation. Chiquita also has agreed to cooperate in this ongoing investigation. Sentencing will occur on June 1, 2007.
The plea agreement arises from payments that Chiquita had made for years to the violent, right-wing terrorist organization United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia an English translation of the Spanish name of the group, ""Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia"" (commonly known as and referred to hereinafter as the ""AUC""). The AUC had been designated by the U.S. government as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (""FTO"") on Sept. 10, 2001, and as a Specially-Designated Global Terrorist (""SDGT"") on Oct. 31, 2001. These designations made it a federal crime for Chiquita, as a U.S. corporation, to provide money to the AUC. In April 2003, Chiquita made a voluntary self-disclosure to the government of its payments to the AUC, giving rise to this investigation.
""Like any criminal enterprise, a terrorist organization needs a funding stream to support its operations. For several years, the AUC terrorist group found one in the payments they demanded from Chiquita Brands International. Thanks to Chiquita's cooperation and this prosecution, that funding stream is now dry and corporations are on notice that they cannot make protection payments to terrorists,"" said Assistant Attorney General Wainstein.
""Funding a terrorist organization can never be treated as a cost of doing business,"" stated U.S. Attorney Taylor. ""American businesses must take note that payments to terrorists are of a whole different category. They are crimes. But like adjustments that American businesses made to the passage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act decades ago, American businesses, as good corporate citizens, will find ways to conform their conduct to the requirements of the law and still remain competitive.""
""This case clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Commerce Department and its Bureau of Industry and Security to the Administration's fight against terrorist financing,"" said Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary Wysong.
""The message to industry from this guilty plea today is that the U.S. Government will bring its full power to bear in the investigation of those who conduct business with designated terrorist organizations, even when those acts occur outside of the United States,"" said ICE Special Agent in Charge Reid.
Chiquita's Payments to the AUC
Following the company's disclosure, the investigation leading to this prosecution developed evidence that for over six years from sometime in 1997 through Feb. 4, 2004 Chiquita paid money to the AUC in two regions of the Republic of Colombia where Chiquita had banana-producing operations: Urabá and Santa Marta. Chiquita made these payments through its wholly-owned Colombian subsidiary known as ""Banadex."" By 2003, Banadex was Chiquita's most profitable operation. Chiquita, through Banadex, paid the AUC nearly every month. In total, Chiquita made over 100 payments to the AUC amounting to over $1.7 million.
Chiquita began paying the AUC following a meeting in 1997 between the then-leader of the AUC, Carlos Castaño, and a senior executive of Banadex. Castaño implied that failure to make the payments could result in physical harm to Banadex personnel and property. No later than September 2000, Chiquita's senior executives knew that the corporation was paying the AUC and that the AUC was a violent, paramilitary organization led by Carlos Castaño. Chiquita's payments to the AUC were reviewed and approved by senior executives of the corporation, including high-ranking officers, directors and employees.
For several years Chiquita paid the AUC by check through various intermediaries. Chiquita recorded these payments in its corporate books and records as ""security payments"" or payments for ""security"" or ""security services."" Chiquita never received any actual security services in exchange for the payments.
Beginning in June 2002, Chiquita began paying the AUC in Santa Marta directly and in cash according to new procedures established by senior executives of Chiquita. The newly-implemented procedures concealed the fact that Chiquita was making direct cash payments to the AUC. A senior Chiquita officer had described these new procedures to Chiquita's Audit Committee on April 23, 2002.
Chiquita Continued to Pay the AUC After the AUC Was Designated as an FTO
The U.S. government designated the AUC as an FTO on Sept. 10, 2001, and that designation was well-publicized in the American public media. The AUC's designation was even more widely reported in the public media in Colombia, where Chiquita had its substantial banana-producing operations. Chiquita also had specific information about the AUC's designation as an FTO through an Internet-based, password-protected subscription service that Chiquita paid money to receive. Nevertheless, from Sept. 10, 2001 through Feb. 4, 2004, Chiquita made 50 payments to the AUC totaling over $825,000.
Chiquita Continued To Pay the AUC Against the Advice of Outside Counsel
On Feb. 20, 2003, a Chiquita employee told a senior Chiquita officer that he had discovered that the AUC had been designated by the U.S. government as an FTO. Shortly thereafter, these Chiquita officials spoke with attorneys in the District of Columbia office of a national law firm (""outside counsel"") about Chiquita's ongoing payments to the AUC. Beginning on Feb. 21, 2003, outside counsel emphatically advised Chiquita that the payments were illegal under United States law and that Chiquita should immediately stop paying the AUC directly or indirectly. Outside counsel advised Chiquita:
""Must stop payments.""
""Bottom Line: CANNOT MAKE THE PAYMENT""
""Advised NOT TO MAKE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT through CONVIVIR""
""General Rule: Cannot do indirectly what you cannot do directly""
Concluded with: ""CANNOT MAKE THE PAYMENT""
""You voluntarily put yourself in this position. Duress defense can wear out through repetition. Buz [business] decision to stay in harm's way. Chiquita should leave Colombia.""
""[T]he company should not continue to make the Santa Marta payments, given the AUC's designation as a foreign terrorist organization[.]""
""[T]he company should not make the payment.""
On April 3, 2003, a senior Chiquita officer and a member of Chiquita's Board of Directors first reported to the full Board that Chiquita was making payments to a designated FTO. A Board member objected to the payments and recommended that Chiquita consider taking immediate corrective action, including withdrawing from Colombia. The Board did not follow that recommendation, but instead agreed to disclose promptly to the Department of Justice the fact that Chiquita had been making payments to the AUC. Meanwhile, Banadex personnel were instructed to continue making the payments.
Chiquita Disclosed the Payments to the Department of Justice, but Continued to Make Them
On April 24, 2003, a senior Chiquita officer and a Chiquita Board member, along with outside counsel, disclosed to officials of the U.S. Department of Justice that Chiquita had been making payments to the AUC for years, and represented that the payments had been made under threat of violence. Department of Justice officials told the Chiquita representatives that the payments were illegal and could not continue. Department of Justice officials acknowledged that the issue of continued payments was complicated. On Sept. 8, 2003, outside counsel advised Chiquita in writing that: ""[Department of Justice] officials have been unwilling to give assurances or guarantees of non-prosecution. in fact, officials have repeatedly stated that they view the circumstances presented as a technical violation and cannot endorse current or future payments.""
Notwithstanding the persistent advice of its outside counsel, the Department of Justice's statement that the payments were illegal and could not continue, and Board involvement in the matter, Chiquita continued to pay the AUC throughout 2003 and early 2004. From April 24, 2003 (the date of Chiquita's initial disclosure to the Justice Department) through February 4, 2004, Chiquita made 20 payments to the AUC totaling over $300,000. Chiquita sold Banadex to a Colombian buyer in June 2004.
Chiquita has already provided the government with voluminous corporate records and made numerous company witnesses available for questioning in connection with this matter. As part of the plea agreement, Chiquita has committed to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation.
The plea agreement is the result of a joint investigation by the Department of Commerce and ICE. In announcing today's plea agreement, Assistant Attorney General Wainstein, U.S. Attorney Taylor, Deputy Assistant Secretary Wysong, and Special Agent in Charge Reid commended the concerted efforts of Commerce Special Agent Christopher Tafe and ICE Special Agent Theodore Schmitz. They praised Oliver John-Baptiste of the Litigation Support Unit, Paralegal Specialist Amber Wetzel, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jonathan M. Malis and Denise Cheung, and Department of Justice Trial Attorney Stephen Ponticiello, who are prosecuting the case. They also recognized the efforts of former Assistant U.S. Attorney John A. Beasley and Linda Otani McKinney, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeanne M. Hauch, and Department of Justice Trial Attorney Michael D. Taxay, all of whom worked on this matter at earlier stages.

Americans love beverages and all the choices they have. They also like the convenience of the plastic bottles that many beverages come in. What they don’t like is where a lot of these bottles end up.The nonalcoholic beverage industry produces about 100 billion plastic beverage bottles every year for U.S. consumers. About 30 billion of those bottles are recycled for reuse. The rest end up in a landfill or as litter. This is a waste of much-needed recyclable material that was designed to be repurposed.Our companies have sought to tackle this issue individually for years. Separately, we joined with sustainability groups to reduce our impacts on the environment. We’ve worked directly with community leaders to improve recycling systems. We’ve invested in the expansion of curbside and public recycling bins.Yet the problem of plastic bottles being in places they shouldn’t be has persisted. We realized the issue was bigger than any one company.We want the best for our customers in everything we doOurs is an extremely competitive industry. A glance at the creative ways we advertise the variety of choices on grocery shelves shows how we try to do our best every day to win customers from each other.In 2018, our three companies, and our trade association, the American Beverage Association, began work on a plan to improve the collection, recycling and reclaiming of our bottles. We believe that by harnessing together the power of our three companies,  we could reduce our reliance on new plastic and keep our plastic bottles out of the environment.Recently, we launched an industrywide effort with the country’s leading advocates for conservation and recycling to reduce our need for new plastic by working to collect, recycle and remake plastic bottles from the plastic bottles we already produce.Our bottles are already designed to be 100% recyclable so they can be remade into new bottles. The plastic we use in our bottles is used to make a variety of consumer products and is in high demand across many industries. All of us are eager to get the plastic back through improved recycling. When recycled appropriately, our bottles can be made into new bottles.A myth of a crisis:You shouldn't feel guilty about your plastic trashOur companies are committing $100 million to invest in upgrades to recycling infrastructure and education with Closed Loop Partners and The Recycling Partnership. These organizations will leverage our investment to generate nearly half a billion dollars in support for these programs. Through our combined investments, the organizations will zero in on targeted regions of the country where the best opportunities exist to drive increased collection of recyclable plastic, for use in new bottles.Our conservation planClosed Loop Partners, the leading investment firm in sustainability, will manage upgrades to recycling infrastructure and fund upgrades to equipment at material recovery systems with the latest optical scanners that can increase the amount of recycled plastic for reuse. The fund will also be used to help businesses that turn recycled bottles into plastic pellets for reuse in many products.The Recycling Partnership will conduct intensive educational and promotional efforts to expand the reach of recycling in communities and help educate residents on how to recycle better. They will work neighborhood by neighborhood to notify people about how to avoid contaminating recyclables.Finally, World Wildlife Fund will measure the success of this effort through their ReSource: Plastic initiative and help our companies use less new plastic. They will provide accountability and transparency that our industry is working to meet its commitments to protect and conserve the environment.You can't save the planet by going vegan:Corporate polluters must be held accountable.This is the first time these environmental and sustainability leaders will work together with an entire industry to address this urgent issue.On its own, Every Bottle Back is not going to solve the global problem of plastic in the environment. But for American beverage companies, this effort is demonstrative of what increased focus and collaboration can do. It’s our hope that Every Bottle Back becomes a catalyst for future investment and a model that can be replicated elsewhere. In demonstrating the value of our bottles, we hope to unlock the economic potential of all recyclable materials as a future resource for new packaging that can support our society and reduce our impact on the environment.Jim Dinkins is president of Coca-Cola North America, The Coca-Cola Co. Derek Hopkins is chief commercial officer of Keurig Dr Pepper.

The aluminium can industry has refuted recent claims by Coca-Cola that recycled PET bottles have a “much lower” carbon footprint than the aluminium can.
The Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI) says the carbon footprint of both containers is “comparable”, and the aluminium can performs “significantly better” than the plastic PET bottle on critical sustainability metrics, including recycling rate, recycled content and economic value.
The statement comes after Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey’s said the recycled PET bottle has a “much lower” carbon footprint than the aluminium can.
“A recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottle has a much lower carbon footprint than an aluminium can or a returned glass bottle,” Quincey told Reuters news agency.
In response, the CMI released a statement saying aluminium beverage cans are the “most recycled drinks package in the world”.
Most all recycled cans being transformed into new cans has a positive environmental impact. When an aluminium can is produced from recyclable material, it saves more than 90% of the energy used
“The average aluminium can in the United States has a recycled content of 73%,” said CMI President Robert Budway. “This is significantly higher than plastic PET bottles in the United States, which have less than 10% recycled content.
“Most all recycled cans being transformed into new cans has a positive environmental impact. When an aluminium can is produced from recyclable material, it saves more than 90% of the energy used and greenhouse gas emissions produced in comparison to making that same aluminium can from virgin material.”
In the US, the recycling rate for the aluminium beverage can is 50%, whereas the recycling rate for the PET bottle is 26%, according to CMI.
The recycling rate for aluminium cans is high in other parts of the world, including Europe (75%).
The CMI says the aluminium can also has a high economic value. A recent two-year average shows in the scrap market aluminium cans are worth more than four times PET bottles in the US.
Budway added: “This high economic value means recyclers want the aluminium cans back so they can get desperately needed revenue to support the rest of the recycling system.  In other words, aluminium cans help support the recycling of many other less economically viable materials.”
“All these metrics together mean the beverage can is the only container that consumers can recycle with the confidence that their package will actually be recycled into a new, recyclable product and that their action will have a significant environmental impact,” Budway stated.
“The can’s advantage in these metrics also mean the aluminium can is the container that can most help brands meet their ambitious sustainability goals including higher recycled content and increased recycling rates for their beverage packaging.”"ÿÿCan industry refutes Coca-Cola’s claim that recycled bottles have lower carbon footprint

    Coca-Cola Sweden has announced that, from 2020, it will make all its plastic bottles from 100% recycled material – becoming the first country in the world to do so.  The transition will begin in the first quarter of 2020 and includes all plastic (PET) packaging made at Coca-Cola’s bottling plant in Jordbro.

By switching to 100% recycled material in its bottles, Coca-Cola seeks to eliminate the use of 3,500 tons of virgin plastic each year in Sweden. This will also reportedly result in an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of 25 percent over pre-transition levels when the portfolio comprised approximately 40 percent recovered PET.

The move to 100 percent recycled plastics for PET bottles includes the brands Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite as well as Bonaqua, comprising 40 different variants.“Plastic is an effective and valuable packaging material and we need to treat it as such, ensuring that nothing goes to waste.  Coca-Cola Sweden wants to lead the development of a circular economy where all packages are collected so that they can be used again.” says Sofie Eliasson Morsink, General Manager for Coca-Cola European Partners Sverige. ""Coca-Cola has set out global goals to work towards a world without packaging waste, which includes the goal to recover a bottle or can for everyone that they sell by 2030, and local markets are encouraged to go further and faster wherever they can. In collaboration with local and national partners, as well as through its brand communications, Coca-Cola Sweden wants to encourage all consumers to return all packaging so none of them end up as litter in nature by mistake.""

""Sweden is at the forefront in several areas associated with packaging and sustainability. Our deposit and return system, Returpack, is among the best in the world, which is instrumental to our making this transition now. As a large industry player, we have a responsibility to contribute to a circular economy within the beverage industry"", continues Sofie Eliasson Morsink.

Colgate is now adapting its factories to manufacture the tube so as to meet its goal of selling only recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025. “We are encouraging the industry and retailers to move forward on this as quickly as possible. If you stop to think about it, it makes no sense if we have the only recyclable tube out there,” said Ann Tracy, vice president of safety, sustainability and supply chain strategy at Colgate, in an interview. The tube, recognized by the Association of Plastic Recyclers, is made of high-density polyethylene, or HDPE, which is a recyclable plastic that Colgate’s engineers were able to make less rigid. Most toothpaste tubes are unrecyclable because they are made from sheets of plastic laminate and a layer of aluminum pressed together in a film.

Read: Coffee drinkers have to stop double cupping their Dunkin’ — yes, even in New England As many as 20 billion toothpaste tubes are made every year, according to Colgate, and as the world’s top toothpaste maker by market share, the company is a major contributor to what ends up in the landfill. Colgate reported in June to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that it had a plastic packaging volume of 287,008 metric tons last year. Plastic can take up to a millennia to decompose. Concerns remain that recycling can tackle plastic pollution due to a lack of infrastructure as environmentalists push for companies to stop using plastic altogether. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated in 2017 that only 8.4% of plastic waste was recycled. Colgate is working with industry players to build up recycling infrastructure and expects more to be in place by the time the company reaches its 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging goal by 2025, Tracy said. “It’s not going to happen overnight,” she said. On the other hand, some newer toothpaste designers have avoided plastic. Bite, a toothpaste maker that is sold online, markets its products as plastic-free since it is contained in more easily recycled glass jars with an aluminum cap. Tracy said Colgate is exploring alternative materials, such as plastic made from biomaterials and fiber, but cautioned that glass can cause more greenhouse gas emissions than plastic when transported on a truck since it is heavier. “You need to think of the whole picture,” she said.  Don’t miss: Fast shipping isn’t great for the environment— 7 ways to cut the carbon footprint on your Amazon deliveries Still, many environmentalists remain unconvinced of the promise of recyclable plastic and advocate for companies to ditch throwaway packaging entirely. “Until Colgate and other corporations move toward systems of reuse and package-free options, we will continue to see their packaging polluting our oceans, waterways and communities,” said Kate Melges, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace USA, in a statement. This year, the Break Free From Plastic coalition, which Greenpeace is part of, named Colgate among the top 10 plastic polluters in the world for the second year in a row, following its review of litter that volunteers collected. Tracy acknowledged the plastic pollution that Colgate contributes to, but said the company’s latest actions show its pledge to solve the issue. “We know that this is part of the ecosystem to get pushed in that direction, but we don’t need them to push us. We are taking our own steps,” she said. Colgate shares are up 12.9% in the year to date.

Billionaire Iskandar Safa says a former Credit Suisse banker accused him falsely in testimony given to a New York court. This is but the latest development in the scandal involving loans to Mozambique.
The scandal about the billions granted to companies in the southern African nation knows no end: Iskandar Safa, one of the businessmen behind Privinvest Group, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm, accused a former Credit Suisse banker of having lied in his testimony to a New York court last month, according to a report by «Bloomberg».
Andrew Pearse, an ex-managing director at Credit Suisse, in July pleaded guilty of having accepted kickbacks. Privinvest staff «wired me millions of dollars in unlawful kickbacks from loan proceeds and illegal payments for my assistance in securing loans by Credit Suisse,» Pearse had admitted in court. The money granted to the companies in Mozambique was intended for a tuna-fishing fleet, patrol boats and a shipyard.
Second to Plead Guilty
The accusations levelled at Privinvest were false, according to a statement released by the spokesman for Safa, «Bloomberg» reported on Thursday. Safa also claims that Pearse wasn't as influential for the deal as he claimed.
Pearse was the second ex-Credit Suisse banker to plead guilty. Detelina Subeva, also an ex-manager of the Swiss bank, in May admitted having received $200,000 for laundering kickbacks."ÿÿEx-Credit Suisse Banker Accused of Lying

Three former Credit Suisse bankers have been arrested in London on US charges of alleged involvement in a fraud involving $2bn (£1.6bn) in loans to state-owned companies in Mozambique.
Mozambique’s former finance minister, Manuel Chang, and a senior executive from the shipbuilder Privinvest Group, Jean Boustani, have also been arrested in South Africa and New York, respectively, in recent days.
The action by US authorities came two months after the Serious Fraud Office in the UK abandoned its investigation into the case, a long-running loan scandal that pushed Mozambique into financial crisis when it first emerged five years ago.
The US is seeking to charge the former bankers in connection with conspiracy to violate anti-bribery laws, money laundering and securities fraud.
It is alleged Chang allowed secret loans, ostensibly for maritime investments, into Mozambique without the authority of the government or parliament. The men arrested on Thursday in London were named as Andrew Pearse, Surjan Singh and Detelina Subeva, who were arrested in connection with allegations of defrauding investors.
US prosecutors allege the former Credit Suisse bankers intentionally circumvented antifraud measures set in place by their employer between 2011 and 2013 in order to set up and execute the fraud, while using personal emails to conceal their involvement.
The international scam caused the International Monetary Fund to suspend its assistance to Mozambique, leading to a crash in the country’s economy.
Pearse, Singh and Subeva have been released on bail pending extradition proceedings by the US authorities. If they and others are convicted of violating US anti-bribery provisions they could face fines of up to $100,000 or a five-year prison sentence per violation, in addition to up to 20 years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to $500,000 for money laundering.
In a press release, a spokesperson for Credit Suisse confirmed the involvement of three former Credit Suisse staff: “The indictment alleges that the former employees worked to defeat the bank’s internal controls, acted out of a motive of personal profit, and sought to hide these activities from the bank.”
Confirming no charges have been brought against the bank the spokesperson added: “Credit Suisse will continue to cooperate with relevant regulators following these indictments, and separately looks forward to continuing to work with the relevant authorities to move forward with the proposed debt restructuring.”
Tim Jones, policy officer at the global debt monitor Jubilee Debt Campaign, attacked the UK’s lack of action and said Mozambique should not be expected to repay the loan. “It is scandalous that it has required action from the US authorities for this investigation and arrests to be made in London.
He said: “Credit Suisse should immediately drop its debt claim against the Mozambique people, and call on other owners of the debt to do the same. They should pursue the money from the individuals and banks responsible, not the people of Mozambique.”
He added: “The Mozambique people should not have to repay one cent on a debt they had no say over and no benefit from.”
Omar Remane, from the diplomatic and economic affairs department at the Mozambique high commission in London, confirmed to the Guardian last week that “negotiations in London between the government of Mozambique and its creditors has led to an agreement in principle over 60% of the debt” and that further discussions were under way, an indication that the country would still have to repay its creditors despite the international fraud investigation."ÿÿEx-Credit Suisse bankers arrested in $2bn fraud investigation

A non-governmental organization is lodging a criminal complaint against Credit Suisse over million-dollar tuna bonds in Mozambique. The Swiss bank denies knowing of any wrong-doing in the scandal.
The Swiss bank's link to a corruption scandal in Mozambique just got more unpleasant: Swiss non-governmental organization Public Eye is filing a criminal complaint against Credit Suisse with Switzerland's attorney general, it said in a statement on Monday. The move follows a lawsuit filed by the south African nation against the Zurich-based bank last month.
The Swiss complaint is awkward for Credit Suisse, which has sought to downplay its ties to the oil- and gas-rich eastern African nation. The country defaulted last year, after it surfaced that some funds intended for infrastructure like tuna-fishing boats allegedly went towards military equipment instead. Credit Suisse and VTB had emitted bonds with a coupon of 8.5 percent for parts of the loans granted to Mozambique, but not told investors it granted further loans to the impoverished country.
Public Eye said it wants Switzerland's attorney general to clarify whether Credit Suisse adequately supervised its subsidiary, which issued the bonds, and fulfilled its duties to combat illegal activity. Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner said the Swiss bank didn't know of any wrong-doing by former employees, when he was asked about the scandal at the Swiss bank's shareholder meeting on Friday."ÿÿCredit Suisse Hit With Criminal Complaint Over Mozambique

					We live in Melbourne, Australia where the ozone layer is particularly thin. So for us, sunscreen is not only nice to have, it’s an essential body care product. But it’s always been a struggle to find truly sustainable vegan sunscreen alternatives.Finding sunscreen that is healthy for you and the environment (especially the reefs!) can be tricky. Every drug store option that we’ve looked at is unhealthy in some way, shape or form.However, it’s now more important than ever that we use an environmentally friendly option. Especially if you’re planning on taking a dip in the ocean.Thankfully, after spending hours researching, we’ve managed to source nine vegan sunscreen alternatives that do the job.But before we get into the details, how do you know if a product (specifically sunscreen) is vegan friendly?
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					VEGAN SUNSCREEN OR NO VEGAN SUNSCREEN?
				
				
				
				
					For starters, a vegan certification is the easiest way to tell. Though, many small-batch artisan brands may not be accredited but are in fact vegan friendly. In fact, many of the brands we’ve listed below fall in this category.If you’re relying on the word of the brand (without a certification), here’s a list of the most common animal byproducts / animal ingredients that are used in a lot of mainstream sunscreen formulations to look out for:lanolin – the not so sexy excretion from sheep’s wool (also found in a lot of cosmetic products like lipsticks and makeup removers)chitin – crushed exoskeletons or shells of crustaceans (e.g. crabs, shrimps, prawns), insects and arachnidsgelatin – a variety of boiled animal parts from skin to ligaments to bonescollagen – this one is quite well known and widely used in all sorts of cosmetic products. It’s the naturally occurring protein found in animal tissue. Usually taken from the fat of cows, pigs and sheepelastin – another protein, usually found and extracted from the neck ligaments and aortas of cowsstearic acid – the naturally waxy solid usually derived from animal fat but can also be derived from vegetable oils
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					OCEAN FRIENDLY VEGAN SUNSCREEN: WHY THIS IS A REEF’S BEST FRIEND
				
				
				
				
					Besides ticking the non-negotiable cruelty-free and vegan boxes, why is an environmentally friendly sunscreen so important?Let’s start with the numbers. The U.S. National Park Service estimates that between 4,000 to 6,000 tons of sunscreen enters the ocean (specifically reefs) every year. Coral reefs are also said to be the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the world. That’s a LOT of sunscreen to say the least. But more specifically, a LOT of toxic ingredients.Many of these products contain synthetic organic molecules which have now been found in a variety of marine animals including fish, dolphins, and birds. While the full implications of this are not yet understood there is evidence that shows the molecules affect the fertility and reproduction of fish.There’s also been a recent study which shows evidence that the commonly found ingredient known as oxybenzone causes endocrine disruption. DNA damage and death of coral, among other issues. It’s also been shown to exacerbate and accelerate the devastating coral bleaching. This is destroying much of the fragile coral reef ecosystems around the world.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					AND THEN THERE’S NANO PARTICLES…
				
				
				
				
					Besides oxybenzone, you should also be aware of nano zinc-oxide and nano titanium dioxide.Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide have actually been used for decades in sunscreen to reflect or absorb UV light. You can tell by that white shade which never seems to absorb into your skin. This was the case back in the day because of the size of these old-school particles.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
				
					Nowadays these ingredients are manufactured on a “nano-scale”. Which means they absorb and scatter visible light making them transparent.Aside from the concerns of nano particles in general (evidence shows these particles can pass the skin barrier) research suggests nano zinc-oxide and nano titanium-dioxide may cause cytotoxicity. And also produce free radicals, ultimately increasing the risk of skin cancer.While the jury is still out on whether or not there is a real danger in being exposed to these molecules, the EU and New Zealand have both followed the precautionary principle (i.e. avoiding certain decisions that may lead to harm). They require nano materials in cosmetics to go through nano-specific safety testing before they can be sold, and / or to be listed on cosmetic product labels.
				
				
				
				
																
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
				
					When we first started investigating vegan sunscreen options we realized we didn’t have much knowledge on the commonly used jargon. So, we thought we’d define some of these terms to help you understand the lingo a little better!UVA and UVB: The sun actually emits three types of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, UVA, UVB and UVC. However, only UVA and UVB reaches our skin. UVC is absorbed by the earth’s ozone layer. Both UVA and UVB have different wavelengths and are not visible to the naked eye. Having said that, they both damage unprotected skin.UVA is responsible for about 95% of the UV radiation that our skin is exposed to. You also can’t escape it, it’s present on sunny and cloudy days. While you won’t necessarily feel this ultraviolet light as it gives you that warm slow tan, don’t be fooled! It’s the leading cause or major contributor of all types of skin cancer, wrinkles, and it penetrates glass (unless specially treated).On the ultraviolet side, UVB is a powerful UV light and is responsible for sunburn as it tends to damage the superficial epidermal layers. It’s also responsible for other abnormalities in the skin like discoloration. UVB is more present in sunnier conditions and is reflected by water, sand and snow.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
				
					We couldn’t write an article about vegan sunscreens without looking at SPF (albeit briefly) could we!Most people are familiar with SPF or “sun protection factor”. It’s the measurement of how long a sunscreen or sunblock will protect your skin against ultraviolet light for. Because of the strength of UVA and UVB rays changes throughout the day it’s impossible to know how long an SPF will last for.It’s also important to note that no SPF factor is 100% safe. A higher SPF is, of course, better but sun protection should just be one of your sun safe strategies.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					VEGAN SUNSCREEN FOR DARK SKIN TONES
				
				
				
				
					While we’re on the subject of the dangers of sun exposure – for those with natural dark or brown skin tones listen up. It’s a great look but it doesn’t guarantee that you’re sun safe. In fact, you’re not much better off than those with pale skin when it comes to the risks of skin cancer.  Everyone should wear a broad spectrum sunscreen to protect against the cumulative effects of sun exposure. Especially those of us who live a very outdoors life (under cloudy or sunny skies).
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
				
					Broad spectrum is usually referred to when describing sunscreen. The term simply means that the product protects against both types of ultraviolet light that reaches our skin – UVA and UVB. So it’s always preferable to go for an option that covers both as more often than not, UVA and UVB will be lurking around outside!
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
				
					If this is your first time visiting Sustainable Jungle, our approach to sunscreen and body care products in general is to look for brands and products that are:vegancruelty freeorganic / naturalpalm oil freehave ethical ingredient sourcing policies anduse thoughtful, ideally zero-waste packaging (meaning it either has no waste at all, or waste that is compostable or widely reusable).Some of the sunscreen options below are not always available in every country. We’ll continue to research and add any other vegan sunscreen that protects skin (with adequate SPF) from sun exposure to the list. Reach out and let us know if you know of any others that should be featured!

It’s no secret that big brand beauty is good at concealing some less than sustainable practices: animal testing and cruelty, totally unnecessary animal-products, and all other manner of unethically obtained beauty ingredients.

It’s time we expose the ugly pimples underneath and turn toward more ethical, vegan concealer options to cover up those unwanted blemishes instead.

In this search for the best cruelty free concealer options, we tried to cover all our bases by looking for products that adhere to our sustainable beauty criteria. While we obviously want products that are vegan and cruelty-free, we also look for products that are  organic / natural, palm oil free, have ethical ingredient sourcing policies and use thoughtful packaging.  We’re not exactly focusing on zero waste here, but in general we try to prioritize brands with either zero waste or recycle packaging to minimize waste as much as possible.

While we don’t always get full coverage for these criteria, we try to get as flawless as possible.

					Hi! Looking for a vegan and cruelty free deodorant that actually works?The cruelty free and vegan market has exploded with options in the last few years which is great. The problem though, is trying to find cruelty-free deodorants that are effective. So, we’ve made a list of our favorites that we can safely say are fit for purpose!We’ve also made sure these options are al naturale (in all senses of the word). So, we not only look after our furry friends but also ourselves (and the environment).
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					ALUMINUM AND WHY IT HAS NO PLACE IN CRUELTY-FREE DEODORANTS
				
				
				
				
					This additive has got a lot of bad press over the last few years.Heaps of off the shelf anti-perspirant deodorants use aluminum. It’s used to prevent sweating. It does this by literally plugging the ducts on our skin’s surface. Which prevents a clammy under arm and the spread of odor causing bacteria.This would be a great solution if it wasn’t totally unnatural. Unfortunately, we are mammals and that mean’s we sweat. It’s how we stay cool and eliminate toxins. Which is why aluminum is definitely not the answer.Recent studies have shown that once absorbed, aluminum induces estrogen-like effects which may be increase or be the cause of breast cancer.  The jury is still out on whether this is conclusive, however, it goes without saying that it’s probably best to avoid exposing ourselves until more research is done.But it’s also not just aluminum that’s the problem.There are a host of other synthetic, chemical and other noxious chemicals (e.g. sulphates, phthalates and parabens which are known to affect hormone function among other negative effects) found in almost every single off the shelf deodorant.That’s why we always opt for a truly natural cruelty-free deodorant alternative. They’re healthier and less damaging to the environment.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					INGREDIENTS YOU SHOULD AVOID IN A CRUELTY-FREE DEODORANT
				
				
				
				
					As a rule of thumb, if you can’t quickly understand the ingredients in the natural cruelty-free deodorant then our advice would be to steer clear. If there’s aluminum, parabens, synthetics, phthalates, sulphates and any other ingredients containing the likes of “poly”, “-eth-” or “oxy” then it’s not a truly eco friendly deodorant.Look out for the following animal ingredients to ensure it’s a vegan friendly deodorant:lanolin – also found in a lot of cosmetic products like lipsticks and makeup removerschitin – crushed exoskeletons or shells of crustaceans (e.g. crabs, shrimps, prawns), insects and arachnidsgelatin – a variety of boiled animal parts from skin to ligaments to bonescollagen – widely used in all sorts of cosmetic products. The naturally occurring protein found in animal tissue.elastin – another protein, usually found and extracted from the neck ligamentsstearic acid – the naturally waxy solid usually derived from animal fat but can also be derived from vegetable oilsAlso, the list of ingredients should ideally be short and to the point. We don’t need 30+ cheap additives.Apart from the formulation of the cruelty free vegan deodorant, it should be as zero waste as possible. Plastic free deodorant is really the future so the packaging should be compostable, re-usable and at the very least recyclable. Have a read here for a list of specific zero waste deodorant options, many of which are also cruelty free and vegan friendly.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					CRITERIA FOR VEGAN CRUELTY-FREE DEODORANTS
				
				
				
				
					If this is your first time visiting Sustainable Jungle, our approach to sustainable beauty is to look for brands and products that are:vegancruelty-freeorganic / naturalpalm oil freehave ethical ingredient sourcing policies anduse thoughtful, zero-waste packaging (meaning it either has no waste at all, or waste that is compostable or widely reusable).We know that’s a tall order and it takes a fair bit of time to find these brands! While we can’t always get every box ticked, this list prioritizes cruelty free and vegan friendly products.

And many are available or even based in the UK!In fact, according to this report,the global vegan cosmetics market is set to reach $20.8 billion by 2025 – great to know the trend is going in the right direction!The problem though, is trying to find vegan brands that are also truly ethical and sustainable. That is, they make eco friendly makeup in all senses of the phrase!You can spend literally hours researching which eco friendly makeup brands are not only good for you but also for the environment. That’s why we’re always on the lookout for the best brands that meet each of our sustainable beauty criteria.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					ECO FRIENDLY MAKEUP BRANDS: THE DETAILS…
				
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					BEFORE WE START… CONSIDER REUSABLE COTTON OR BAMBOO ROUNDS

					Cotton pads or cotton balls are a makeup staple. We all use them. But, these little unassuming aids are not all that benign.They are one of the major contributors to makeup waste. There are millions upon millions of these cotton pads tossed in the landfill every single month. But, it’s not just the waste generated it’s the environmental impact of growing cotton.Pollution, soil degradation, water contamination are just some of the examples of the impact this crop has on the surrounding areas.That’s why its super environmentally helpful to buy some reusable cotton rounds or reusable cotton pads. They’re easy to use and clean, they’ll last you an age and you’ll be saving on mountains of plastic packaging and single use waste!You can pick up some beautiful options on Etsy too (including made from bamboo, cotton, hemp)If you are considering compostable or biodegradable makeup wipes as another alternative be extra sure that they are indeed compostable and then actually compost them…There’s a lot of marketing these days, and often when a product says it’s biodegradable or compostable it may just mean that on an industrial scale. I.e. it won’t just break down in your composter at home (or worm farm) or worse, it basically won’t break down at all.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					…AND ECO FRIENDLY MAKEUP BRUSHES

					Another important makeup tool is the trusty makeup brush.While looking for eco friendly and sustainable makeup brands to support, why not make sure (next time you need one) you get an eco friendly makeup brush to boot? I, (somewhat sadly) have an old set of makeup brushes that still work perfectly well so can’t quite justify getting a new set but wow, if I did, there is so much choice these days! There are a fair few brands on the market now that make sustainable, plastic free and environmentally friendly options using renewable sources like bamboo. EcoTools, the Peta-certified brush company is a good example or check out Inika for vegan, cruelty free and organic brushes.

					About Fat and the Moon MakeupFat and the Moon offer a HUGE selection of eco friendly makeup and personal care products.As for their sustainable make-up, or their “adornment” collection, they focus on lip and eye products, including various colors of “eye coal” (which is pretty much like eyeliner but less waxy and in pot form) and several tinted, lip/cheek stains and highlighter.
				
				
				
				
					About Fat and the MoonDrawing inspiration from herbalists and natural healers, Fat and the Moon creates all natural, mostly organic (and they’re very clear about noting which items are organic on each product page) “potions” that prioritize healing and “empowerment through self-care”.All products are hand-made fresh to order (because “body products, like food, are not meant to last forever!”) using only “plants that are abundant, ethically harvested and organically cultivated and combine them in formulations that are radically non-toxic”.All Fat and the Moon products are palm oil freeDepending on your stance on the whole Is beeswax vegan? debate, not all their products may be considered vegan friendly.Their eye coals and lip stains contain beeswax, but their highligher does not. Either way, all ingredients are cruelty-free and ethically sourced and every single product comes in reusable tins and are shipped without superfluous packaging.Their packaging is also re-usable, and they “encourage customers to find fun and creative ways of reusing our jars. We design packaging to be a joy to reuse and a breeze to recycle.”Fat and the Moon is a women owned and run business. They also support various charities and causes in their community.“We should take as much care selecting the things we put on our bodies as we do in shopping for the foods we put in them,” says founder Rachel Budde. “The goal of Fat and the Moon is to make that a pleasure!”

Just refill your palate then wet the pouch and plant it in your garden to grow herbs and wildflowers. Such a great concept!They also offset all their emissions with Bullfrog Power and give back to multiple local and women’s-based charities, like the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (they sponsor three elephants named Maisha, Dololo, and Larr – which we love!).

This is the gold standard certification in the UK and the standards are some of the strictest in the world. To gain certification, 95% of your ingredients must be truly organic, which means (among many other strict criteria), that they come from a sustainable farming system.While Odylique may not be accredited with any vegan associations because a few products in their range contain honey and beeswax, they are otherwise completely vegan.

					*Note: Not all Lush products are vegan, however there are vegan makeup options
				
				
				
				
					Lush’s Makeup Range: Lush’s range is somewhat limited as they’re not only a makeup brand.They have concealers, blush, foundation, highlighters, skin tint, blush and in some countries, mascara and eyeliner.Lush’s products are completely vegetarian but not all are vegan so be sure to check the ingredients first. They do have a way of quickly filtering on the website for vegan friendly products.
				
				
				
				
					About LushLush offers a variety of fresh, handmade personal care products, including perfumes, deodorants, soaps, make-up, sunscreens, even Henna hair dyes. Their products are vegetarian (and many are vegan) and cruelty-free. They only purchase ingredients from suppliers who are also cruelty-free and do not participate in animal testing.Lush products are not palm oil free (read more here) or entirely natural, as many of them do contain the sulfate SLS (read more here).  For us, the palm oil thing is a deal breaker (see our thoughts here, here and here) and we choose not to use Lush for this reason.However, Lush does seem to be putting in a tremendous amount of effort to do the right thing and we appreciate their transparency. If you’re considering using Lush, do read up on them and make your own decision based on your ethical priorities.Happily, Lush have a very clear policy on their ethical sourcing (read more here) which we don’t often see so clearly articulated. Lush are doing a great job on the packaging front. For creams, bottles, lipstick tubes, and the like, Lush uses a simple black plastic pot, a simple, no-frills packaging that “ensures customers pay for the ingredients inside their product, not the distractions on the outside”.These Lush black pots can supposedly “have more lives than a cat”, made from BPA-free mixed polypropylene (PP) that can be reused again and again.  Because PP plastics are harder to recycle, Lush will do it for you at an in-house recycling center where old pots are chipped, washed, melted, and remolded before refill. As a thanks for returning your pots and reducing plastic waste, they’ll send you a free face mask.Gift boxes and tags are made of recycled cocoon paper and cardboard that can later be composted.  Delicate items that require some padding are wrapped in biodegradable cellulose that can actually be composted! They also provide clear guidelines on how to recycle all their products.
				
				
				
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					FINAL THOUGHTS ON SUSTAINABLE MAKEUP BRANDS
				
				
				
				
					Synthetic ingredients , cheap fillers and additives. It’s a wonder that the whole consumer base hasn’t already jumped ship from the conventional to eco friendly makeup brands.Beauty is and should be all natural and have as little negative impact as possible. So if you do need to buy, buy intentionally!Elate Cosmetics sums it up quite nicely: “Intentional, purposeful, ritual. For many of us, putting on makeup is an automatic act, a routine. […w]e believe everyday routine becomes ritual when the action is more meaningful than the outcome.”Also remember, if you’re looking to reduce the plastic packaging in your life, then check out our Zero Waste Makeup Article for some great brands doing special things.We hope this article has given you some food for thought on ethical makeup brands. Who says you can’t spend Saturday night out on the town and still be sustainable?!As always, please reach out for questions, suggestions, or comments.

					APPROACH TO VEGAN, CRUELTY-FREE MOISTURIZERS
				
				
				
				
					If this is your first time visiting, our approach to sustainable beauty is to look for brands and products that are:vegancruelty-freeorganic / naturalpalm oil freehave ethical ingredient sourcing policies anduse thoughtful, (ideally) zero waste/compostable packagingWe know it’s tall order and believe us, it takes a fair bit of time to find these brands to meet all or most criteria.While we hope to provide a useful resource for you, we would also love to hear your thoughts and suggestions if we missed anything or if you have any experience with these brands, as we have not had the chance to try them all…yet.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					BEST VEGAN, CRUELTY FREE MOISTURIZER FOR SENSITIVE SKIN
				
				
				
				
					If your skin is prone to redness, irritation, itchiness, tenderness or is just generally sensitive, it’s often a sign of an underlying condition, like eczema, rosacea or using a product that strips the skin’s natural oils.To give your skin the best chance of recovery, it’s best to use a natural and nourishing cruelty-free moisturizer (without fragrances, which can often irritate sensitive skin).We’d recommend Good Juju Herbal Skin Food. Their moisturizers are made in small batches with no preservatives using ingredients that are plant-based, food-grade, organic and locally sourced when possible.Alternatively Booda Butter also make a USDA Certified Organic daily moisturizer, which we’ve tried and love! For more info on both these options have a read of our list below.Of course, if your symptoms are severe then we’d definitely recommend a visit to a dermatologist.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					BEST VEGAN, CRUELTY FREE MOISTURIZER FOR MATURE OR DRY SKIN
				
				
				
				
					The Answer is Ethique. This brand hails from New Zealand. We absolutely love them. Not just because they’re zero waste but also because their products are really effective.And for those with mature skin or just naturally dry skin, they’ve got the perfect solution – The Perfector. It’s specifically branded as the Dreamy Cruelty-Free Face Moisturizer for Dry to Mature Skin but we’ve used it all over. It’s made with coconut oil, kokum and cupuacu butters (both of which have substantial essential fatty acids).For more info on Ethique, scroll down the list!
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					BEST VEGAN, CRUELTY FREE MOISTURIZER WITH SPF
				
				
				
				
					A cruelty free moisturizer with SPF is a huge time saver so you don’t have to apply sunscreen (and moisturizer)!If you spend time outdoors, work outdoors or just live in a sun rich country like we do – Australia  this is a beauty hack that more people should get onto.We’d recommend either Acure’s Radically Rejuvenating SPF Day Cream with an SPF of 30 (a crueltyfree, vegan, palm oil free option).For dedicated vegan cruelty-free vegan sunscreen options check out our article: Cruelty Free, Sustainable & Vegan Sunscreen: Saving Your Skin and the Planet One Tan at a Time. For those who love a swim in the sea, there’s some reef friendly products just for you.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					BEST ORGANIC FACE MOISTURIZER
				
				
				
				
					Since starting Sustainable Jungle back in mid 2017, we’ve tested a LOT of different ethical cosmetics and creams (and everything in between).On this specific list, we’ve tried multiple products from each brand except Fat and the Moon and Good Juju Herbal. Both of which we’ve heard excellent things! So, if we had to pick the best organic face moisturizer it would have to be (in no particular order):Dirt Hippie Cosmetics Organic Vegan Moisturizer. There are 3 different formulations to choose from depending on your skin type (oily and acne prone skin, dry and combination skin types and mature and sensitive skin types). We’re currently using the dry and combination skin types. It’s light yet moisturizing enough for a winter – this is our go-to at the moment as we live in Australia and can buy it locally. MuLondon Fragrance Free Moisturizer. We preferred no scent but others may want to try the variety of options (hullo white chocolate truffle!) .

					About Earth Tu FaceEarth Tu Face was created in 2010 by Sarah Buscho and Marina Storm “in a California kitchen and herbal garden”. They are a 100% natural skincare line, free of toxins and synthetic compounds. Earth Tu Face Products are all cruelty-free, palm oil (and derivative) free and are made from organic, wild-harvested ingredients, some of which come from their own garden.All their products are vegan (including the face serum on this list) except for their Skin Stick, Face Balm, Honey Mask, Vanilla Peppermint Lip Balm, and Botanical Perfumes. These are the products that contain honey and/or beeswax.Their packaging is made mostly from reusable/recyclable glass (here’s a nice article they wrote about ways to reuse their packaging) and a some of their products come in compostable card. For Zero Wasters, Earth Tu Face offer refills of handmade products upon request. They are also working on having a refillable option for every product in the line so watch this space.For shipping, their third party fulfillment center is woman-owned and reuses packaging like peanuts and bubble wrap that comes to them with other shipments. For us, the most impressive thing about Earth Tu Face is their approach to Ethical Sourcing, this is what they had to say: “Sustainability is an integral part of Earth Tu Face. When we formulate, we always take plant populations and farming practices into account. We will not bring a product into the world that threatens habitats or the environment. We don’t see any upside in doing so. Ensuring ethical sourcing takes research, in-depth calls with suppliers, and in some cases in-person visits. High quality ingredients and ethical sourcing also comes at a higher expense, and can alienate some customers who cannot afford or do not want to pay the price of products made to these standards. However, it’s more important to us to create ethical products we can proudly stand behind. We are a tiny company made up of 4 women, and so there is nowhere for our values to get lost down the supply chain or chain of command. We all fiercely believe in making the best choices for the environment and for ourselves — because there really is no separation between the two. We took a great deal of care choosing our sources when we began in 2010 and we’ve continued to use those sources and find others that meet our standards.“And of course, this Face Serum looks simply delicious! Key ingredients are Blue Chamomile (for reducing inflammation and irritation) and Carrot Seed Oil (with cell-rejuvenating compounds). We’re excited to give this one a go!

Published 8:31 p.m. ET April 15, 2014 | Updated 8:47 a.m. ET April 16, 2014
Foreign legal systems and American lawyers cheat big business
A few years ago, the corruption convictions of several prominent plaintiffs' lawyers put a spotlight on dishonesty in American civil courts. Now the sleaze has burst back into the news with cases involving Chevron and Dole Food Co., this time with an international twist.
Last month, a federal court in Manhattan found that a U.S. plaintiffs' lawyer had masterminded a multibillion dollar fraud and extortion scheme against Chevron in Ecuador. Three days later, a California appellate court affirmed the dismissal of a lawsuit against Dole as a ""fraud on the court"" perpetrated by U.S. and Nicaraguan plaintiffs' lawyers.
These rulings are welcome news not only for the companies involved, but also to anyone who cares about justice and the reliability of our legal system.
Bribery abroad
The U.S. lawyer behind the Chevron case, Steven Donziger, and his co-conspirators obtained a $19 billion judgment against the company in Ecuador based on false allegations of environmental contamination, while simultaneously mounting a relentless public pressure campaign hoping to embarrass the company into capitulating. Rather than settle, Chevron went on the offensive.
Following a seven-week trial last fall, a federal court has now confirmed the fraud, bribery and extortion at the core of the case and it has found that Donziger committed numerous violations of federal racketeering laws.
The opinion detailed how he and his team ghost-wrote a court-appointed expert's report after secret payments to the expert. The court also found that Donziger and his affiliates bribed an Ecuadorean judge to let them write the $19 billion judgment against Chevron themselves.
Hollywood plot
The federal judge was so disturbed that he has ordered Donziger and the plaintiffs to pay Chevron anything they might win in foreign courts. The U.S. court described the scheme, which included clandestine meetings and a secret bank account, as including ""things that normally come only out of Hollywood.""
The Dole litigation involved false allegations that the company had caused sterility of tens of thousands of banana workers in Nicaragua by exposing them to pesticides in the late 1970s. In 2007, a Los Angeles jury returned a multimillion dollar verdict in the first of potentially thousands of trials against Dole. But then Dole turned the tables.
Justice at home
After an international investigation by Dole, California courts found the litigation to be a ""heinous conspiracy"" orchestrated by lawyers in the U.S. and Nicaragua who recruited fake plaintiffs, coached them to lie, forged documents, falsified lab results and threatened witnesses. One of the ""sterile"" victims fathered three children, according to DNA tests.
The schemes against Chevron and Dole shared several common elements.
Both relied on a false — but superficially compelling — narrative of a multinational company invading an unsophisticated Third World country many years ago, harming the environment and disrupting indigenous communities. Both schemes sought to pressure the companies into huge settlements in the court of public opinion in the hopes that the facts behind the allegations would never be exposed.
This sort of wrongdoing not only harms the companies targeted by such schemes. it undermines our legal system itself.
As the United States Supreme Court has declared, fraud-on-the-court ""involves far more than an injury to a single litigant. It is a wrong against the institutions set up to protect and safeguard the public.""
To be sure, not every lawsuit is fraudulent. Companies that violate the law should be held accountable. That is one of the core functions of a civil justice system. But these cases demonstrate what can happen if that system is abused. Last month's rulings should help kill these pernicious tactics — a benefit not just to the winning litigants, but also for anyone who believes in the rule of law.
Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. is a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. He is a lead lawyer for Chevron and Dole.

Banana importer Dole is to stop using Ethical Choice stickers on its fruit after criticism that the labels could mislead consumers.
This week humanitarian group Oxfam released a report claiming that child labourers exposed to toxic chemicals were used to harvest Dole bananas in the Philippines for supply to New Zealand.
Last year Dole was put on notice by the Commerce Commission that its Ethical Choice brand risked breaching the Fair Trading Act.
Among the concerns was whether consumers might think the stickers were certified by a third party and make Dole appear more ethical than its competitors.
Today the company announced that it would discontinue the use of the Ethical Choice label on all future fruit shipments.
New Zealand manager Steve Barton said supermarket group Foodstuffs, operator of the Pakn'Save and New World chains, had asked Dole to support its position over Ethical Choice, and although the supermarket operator was satisfied, Dole had decided to abandon the label anyway.
""This is causing quite a lot of unnecessary attention for them,"" Barton said.
He said there were a number of inaccuracies in the Oxfam report and Dole was in communication with Oxfam, and would need more information in order to investigate the other allegations.
The company was confident Ethical Choice did not mislead consumers.
""Dole has strict policies and a long track record of leadership on labour and environmental issues,"" he said."ÿÿDole ditches Ethical Choice banana label

					Toothpaste is probably the most regularly used body care product around which is why it was one of the first products we scrutinized for sustainable alternatives. And, with so many healthy and environmentally friendly options available today, why not try a brand that’s trying to do good!
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					VEGAN TOOTHPASTE THAT’S NOT CRUELTY-FREE
				
				
				
				
					Often the term “vegan” and “cruelty free” are used interchangeably. Which is fine for the most part. At its heart, the principle behind each term is the same. The protection of our furry and not-so-furry animal friends and their rights.But there is a critical difference and it’s important to know what it is. By doing so, we’ll ensure that there’s no ethical gap in the products we buy.Cruelty-free products, are by definition products that are not tested on animals. But they still contain animal ingredients or animal by-products which would have necessitated the death of an animal. Which then surely cannot be cruelty-free?Vegan products, are products that don’t contain animal ingredients. But they may still be tested on animals, which is surely not in the spirit of veganism?So, for example, a vegan toothpaste may not contain any animal ingredients but it has been tested on animals. On the flip side, a cruelty free sunscreen that hasn’t been tested on animals may still include glycerin derived from animal parts and is therefore not vegan friendly.Glycerin can (confusingly) also be derived from palm oil.  If you, like us, prefer to avoid palm oil (have a read here, hereand here for some background on the issue), look for a palm oil free option below.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					COLGATE, AQUAFRESH, ORAL-B, SENSODYNE – CRUELTY-FREE TOOTHPASTES?
				
				
				
				
					It’s also worth pointing out that most of the well known conventional toothpastes like Colgate, Oral-B, Sensodyne, Crest and Aquafresh (to name a few), are just about all owned by the same 3 holding companies – Church & Dwight, GlaxoSmithKline, and Procter and Gamble.Which means they’re almost certainly tested on animals.What is surprising though is that they’re likely to be vegan friendly as they don’t contain any animal ingredients or animal byproducts. The usual suspect was glycerin but now they’re manufacturing a cheaper synthetic version of the ingredient which is being used in most of the off-the-shelf vegan toothpastes.Cruelty free and vegan toothpastes are a non-negotiable!
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					UNHEALTHY ADDITIVES IN CRUELTY-FREE, VEGAN TOOTHPASTES
				
				
				
				
					Your run of the mill toothpastes usually contain a cocktail of unhealthy and harmful chemicals. Many of which are  absorbed by the cells in your mouth (which is, like our skin, porous), like:Triclosan, the antibacterial chemical which has been linked to antibiotic resistance and endocrine disruption.Sodium lauryl sulfate or SLS, the foaming agent which has been known to cause skin irritation, canker sores and various dioxanes which are  carcinogenic byproducts.Flouride, the cavity prevention ingredient abundantly found in most water supplies around the world and, of course, our toothpastes. This additive is now coming under fire as unnecessary and unhealthy. Though, the jury still seems to be out on whether or not it is actually detrimental to our health.Microbeads, the tiny plastic pellets that are used in a variety of body care products. Our marine wildlife end up eating these plastic bits and we, as a result of eating fish, also end up ingesting them. Thankfully, most countries these days have banned this ingredient.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					APPROACH TO CRUELTY-FREE VEGAN TOOTHPASTES
				
				
				
				
					If this is your first time visiting Sustainable Jungle, our approach to cruelty-free vegan toothpaste is to look for brands and products that are:vegancruelty freeorganic / naturalpalm oil freehave ethical ingredient sourcing policies anduse thoughtful, ideally zero-waste packaging (meaning it either has no waste at all, or waste that is compostable or widely reusable).Note that some of the options below are not always available in every country. We’ll continue to research and add other toothpastes to the list. Do reach out and let us know if you know of any others that should be featured!

					**Note: Dr Bronner’s have gone the extra mile to ensure their palm oil is truly ethically and sustainably harvested. Read more here  
				
				
				
				
					Dr. Bronner’s Toothpastes: We’ve tried a couple of different Dr. Bronner’s cruelty-free vegan toothpastes. The cinnamon and peppermint flavor.

They don’t contain any detergent foaming agents, fluoride, artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, or sweeteners.If you’re looking for a strong natural toothpaste this probably won’t do the trick, however, it’s perfect for a lighter option or if you have sensitive teeth.

					2. MY MAGIC MUD TOOTHPASTE
				
				
				
						
		
				
				
				
					My Magic Mud ToothpastesThis brand specializes in active charcoal oral care (dental floss, toothpastes and tooth powder).It may seem counter-intuitive but activated charcoal (which is essentially oxidized and reheated version of the stuff you throw on a bbq) works thanks to it’s naturally adhesive qualities that bind to all the usual food and drink that stains our pearly whites.But just bear in mind that charcoal is abrasive so take care in using this product (some dentists suggest using it a couple of times a week) to avoid any chance of wearing away your enamel. This product also includes bentonite clay which absorbs toxins, binding heavy metals and neutralizing bacteria.Overall, Magic Mud’s vegan toothpaste’s have gained some great overall reviews.

					3. MIESSENCE VEGAN TOOTHPASTES
				
				
				
						
		
				
				
				
					*Miessence products are almost all vegan including all their toothpastes. While a handful of their products contain RSPO certified palm oil, their toothpastes are free of palm oil 
				
				
				
				
					Miessence ToothpasteMiessence’s toothpastes are vegan, cruelty-free, mostly organic and free of palm oil, artificial colors, flavorings, fluoride, aluminium and detergents.They contain a couple of interesting ingredients like aloe vera and cinnamon leaf essential oil.They come in three flavors: lemon, mint and anise.  We’ve tried the mint flavor and the taste is quite different to your usual toothpastes and will take a little getting used to.There’s also no foaming agent which may make the toothpaste feel sort of ineffective, however, we think this is more to do with what we’re used to and not about whether the product works or not. This is another good option for sensitive teeth.
				
				
				
				
					About MiessenceMiessence was the world’s first certified organic cosmetic and skincare range.All their products are organic, cruelty-free and vegan (except for a handful which contain organic beeswax). A handful of their products contain palm oil, otherwise the rest of their range are palm oil free. The palm oil they source is RSPO certified, though, as we have discussed in a previous post, this does not necessarily mean that it is sustainable. Miessence are currently on the lookout for alternatives.Miessence are also 110% carbon negative, use renewable wind energy and only source ingredients from fair trade protected growers. Their packaging is made of recycled materials and is also recyclable.

					Green Beaver’s ToothpasteGreen Beaver’s Toothpaste was one of the first products they developed.They have a range of flavors like cilantro mint, cinnamon, frosty mint, green apple, spearmint, star anise and zesty orange. We can vouch for the frosty mint, which is very similar to regular minty toothpastes.According to a number of reviews this is a really effective cruelty free and vegan toothpaste, just make sure you get the flavor best suited to your taste buds (not everyone likes star anise!).Otherwise, they’re made from natural ingredients such as lemon / mint / tea tree extracts, silica, calcium carbonate (natural mineral whiteners) and glycerin (note this is derived from coconut oil).As for the environment, their toothpastes are entirely organic and palm oil free.
				
				
				
				
					About Green BeaverGreen Beaver is a family owned business and have been manufacturing hand-made certified organic personal care products since 2001.All their products are 100% cruelty-free, palm oil free, organic / natural and vegan friendly (except for their lip balms and sunscreen lotions which contain organic beeswax and honey from the Hockley Farm).They’re committed to sustainability as they not only try to source as many local organic ingredients as they can to reduce their carbon footprint, but they’re also involved in a number of initiatives and charitable partnerships.Like installing life saving pond regulators to protecting beavers to raising awareness among the youth of the toxic chemicals found in cosmetics and most recently helping out a women’s shelter in BC and homeless moms in Toronto! Incredible!Green Beaver was also the first Canadian company to be microbead-free since day one.

					Ugly By Nature ToothpasteIf Ugly By Nature’s packaging is anything to go by, they probably produce the yummiest toothpastes around, especially with flavors like wacky watermelon, mixed berry madness and spankin’ spearmint.As for their formulation, they’re purists and only use a select few ingredients like clacium betonite clay, coconut oil, aloe vera, coconut activated charcoal, birch xylitol, food grade hydrogen peroxide and diatomaceous earth (i.e. soft sedimentary earth) and organic flavors.Their vegan toothpastes are also all cruelty-free (PETA certified) and palm oil free.

Published May 13, 2019 by . Last Updated November 4, 2019. What could an ingredient company possibly learn from forcing animals to swim until they nearly drown? Your guess is as good as ours, but thankfully, PETA scientists have persuaded a Dutch company to give up the cruel, worthless experiment.After discussions with PETA, DSM Nutritional Products—which manufactures ingredients used in nutritional supplements and personal-care products—has confirmed that it will no longer use the widely discredited “forced swim test.” In this experiment, mice, rats, or other small animals are dosed with a test substance and placed in inescapable beakers filled with water, forcing them to swim to keep from drowning.DSM previously subjected more than 200 mice and rats to the test in order to make health claims about ingredients such as queen bee acid (a component of royal jelly), DHA, and oregano extract. Animals used in the procedure frantically try to escape by attempting to climb up the sides of the beakers or even diving underwater in search of an exit. They paddle furiously, desperately trying to keep their heads above water. Eventually, most give up and start to float.Forcing panicked animals to swim in fear for their lives is hideously cruel and tells us nothing about human responses to particular ingredients.Experimenters affiliated with DSM have claimed that the test was used to measure animals’ “depression-like behavior” and identify potentially antidepressant substances, but the theory that the test serves these purposes has been debunked. PETA scientists reviewed published studies and found that the test was less predictive of a compound’s effectiveness in treating human depression than a coin toss.Help PETA Abolish Forced Swim TestsDSM has made the right call in leaving such bad science behind. The supplement company joins Johnson & Johnson and pharmaceutical giant AbbVie in ending its use of this test. PETA is now calling on Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, and Pfizer to follow suit.Click below to access our easy-to-use form for demanding that companies stop using the cruel, worthless forced swim test:"ÿÿPETA Pushes DSM Nutritional Products to End Forced Swim Test | PETA
360ÿ2019-11-25ÿ14ÿMistreating Animal rightsÿ2ÿAnimalsÿ1ÿnegativeÿ97ÿEast Fork Farmsÿ84ÿPETAÿhttps://headlines.peta.org/indiana-pig-farm/ÿ"Video: Nonstop Misery, Filth, Suffering in Decrepit Indiana Pig Farm
A new eyewitness video reveals agony and prolonged death for pigs amid filth at East Fork Farms near Brownstown, Indiana.The farm supplied JBS USA, the nation’s second-largest pig slaughterer, which sells pig flesh branded as Swift Premium and La Herencia and is a subsidiary of Brazil-based JBS S.A., the world’s largest slaughterer of farmed animals. A day after PETA released this video, JBS USA announced that it had “immediately and indefinitely banned East Fork Farms from [its] supply chain” and later informed PETA that the ban was permanent.The video shows piglets slowly dying in crates, out of reach of their distraught mothers, while the bodies of others rot just a few feet away. Please, won’t you help these intelligent, sensitive animals?Years of Misery Confined to CratesMother pigs were found crammed inside metal crates barely any larger than their own bodies. Up to 1,200 pigs at this farm spend most of their miserable lives in these crates. The video shows others so crowded in pens that they couldn’t move.These intelligent animals had no psychological stimulation and no opportunity to take a single step in any direction.Impregnated repeatedly, when it was time to give birth, they were confined to crates that were even more restrictive. They spent day and night lying immobile on the slatted floor.Pigs used for breeding cannot walk or even turn around. Their muscles atrophy, and they’re chronically sore and stiff. They never get to engage in any natural behavior. Eventually, after several years of this round-the-clock imprisonment and continuous insemination, pregnancy, and birthing, their bodies wear out.Newborns Suffering and Slowly Dying out of Reach of Their Distraught MothersPregnant sows were forced to give birth in gestation crates and even more restrictive “farrowing crates,” which prevented them from tending to their babies for the first few weeks of their lives. Without their mothers’ help, some died slowly, enduring intense and unrelieved suffering.Dead piglets were found decomposing just a few feet away from their mothers and siblings.One worker cut the tails off the surviving piglets—without any pain relief, as is common in pig factories—then threw the crying youngsters several feet into the air to another worker. Their tails were left strewn on the filthy floor.All this happened in the presence of their distressed mothers.Sick, Hurt, Lame, and Languishing in FilthYoung pigs were moved to bleak pens, where up to 4,000 were being fattened on any given day for eventual slaughter (if they survived that long).Pigs with ailments such as bloody sores, abscesses, and injured legs, shoulders, or hooves were left to suffer and languish on the filthy floors.A sow who appeared incapable of standing or moving away from her own feces was unable to reach a source of drinking water. When the eyewitness offered her some, she drank frantically for nearly two minutes.Roaches, Maggots, and Manure EverywhereThese animals—who are actually very clean and, given sufficient space, don’t normally soil the areas where they eat or sleep—were forced to live amid feces and just above the reeking pit that held their manure, which continuously backed up beneath the slatted floor.Several piglets were seen struggling to stay afloat in the manure pit.The flooring teemed with maggots, and other surfaces were crawling with countless roaches.Update: PETA Has Received Additional Footage, Revealing Even More Horrors at East Fork FarmsFollowing the release of this exposé, PETA received even more whistleblower footage, which revealed severely ill and/or injured piglets left to languish in filthy conditions, dead piglets left to rot throughout the sheds, and a trash can overflowing with piglets’ corpses and teeming with maggots.In one of the cramped, restrictive farrowing crates, which prevent mother pigs from turning around, one live piglet was tightly pinned against the bars of the crate, maimed and dangling. Dead piglets were left to lie among the living.The whistleblower also included this letter imploring the state police to help the pigs and describing the suffocating stench and horrifying screams coming from this operation amid the pain, fear, and death.See the new footage below:You Can Help Stop This!Pigs are friendly, inquisitive, smart animals who are at least as sensitive and intelligent as dogs. This video spotlights just one farm, but the cruelty in the pork industry is rampant and routine.Please spare pigs enormous pain and suffering by choosing to stop eating them. With so many delicious, healthy options, it’s never been easier to leave animal-derived foods off your plate. JBS USA permanently banned East Fork Farms from its supply chain after hearing from PETA and compassionate members like you about the deplorable conditions there.Without fail, when we write to confined animal feeding operations and slaughterhouses to relay whistleblower complaints about conditions such as these, companies respond with the claim that they “take animal welfare seriously.” Please ask others in the pork industry in this region if they consider the conditions depicted in this footage to be “acceptable farm management practices,” or if they will keep pigs from East Fork Farms out of their supply chains.Crates, Misery, Pain, and Slow Death for Pigs on Indiana 'Farm' Teeming With Maggots and Roaches"ÿÿVideo: Nonstop Misery, Filth, Suffering in Decrepit Indiana Pig Farm

					Cruelty free is on fleek. (Did we use that word right?)What we mean to say is that conscious, cruelty free beauty is catching on. Color us even more impressed than the one time we managed to get our eyeliner perfectly symmetrical. But with so many fantastic vegan, cruelty free makeup brands, why are we still using natural makeup brushes?  Is it just us, or is it outrageous to use animal parts to apply animal free product?For years, people have shied away from synthetic bristles, quite literally brushing them off as inferior and cheap, like “Barbie doll hair”. That’s why animal hair applicators on the whole have long outlived animal ingredients in the makeup itself.  It’s time to uncover the truth behind makeup brushes (so that you can more humanely apply your cover-up).  That’s why we’ve sought out the best cruelty free vegan makeup brushes to give you the tools (literally) to make your ENTIRE makeup routine absent the animals.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					NATURAL MAKEUP BRUSHES VS. VEGAN MAKEUP BRUSHES 
				
				
				
				
					This is one of the few instances where we DON’T want to see the word “natural” printed on the package. Natural makeup brushes are typically not vegan friendly, because their “natural” bristles are simply various types of animal hair.The type of animal varies for different brush purposes with the stiffness of their fur. For instance, stiff badger hair is used in brow brushes while softer pony hair is used for blush application. Other animals getting unwilling bobs for beauty’s sake include goats, horses, boats, squirrels, and minks.Even more troublesome than the idea of wiping animal fur on your face is that many of these brushes are still labeled as cruelty free, because technically, “cruelty free” only pertains to animal testing.  You’ll find the “cruelty free” label is often meaningless when applied to makeup brushes. Because while animals aren’t subject to product testing, they ARE still hunted from the wild (squirrels and badgers), shorn too short (goats), kept in cages (ALL), and even slaughtered in ways that least damage the pelt.  Not to get too gruesome, but that can include drowning, electrocution, strangulation, and even skinning alive, especially in common fur trade countries where animal welfare laws are lax to non-existent. If that doesn’t sound like cruelty, we don’t know what does.Some companies claim that harvesting the hair doesn’t hurt the animals. If only we could believe them! The truth is, the animal fur used in makeup brushes is either a product of the extremely problematic fur industry, or equally problematic meat industry. 
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					A VEGAN MAKEUP BRUSH IS THE ONLY TRULY CRUELTY FREE MAKEUP BRUSH.  
				
				
				
				
					The ethical gap between vegan and cruelty free is never more apparent than when it comes to makeup brushes.  If it seems nonsensical to you that something can be “cruelty free” yet contain animal byproducts, that’s because it is.So how do we get around this giant labeling loophole that allows cosmetic companies to cage and yank out animal hair with one hand, while writing “cruelty free” on the box with the other?We turn to fur free (AKA synthetic) makeup brushes!
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					WHY SYNTHETIC IS SUPERIOR.
				
				
				
				
					
							
																					Photo by freestocks.org on Unsplash
										
					
				
				
				
				
					Animal welfare completely aside, synthetic bristles are better than natural brushes on several levels. All those rumors about them not performing as well? It’s just not true anymore.For one, synthetic bristles are more durable and resistant to damage.  For the same reason that human hair can’t handle repeated chemical treatment and washing, animal hair also quickly degrades under these circumstances. Animal hair also absorbs a lot more makeup than non-porous synthetic bristles.  That means they’re way easier to clean, and you’ll find yourself washing less makeup down the drain. Save a mink AND some money. This non-porous nature also makes them more resistant to bacteria and less prone to drying out, which will feel better on your skin. That’s in addition to being hypoallergenic.And if nothing else, synthetic fibers just plain deliver better performance! They don’t break, shed, lose flexibility, and work over a wider variety of makeup types. The softer synthetic texture also lends them to creating a more blended, less blotchy overall finish.  Smokey eyes and soft, blended contours are all the rage, and no brush does a better layered look than a synthetic one.
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					MAKING YOUR SYNTHETIC BRISTLES MORE SUSTAINABLE.
				
				
				
				
					The one valid area of concern regarding the synthetic bristles. Since these bristles are made of things like nylon, Taclon, and polyester, they don’t exactly have a good “end of life” outcome. Synthetic fibers take years and years to biodegrade, and they’re definitely not compostable.And while there are plenty of wood and bamboo makeup brushes out there (see below), there are thus far no options with entirely plant-based bristles. That means if you want to compost your bamboo makeup brush (as we hope you do!), you’ll need to remove the bristles first. We’re still of the opinion that when a choice has to be made, concern over potential waste must take a backseat to animal welfare. However, we also believe in not being haphazard about your brushes.Especially with the second section of brushes on our list, the ones with either less sustainable wood or totally non-compostable handles as well as bristles, it’s important to get as much life out of these brushes as possible. So how to go about making the most sustainable choice when it comes to makeup brushes? Start by sticking to what you have. The most sustainable makeup brushes are the ones you already have. Do you REALLY need to buy new brushes? If the answer is unequivocally yes, can you buy a second had set that has been well looked after? If you don’t already own makeup brushes and can’t find any second hand options, the next best thing is to buy high quality vegan makeup brushes, and only buy what you need. Minimalism also means minimal impact! While the vegan makeup brush sets below are great, you might not need a full 12-piece set if you already own some brushes or don’t apply tons of makeup. Proper brush care and maintenance can also help drastically improve the lifespan of your vegan makeup brushes. This means washing your brushes thoroughly and often, and letting them fully dry out. Leaving your makeup to cake and clump in the bristles is the shortest path to early brush retirement (and smudged makeup).When your brushes finally do start losing bristles or just don’t work as well anymore, try to repurpose them rather than just throw them away. Maybe you have or know children that could use them for arts and crafts! If not, see if a local school or daycare could use them.Now that we’ve all brushed about on the facts, let’s get down to business with the top vegan makeup brushes.

The opposite of kindness is not cruelty, it is inattention, and we are paying attention […] Know that you are a perfect and whole being, and that we are here to support you on your journey to a more intentional lifestyle and conscious beauty. And what good are makeup brushes without the makeup? Elate also sells a full range of cruelty free cosmetics, including pressed and loose eye powders, zero waste mascara (which we’ve covered before), eyeliner, face makeup, and lipstick. All are made using 90% organic ingredients and the other 10% are due to a prioritization of fair trade over organic. The whole product line isn’t palm oil free (they use RSPO certified palm suppliers).In addition to their brush handles, their compacts and palettes are also bamboo and are totally refillable. Every refill comes in plantable seed paper: just wet, plant, and water!They also offset all their emissions with Bullfrog Power and give back to multiple local and women’s-based charities, like the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (they sponsor three elephants named Maisha, Dololo, and Larr – which we love!).

					About The Body ShopYou’ve probably heard this name before. Think back to just about any shopping mall you’ve walked through!This certified B-corp operates entirely cruelty free (though only vegetarian due only to some beeswax and honey). Check out their 2018 sustainability report.  The Body Shop is now owned by Natura, who are also a B-Corp and Certified Cruelty Free. The Body Shop’s “Nature Inspired Beauty” includes any and all things related to fragrance, skincare, haircare, and makeup, which they been perfecting since starting up in Brighton, England all the way back in 1976.Since then, they’ve started the Trade Not Aid partnership (which partners with local ingredient sourcing communities to provide scholarships and well paid job opportunities for local women), as well as numerous other social and environmental campaigns. There’s too many to go into detail here, but follow the links for more info: Community Trade Recycled PlasticChildhood Dreams for the Future – This one is so pure and wholesome!Forever Against Animal Testing – They’re actually partnering with Cruelty Free International here to petition the UN to internationally intervene in countries where animal testing is legal/mandated. Re-Wild the WorldFor a concise visual timeline of all their sustainable business milestones, see here.Most notably, in 2016 they initiated Enrich Not Exploit, a vow to become to world most ethical and sustainable business by hitting 14 primary targets by 2020. Part of how they measure their progress toward these goals is by literally scoring the environmental impact of product families by measuring things like biodegradability, how renewable the natural ingredients are, the ratio of “green chemistry” vs. more impactful processing methods, and how recyclable the packaging is. From 2016 to 2017, they decreased the environmental impact of their product line by 5%!In the words of Founder Anita Roddick:“The business of business should not be about money. It should be about responsibility. It should be about public good, not private greed.”Lastly, their rewards club is called the Love Your Body Club, which fits so well into their theme of female empowerment. By joining, you can either use rewards earned through purchases to either buy to donate them to one of two wildlife conservation charities.

Plus it all comes in their It’s a Wrap organic cotton wrap made by Re-wrap, “a social enterprise whose purpose is to create organic, hand crafted textile products that will have the most positive impact on people and the environment”. Despite Lush’s huge product line and demand, know that each multi use brush is still handmade.

					About LushLush is one of the premier (and first) names in conscious beauty. Having been making cruelty free cosmetics for over three decades, they’ve had a lot of time to develop an extensive line of perfume, makeup, hair care, dental care, and so many more personal care products.As part of their cruelty free ethos (for puppies, watch this video), they not only don’t test on animals but only deal with suppliers and merchants that also do not.Just note that for many of their cosmetics and personal care products, they’re not 100% natural or palm oil free, though you can find options that are both.We especially love that Lush not only combats cruelty free cosmetics on a brand level, but on an industry wide one. Since 2012, Lush has sponsored the annual Lush Award, a £250,000 prize given to those working in whatever way (i.e. scientifically or politically) toward eliminating animal ingredients in cosmetics.

					About Furless Vegan Makeup BrushesWhat makes Furless synthetic bristles unique is that they’ve been crimped to mimic animal hair. This makes then a little coarser, but far better at picking up and holding powder makeup.  Don’t think that means they’ll feel rough though. They promise to “never sell you a cheap, ugly, scratchy brush, EVER!”As for design, Furless makes brushes for every fancy. The Must Haves feature lovely blue handles with gold ferrules. For those who want to channel some punk-rock vibes into their makeup routine, the Perfectly Pink and Purple lines sport sleek black handles and either pink or purple topped bristles. The list goes on.We especially love the classic all-black noir vibe of the Couture line. These are Furless’s “Powerhouse” brushes, feature more durable and intense bristles for bolder looks. We also think Furless makes one of the best vegan makeup brush sets. Their Must Have Professional Makeup Brush Set comes with 20 brushes for only $170. This is an excellent deals either for cosmetologists just building their toolbox.
				
				
				
				
					About FurlessFurless all started in the Land Down Under, but they’ve since expanded considerably to having a separate USA branch. Aside from makeup tools, they also make actual makeup.If you couldn’t tell from the name, Furless is passionate about separating animals from cosmetics: “We believe that cruelty for the sake of art or vanity just ain’t cool.” That’s why they bear not just one but several vegan and cruelty free accreditations, including Choose Cruelty Free, Fur Free Retailer, and PETA. They do not sell to China and other animal testing mandated countries. Instead, they believe in alternative, superior, and voluntary methods of cosmetic testing. This link of theirs has tons of reference material if you STILL need more convincing that we should adopt a vegan or bust brush mentality. Lastly, Furless believes in empowering women by boosting their self-esteem, leading them away from the problematic body image mainstream society holds, and lauding achievements over looks.

With metallic brown beechwood handles and brass ferrules, this set is both glam and earthy.Just a quick word of caution: From some reviews we’ve read, there are quite a few counterfeit Nanshy brushes out there on Amazon. If you’re ordering from there, make sure it’s from the official Nanshy store.
				
				
				
				
					About NanshyThis UK based company specializes in cosmetics tools and tools alone. Rather than divide their attention and resources to produce what they see as an already “over-saturated” cosmetics market, Nanshy helps people find “their look” through tools of the trade. After all, even with the finest paints, what good is the painter without his brush? That’s essentially Nanshy’s philosophy regarding cosmetics. The “Nanshy way” is to bring consumers the finest tools made from top materials gathered from reputable suppliers. They’re constantly taking strides to improve these materials through regroups research and extensive testing.But not on animals! Nanshy “guarantee[s] no animal has been killed, tortured or harmed during the production.” This statement is PETA verified.

					About Kat Von DKat Von D, named for the founder, owner, and all around business bad*ss, toes the line between luxury and edgy. Kat herself is a bold and outspoken individual and her brand is a direct reflection of that.  No wonder, considering she prides herself on being a crucial part of product development. She tests everything on herself first and foremost and follows through all the way to package artwork and design.As we mentioned above, Kat Von D makes cruelty free perfumes and vegan makeup (newly absent of non-vegan ingredients like beeswax and carmine).More than anything, Kat Von D believes in “makeup made with love, not animals”, and that cruelty free PETA certification extends even to their parent company, Kendo (which is NOT always a given in big brand cosmetics).  Neither sell into China and uphold strict ethical sourcing policies that lead them to do business only with companies that follow the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. 
				
				
				
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					ARE THERE SOME VEGAN MAKEUP BRUSHES MISSING?
				
				
				
				
					In addition to the vegan makeup brush brands above, we found a few others that we really did like and debated about whether to include.  But for one reason or another, whether it be lack of consistency, lack of reviews, or limited availability due to lack of stockists, we decided they didn’t quite make the cut.Marc Jacobs, for example, makes some luxury vegan makeup brush sets, like the “Your Place or Mine?” but the company still sells their cosmetics into China, which mandates animal testing. Therefore even though the brushes themselves are cruelty free and vegan, they’re still supporting non cruelty-free business practices.

					Ethical consumption is on the rise and people across the world are demanding products that are not only good for themselves, but for the planet and all creatures on it. The food industry may be at the center of this movement, but it goes far beyond what you put in your body.  What you put on it matters just as much!We believe that regardless of what your diet is (vegan, vegetarian or omnivore) none of your cosmetic and body care products need to contain animal ingredients.Hence our search for the best vegan hair products and brands!
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					“VEGAN BRANDS” vs “CRUELTY FREE BRANDS”
				
				
				
				
					Before we get into the detail, we thought we’d just be clear on what the vegan label actually means.Please do skip ahead if this is old news. Chances are, if you’re reading this article, you already know, but just in case, we’ll clear up any confusion.  Vegan means the product contains no animal by-products, or ingredients that came from an animal.  It’s not always the easy to spot stuff like milk, eggs, and cheese, either.  Sometimes, they’re less obvious, such as honey, beeswax, gelatin, and yogurt.Now vegan does not necessarily mean cruelty-free, which means neither products NOR ingredients were tested on animals at any stage in development. While referring to two totally different parts of sourcing and production, the two are not so dissimilar at their core philosophy of protecting animal rights.Despite that, every once in a while there arises an ethical gap between the two principals in which you’ll find products that tick one, but strangely not the other. For instance:Cruelty-free products, while not tested on animals, may still contain animal ingredients or by-products which would have necessitated the death of an animal. This, of course, begs the question – are these products truly cruelty-free?Vegan products, while they don’t contain any animal ingredients, may still be tested on animals, which is surely not in the spirit of veganism?We go much deeper into how to avoid some common pitfalls into this gap in another article, so let’s move on to hair. While this list focuses on vegan products, we believe to be truly vegan at the core, it must also be cruelty free, so we’ve aimed to hit both points, as you should, too!
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					NON-VEGAN INGREDIENTS TO BE AWARE OF
				
				
				
				
					Setting aside the fact that SO MANY hair companies (even common salon) test their products on animals, hair products are full of tricky things most of us don’t even know are animal byproducts. Here are some sneaky animal byproducts commonly found in hair products, courtesy of The Vegan Woman:Biotin (hair creams and conditioners): Vitamin-B enriched texturizer that comes from milk or yeast. Instead look for Vitamin-B derived from carrots, berries, and members of the lettuce family.Cetyl Alcohol (shampoo): A waxy substance from the head cavity (“spermaceti”) of whales and dolphins. It can be replaced by plant derived cetyl alcohol – althought ideally look for coconut derived as cetyl alcohol can also be derived from palm oil – a whole other issue…Gelatin (hair gels): Derived from boiled animals carcasses (ethical reasons aside, why would anyone want that in their hair?!). Can be replaced by certain mosses (like Irish moss) or seaweed and kelp.Hyaluronic Acid (“moisturizing” hair products): Made from umbilical cords and synovial joint fluid. Again, ew.  Soy and vegetables are natural sources of it, so a healthy diet can actually mitigate all need for such products!Keratin (hair masks and restorative products): Harvested from skin, hooves, horns, hair, and feathers. Plenty of herbs and natural oils provide the same restorative benefits.Stearic Acid (hairspray and conditioner): Comes from animal fat (horrifically often from euthanized pets and slaughtered farm animals). Can be replaced by cocoa and shea butters but again can also be made from palm oil, which has terrible environmental implications.For more, check out PETA’s complete list of animal-derived ingredients. Now we know that reading labels can get tedious (and lots of smaller companies just don’t have the money to get the big badge easily labeling them as vegan or cruelty-free even if they are), so we’ve put together a list of some of our best vegan hair products that we hope you’ll find useful.

					About Acure Organics Vegan Hair ProductsAcure organics haircare range is simple but thorough.They have a range of shampoos and conditioners but the focus in this article is their dry shampoo.Dry shampoo is one of those super tricky products to get right and reading through reviews form multiple other dry shampoo options, people either love them or hate them.Those who hate them tend to not like the light coloured powder in dark hair because the product typically takes longer to absorb and can make darker hair look like it’s just had white powder applied – clearly not ideal.Acure has attempted to resolve this as they now also have dry shampoo for brunette to dark hair as well as their original dry shampoo.

					*Note: We have attempted to confirm the policies directly with this brand 
				
				
				
				
					Tints of Nature Vegan Hair DyeNatural haircare doesn’t necessarily mean sticking to your natural color.  We totally understand the urge to shake things up.Tints of Nature offers easy, at-home dye kits (saving you big bucks at the salon!) for both permanent and semi-permanent henna dyes designed to be gentle on your head and hair, being completely free from ammonia, parabens, sulfates, propylene glycol, and resorcinol.While not completely 100% organic (they are currently rated around 75%, using 95% naturally derived ingredients), they are working toward that goal, and use the absolute lowest possible level of PPD (p-Phenylenediamine).  And only when an alternative is not possible.In fact, the dyes are even fortified with aloe and citrus to add all-natural hydration and shine to your hair.
				
				
				
				
					About Tints of NatureThis U.K. based company is changing the game by offering a nearly all-natural solution to something once thought completely chemical, earning an average of 4.7 out of 5 star reviews. They are not only PETA-certified vegan and Choose-certified cruelty-free, but they are also a member of the UK organization Cosmetics Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) that actively works to promote non-animal products and testing in production in the beauty industry.In addition to animal welfare, they are proactive in minimizing their environmental impact, from sourcing (they get over 75% of ingredients right from within the UK to minimize shipping), to manufacturing (recycling everything they can and using low-carbon, energy-efficient manufacturing methods), to packaging.Back in 2003, they started using 100% recycled cardboard for their boxes and have since saved 225,000kg of virgin cardboard.  All packing chips made from 100% biodegradable, septic-safe corn.Some of Tints of Nature’s products appear to contain palm oil derivatives – we are confirming their palm oil and ethical sourcing policies directly with them.Note: Per the Tints of Nature Website re their new vegan status: “Previous batches of Sulfate-Free Shampoo & Scalp Treatment are still in circulation, which contain a milk derivative. Any products purchased online are guaranteed to contain the new vegan friendly formula.”
				
				
				
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					12. RAHUA VOLUMINOUS HAIR SPRAY
				
				
				
						
		
				
				
				
					*Note: We are confirming policies directly with this brand 
				
				
				
				
					Rahua Vegan Hair SprayRahua makes a handful of hair products (shampoo, conditioner, etc.) all enriched with rahua oil, including their Voluminous Hair Spray, though spritzer is more accurate.Unlike traditonal hairsprays, it won’t leave hair feeling crinkly and crisp, but rather provides a soft, all-day hold that works especially well on difficult hair types, such as fine or oily hair. It’s also non-aerosol (so non-damaging to the ozone) and provides UV protection.Unlike their Defining Hair Spray, this one is alcohol-free as well as USDA certified organic with no parabens, sulfates, phthalates, gluten, silicones, or synthetic fragrances.
				
				
				
				
					About RahuaRahua’s company slogan is “rainforest grown beauty”.  We know that doesn’t sound very eco-friendly, and we were skeptical at first, too, but after reading their full story, it all became clearer.Pioneered by New York City’s Fabian Lliguin and his wife Anna Ayers, Rahua creates all-natural hair care products using rahua oil, which (scientifically speaking) has a smaller molecule size that allows it to penetrate strands of hair to moisture from the inside, rather than merely coating hair strands.Unlike the many beauty products harvested unsustainably from the rainforest, Rahua works withover 500 indiginous Quechua-Shua tribes to ethically harvest this oil using the same ritualistic methods these tribes have used for centuries.This sacred oil and these indigenous communities are handled respectfully and with great care:“We purchase direct from tribespeople who cultivate ingredients using ancient traditional methods and pay them a higher price in order to honor and sustain their work, their way of life, and the forest itself.”For this reason, the company is certified Symbiotic (i.e. “rainforest grown (wild) in undisturbed virgin forest, harvested and prepared using indigenous knowledge by people indigenous to the virgin forest environment, and it must be purchased at a price that helps to grow and sustain these traditions, build economies, and empower the indigenous people”).Their products are also non-toxic, vegan, cruelty-free, vegan, paraben-free, sulfate-free, and gluten-free. Rahua’s full list of ingredients implies that they do use palm oil derivatives but we are confirming their policies directly with them. As with Yarok, this product is not plastic-free.
				
				
				
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
				
				
					
															
											
				
				
				
				
				
					About Apple Cider VinegarSurprisingly enough, apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a vegan hair cleanser, removing any build-up or greasy residue left behind by shampoo and product, while not completely stripping its own natural oils (meaning you go longer without having to wash your hair!).It leaves your hair silky, smooth, and tangle-free.Beyond that, ACV improves overall follicle health, by balancing the pH of the hair and scalp and removing bacteria. Say goodbye to greasy looking roots or dandruff!  And no fear, we promise you won’t smell like vinegar, but for more specifics, we talk about how to make and use it in this article.Plus it has SO many other uses around the home and kitchen. Drink it for digestive benefits, use it to clean, whatever!Nothing like a single product that does it all.If you live a zero waste lifestyle, you can often find ACV at your local bulk foods store which is definitely the most sustainable way to buy it.If you don’t have access to a bulk store, try to buy the largest bottle you can to minimize packaging. There are lots of brands out there, but we recommend Bragg because it comes in glass bottles and is USDA certified organic, made of non-GMO raw apples, and is unheated, unfiltered, unpasteurized.
				
				
				
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					FINAL THOUGHTS ON VEGAN HAIR PRODUCTS AND BRANDS
				
				
				
				
					Ethical consumption and vegan products are starting to become wonderfully prolific.As creators and companies are becoming more aware of their impact on people’s health (and hair!) as well as the environment, it’s becoming easier than ever to achieve multiple levels of sustainability.And that’s our goal, to show you how many effective, sustainable and ethical vegan hair products and brands there are out there.We hope we’ve helped provide some useful suggestions for you that will satisfy not only vegans, but in many cases, those who are also focused on a more zero waste lifestyle.If we missed any product that you especially love and think belongs on our list, or just want to give us a shout by leaving a comment or sending a message.

Is Everlane ethical? That’s the question I’m asking today, as my investigative series into the ethics of our clothing continues.



While Fashion Revolution Week may be over, the Fashion Revolution certainly isn’t, and my magnifying glass has turned from asking fast fashion brands “Who made my clothes?” to looking at the ways my favourite ethical brands do things right. 



(Want to join in with the fun? Here’s my guide on how to be part of the Fashion Revolution which I wrote for the Ethical Influencers community).



And so today, I’ve done a little experiment – I’ve looked into one of my most coveted brands, Everlane*, to see how ethical they truly are. 







What is ethical fashion?



Just like in my investigation of ARKET, I want to start out by establishing what ethical fashion really means. There’s three main areas to cover:



Sustainable fashion: clothes made from materials and practices that are earth-friendlySlow fashion: clothes that are not governed by seasonal trends, classics, investment piecesEthical or fair fashion: clothes that pay a fair wage to their producers, garment workers, etc.



To get a balanced conclusion, I’ll be looking to answer whether Everlane fits into all/any of these.







Who is Everlane?



So, to start, I think it’s worth delving into the brand’s origin story. I try to do this with every brand I come across before shopping with them. My reasoning? You can usually see if their ethical standpoint was ingrained at the start, or if they’ve chosen to sprinkle things in later on, which is often the root problem of greenwashing.



Everlane is US-based fashion retailer creating high quality clothing, using “ethical factories”, and championing transparency. The business was founded in 2010 by Michael Preysman and Jesse Farmer. Interestingly, they started off selling only menswear, focusing on creating basic, high quality apparel with transparent pricing. 



Over the years, their approach has won them hundreds of thousands of fans, customers, and millions in investment. They now stock menswear, womenswear, footwear, bags and accessories.



They credit their online-only approach and their radical transparency as the reasons why they can compete with high street fashion. (Although this is changing – they recently opened their first stores in San Fransisco and New York). 







What does Everlane stand for?



Like all good brands, Everlane has a few key values it really sticks to. Their main focus is “Radical Transparency”, which covers three main activities:



Working with ethical factories around the worldSourcing fine materialsSharing the supply chain journey of each garment



Of course, it’s easy to just say all this. In fact, H&M are currently implementing a very similar model with their clothing, without giving true transparency.



The second of Everlane’s unique selling points is its design – dubbed “Modern Basics”, their aim is to create high quality pieces, designed with clean lines and classic styles, that can be worn over and over.



When you dig into the backstory of Everlane, you can see that both of these values have been at their core since the brand’s inception, and today they are – quite rightly – leaders in the ethical fashion space.







Is Everlane ethical?



So, it’s time to dig deeper. Does Everlane pay its workers fair wages, and treat them fairly?







Everlane’s ethical factories



Thankfully, it’s really easy to find out. Everlane lists their factories on their website, with manufacturers in America, China, Italy, Peru, Spain, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.



You can trace each product on the Everlane site back to the factory that made it, and also read the story as to why Everlane chose to work with them. This empowering information gives every customer the option to know who made their clothes, where they were made, and how they were made too.















Everlane’s transparent pricing







You can also do this per item – their transparent pricing guides are listed underneath each garment, showing how much they paid for materials, labour, and transport. This also shows how much profit Everlane makes per piece, and how much the traditional retail equivalent would cost.



For example, the (gifted) wide leg crop pants* I’m wearing in my above pics, their $68 price tag is made up of:



$10.57 for materials$1.41 for hardware$9.00 for labour$3.48 for duties$0.75 for transport$43 for mark-up



This seems like a reasonable amount spent on each area, except transport costs. These pants were made in China, so there are definitely some air miles involved – and $0.75 seems awfully low. Clearly there’s no carbon emissions offsetting going on here.



(Also a word on the mark-up: you have to remember that this cost covers everything from office payroll to marketing budget, so it makes sense that it’s a large portion of each item).















Alongside carbon emissions offsetting, there is one thing that I believe would improve Everlane’s transparency further: an overarching report into the treatment of their workers. 



From the information on their website, I still can’t tell how much workers are paid per factory, how many hours people work on average, or whether they have access to trade union representation – so some kind of easily comparable report into this would make me feel even more empowered as a customer. Plus, numerical data is a lot easier to interpret than wordy summaries about each factory.







Is Everlane sustainable?



At first glance, the materials Everlane uses are similar to many other brands. Cotton, elastane, leather, wool, cashmere – they’re all there. 



For these to be sustainable, a few things need to be looked at: are clothes made from mixed fibres? Do they take measures to source organic raw materials? And what about recycled fibres?



It’s nice to see most of Everlane’s clothing is made from 100% cotton or linen. This includes their jeans, meaning post-consumer garment recycling is possible. When asked, Everlane said they are looking into the circularity of their ranges (see below).



I’m yet to see much in the way of organic materials, but perhaps that’s to do with their pricing model. 



And as Everlane works with high quality materials, their use of recycled materials is quite restricted. Right now, their focus is on plastic – they’re committing to eliminating all virgin plastic from their supply chain by 2021, and they announced this change with their ReNew recycled outwear range*.







Is Everlane slow fashion?



Finally, onto slow fashion. Everlane designs modern basics, so their turnover of styles is a lot slower than fast fashion.



As an affiliate of Everlane, I’ve been aware of their changing collections over the past few months. For a popular brand, they release new styles each month, but these tend to rest on their site for months on end.



My classic cream cashmere jumper* that was gifted to me in December 2018 still sits on their site as of writing in May 2019.



Interestingly, they do have lots of seasonal promotions – so they are not quite seasonless – but definitely slower than a typical high street store.







What does Everlane say?



To write this piece, I got in touch with Everlane to ask them four key questions, covering their ethics, sustainability, slow fashion, and circularity:



1. Who makes Everlane’s clothing? Do you ensure your workers are in a safe and healthy environment? If so, how?



Take a look at our factories page as well as [our] press kit, they both give insight into who makes our clothes, how we vet the factories, and  how we make sure they’re safe.



Relevant information from Everlane’s press kit:



Our factory partners work with 17 factories in seven countries. We look for factories that work with premium brands we respect, and more importantly, we look for partners and owners that really respect the people they employ. We visit these factories often and have developed strong, personal relationships with the management.For the past two years, all profits made on Black Friday went directly to improving the lives of the workers at our factories.



2. Do you use sustainable materials?



Our denim and ReNew press releases note some of our sustainable materials. Further information can be found under each product description on the site.



Relevant information from Everlane’s press releases:



Everlane is making a commitment: No virgin plastic in their entire supply chain by 2021.Everlane Denim … is made at the world’s cleanest factory. The water recovery and filtration is so sophisticated, you can actually drink the recycled water.



3. How many seasons does Everlane produce each year?



We produce new product on a monthly basis. 



4. Do you take any post-sale measures to ensure the longevity/circularity of your clothing?



We’re actively looking into this, as we think about sustainability and the lifecycle of our clothing.







Overall…



Everlane is an ethical fashion brand. Sure, they’re not perfect. They could do with offsetting their carbon emissions. Their new stores make me question their competitive online-only approach. But I’m yet to meet even one fashion brand that does absolutely everything right. 



The one thing I really like about Everlane is their commitment – once they’ve set a goal, they fulfil it 100%. Their 2021 ban on virgin plastic covers plastic packaging and plastic at their offices. Their denim is some of the cleanest made in the world. I’m excited to see what they are planning next.



Everlane is moving towards being a sustainable fashion brand. Their ReNew collection and recycled Denim are obviously their showstopper ranges when it comes to sustainability, but they also use a lot of natural materials that have the potential to be recycled. And not just that – they’re wearable, loveable, and high quality. That in itself increases the number of times you want to wear that garment, and I can honestly say my pieces from Everlane are some of my most cherished.



Everlane is a hybrid slow fashion brand. Everlane is seemingly uninterested in producing slow fashion, although they do have a slower level of production compared to the 52 weekly seasons of fast fashion. This may be to do with their careful design process, or their high quality creation, so while they’re not invested in this area they do play into it.







Will I still shop with Everlane?



Yes. There’s still room for improvement, but I like their values, approach, and style. They also seem open to feedback – from their press kit:



“We use the feedback they collect to better plan our products. This research can inform any aspect of production: from before we even design a garment to after you’ve worn it.”



…so if you do want them to work on something, be vocal about it.



One thing’s for sure – Everlane has its heart in the right place. These words from their press kit sum up their attitude perfectly, and I tend to agree:



“It’s our hope—and it’s been our personal experience—that the more people understand about how their products are made and priced, the more thoughtful they will be about what they buy.”

For these to be sustainable, a few things need to be looked at: are clothes made from mixed fibres? Do they take measures to source organic raw materials? And what about recycled fibres?



It’s nice to see most of Everlane’s clothing is made from 100% cotton or linen. This includes their jeans, meaning post-consumer garment recycling is possible. When asked, Everlane said they are looking into the circularity of their ranges (see below).



I’m yet to see much in the way of organic materials, but perhaps that’s to do with their pricing model. 



And as Everlane works with high quality materials, their use of recycled materials is quite restricted. Right now, their focus is on plastic – they’re committing to eliminating all virgin plastic from their supply chain by 2021, and they announced this change with their ReNew recycled outwear range*.







Is Everlane slow fashion?



Finally, onto slow fashion. Everlane designs modern basics, so their turnover of styles is a lot slower than fast fashion.



As an affiliate of Everlane, I’ve been aware of their changing collections over the past few months. For a popular brand, they release new styles each month, but these tend to rest on their site for months on end.



My classic cream cashmere jumper* that was gifted to me in December 2018 still sits on their site as of writing in May 2019.



Interestingly, they do have lots of seasonal promotions – so they are not quite seasonless – but definitely slower than a typical high street store.







What does Everlane say?



To write this piece, I got in touch with Everlane to ask them four key questions, covering their ethics, sustainability, slow fashion, and circularity:



1. Who makes Everlane’s clothing? Do you ensure your workers are in a safe and healthy environment? If so, how?



Take a look at our factories page as well as [our] press kit, they both give insight into who makes our clothes, how we vet the factories, and  how we make sure they’re safe.



Relevant information from Everlane’s press kit:



Our factory partners work with 17 factories in seven countries. We look for factories that work with premium brands we respect, and more importantly, we look for partners and owners that really respect the people they employ. We visit these factories often and have developed strong, personal relationships with the management.For the past two years, all profits made on Black Friday went directly to improving the lives of the workers at our factories.



2. Do you use sustainable materials?



Our denim and ReNew press releases note some of our sustainable materials. Further information can be found under each product description on the site.



Relevant information from Everlane’s press releases:



Everlane is making a commitment: No virgin plastic in their entire supply chain by 2021.Everlane Denim … is made at the world’s cleanest factory. The water recovery and filtration is so sophisticated, you can actually drink the recycled water.



3. How many seasons does Everlane produce each year?



We produce new product on a monthly basis. 



4. Do you take any post-sale measures to ensure the longevity/circularity of your clothing?



We’re actively looking into this, as we think about sustainability and the lifecycle of our clothing.







Overall…



Everlane is an ethical fashion brand. Sure, they’re not perfect. They could do with offsetting their carbon emissions. Their new stores make me question their competitive online-only approach. But I’m yet to meet even one fashion brand that does absolutely everything right. 



The one thing I really like about Everlane is their commitment – once they’ve set a goal, they fulfil it 100%. Their 2021 ban on virgin plastic covers plastic packaging and plastic at their offices. Their denim is some of the cleanest made in the world. I’m excited to see what they are planning next.



Everlane is moving towards being a sustainable fashion brand. Their ReNew collection and recycled Denim are obviously their showstopper ranges when it comes to sustainability, but they also use a lot of natural materials that have the potential to be recycled. And not just that – they’re wearable, loveable, and high quality. That in itself increases the number of times you want to wear that garment, and I can honestly say my pieces from Everlane are some of my most cherished.



Everlane is a hybrid slow fashion brand. Everlane is seemingly uninterested in producing slow fashion, although they do have a slower level of production compared to the 52 weekly seasons of fast fashion. This may be to do with their careful design process, or their high quality creation, so while they’re not invested in this area they do play into it.







Will I still shop with Everlane?



Yes. There’s still room for improvement, but I like their values, approach, and style. They also seem open to feedback – from their press kit:



“We use the feedback they collect to better plan our products. This research can inform any aspect of production: from before we even design a garment to after you’ve worn it.”



…so if you do want them to work on something, be vocal about it.



One thing’s for sure – Everlane has its heart in the right place. These words from their press kit sum up their attitude perfectly, and I tend to agree:



“It’s our hope—and it’s been our personal experience—that the more people understand about how their products are made and priced, the more thoughtful they will be about what they buy.”

In February, I introduced you to the first steps of the materials scoping study that we completed with the help of The Dragonfly Initiative (TDI). To recap, we reviewed 38 materials found in the Fairphone 2 to gain a better understanding of the social and sustainability issues associated with each of them, plus the opportunities for improvements. If you haven’t already, you may want to go back and read my first materials scoping blog post to learn more about the criteria and how we assessed the materials. Because this can get very technical, be sure to read our Smartphone Material Profiles as well, which we’ve created to make our research more accessible.  Get to know our 10 priority materialsThe first round of analysis helped us to prioritize 10 material supply chains we wanted to further look into. We started by looking at which materials are most used heavily by the consumer electronics industry and how critical they are for phone functionality. We then combined that information with findings from our recycling and mining indicators. As a result, we came up with a shortlist of 10 materials: copper, cobalt, gallium, gold, indium, nickel, tantalum, tin, tungsten, and rare earths.As we went through this process, we uncovered a ton of information about these 10 materials – and we think you’ll find it just as intriguing as we do! To make our research more accessible, we’ve created a special material profiles report that highlights the issues and opportunities related to each.Take a few minutes to browse through the report to learn:Where the materials are found in our phone and in the worldWhere the issues and opportunities areWhat already is being done to address the issuesSo much more!From a top 10 list to a materials road mapWe’re currently diving deeper into each of these materials to carefully examine the various issues and opportunities to drive impact. While the first round of investigation looked at each material in isolation, in this round we’re looking at overlapping geographies and supply chains and presence of the same material in different components to understand where we -from a material perspective- can make the most effective impact. Here’s what we researched:Where is it found in the phone? We want to know which of these materials appear in which components, and if they are especially concentrated in one component. This can help us decide which components (and suppliers) to look at first. It’s also interesting to know if other products and sectors use the exact same component. If so, it may offer a great opportunity to join forces.Use of the 10 materials in the phone, view the full report to read all the details.What are the specific issues? So in other words, what’s issues can be found in each supply chain? We started by looking at the association with environmental and social issues, especially during the mining process. Are there health and safety issues? Water depletion? Toxic waste? We also want to know about the overall material depletion and recycling rates. Together, these indicators can point us to the supply chains that could potentially benefit most from improvements.Where is it being produced? Many of the issues are deeply tied to the countries where the materials are mined. So we’re looking at the mined production levels per country and the contribution that mineral industries make to GDP, as well as the stability of the government, risk of corruption and the ease of doing business there. All of this helps reveal where improvements are most necessary, as well as where they might be too challenging to pursue right now.Global mined production by country, view the full report to read all the details.What’s being done and who can we work with? Finally, we’re looking at opportunities for industry-wide collaboration. Are there already industry associations connecting users and sharing best practices? Or are these not active yet and could they do more to encourage their members to clean up their supply chains? Are there existing supply chain or research initiatives that we can partner with? Greater awareness and established networks make it easier to start making a difference.So what did we learn? Here are a few examplesBy now, you might be a bit overwhelmed by all the methodology behind our materials scoping process. To make things more tangible, let’s look at a few examples of the challenges and opportunities we discovered during this phase of our research.Rare earths: Of this group we researched 3 different elements which appear in components as diverse as the magnets in the speaker and in LCD screens. Besides phones, rare earths are also used by the automotive industry and in “green” technologies like wind-turbines and LED lamps. Mining rare earths comes with a huge range of social and environmental issues, and recycling of these elements is currently almost non-existent.Gold: This mineral has ultra-high depletion rates, meaning that the economically available gold, or the gold that can be dug out of the ground at a reasonable cost, is rapidly decreasing. As the very large surface deposit of gold are mostly gone, it is likely that a greater percentage will come from smaller, often artisanal mines. Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) supports millions of families, but lack of formal oversight also means it could be vulnerable to a range of human rights issues. Therefore, engaging with artisanal gold mining has the potential to make a huge positive impact. Happily, there are multiple initiatives that are already working to improve artisanal gold mining conditions, and there are also a lot of existing options for encouraging recycling.Nickel: Current estimates say that in 350 years, there will be no nickel left to mine. The majority of the world’s production takes place in the Philippines, where several mines have been closed due to environmental concerns like pollution of rivers. On the other hand, high recycling rates offer opportunities to reduce mining activities.Copper: This mineral appears throughout the phone in large volumes and is highly concentrated in components like the PCB. Copper mining is associated with water contamination, environmental degradation and health concerns, as it is often found in combination with arsenic. This article on copper mining in Zambia makes it clear just how many problems can arise.Copper cathodes processed in the DRC.Indium: Many people have never heard of it, but this element appears in tiny quantities in components like the LCD screen. Because it’s a byproduct from the extraction of other materials like lead and zinc, it’s considered quite rare as its supply is dependent on other mineral industries and therefore unstable.This is just a quick impression of all information we are comparing and assessing. More details on our approach and roadmap will be covered in the third blog post in this series. So stay tuned!To make an impact, we’ve got to collaborateAnalyzing these different materials and supply chains has reiterated how complicated the consumer electronics industry is, and we certainly can’t (and don’t want to!) tackle these issues in isolation or by ourselves. So if you’re a brand, manufacturer, supplier, smelter, refiner, non-profit organization or just a super-engaged person already working to improve a specific component or material researched in this scoping study, please get in touch! We’d love to discuss the issues and see how we can collaborate.And in the spirit of collaboration, we’d like to encourage everyone to share*, use and build upon our and TDI’s research. If you have any information that you think could contribute to our materials scoping research or improvement efforts, we’d be very happy if you can let us know. Finally, while we completed this study with the Fairphone 2 in mind, we also see the value of expanding it to a wider range of materials and potentially develop an open source database. If you would be interested in using or co-developing such a database, please add your name to this list and we will contact you when there is enough interest for a follow up.*Note from the editor: As with the rest of our publications, this information falls under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike license.

We are delighted that the Uganda Gold Partnership was recently nominated for the Responsible Business Award 2019 in the category ‘Partnership of the Year’. This partnership is a joint collaboration between Fairphone, Hivos/Stop Child Labour, Fairtrade Foundation, Solidaridad, UNICEF, and Royal Philips to support a more responsible approach to gold sourcing.An ASM goldmine in Busia, Uganda.Leveraging diverse expertise towards a joint goalWe are particularly encouraged to be nominated in this category as the purpose of our partnership is to pioneer a multi-stakeholder, multi-faceted approach to tackle child labor in artisanal and small-scale gold mines (ASM) in Busia, Uganda. Another important goal of the program is to establish a sustainable, traceable gold supply chain that contributes to a better future for miners and their families.Within this partnership, comprised of electronics manufacturers and local and global non-profit organizations, we are able to leverage each other’s unique expertise towards these goals. Our combined effort is invaluable within the scope of this program, as gold mining is a complex field where different challenges can only be tackled through cooperation between a wide range of actors: on a local, national and international level.Our local implementation partners also play an essential role: three ASM mines in Uganda, the local government of Busia and authorities in the implementing areas, EWAD, Nascent, Fairtrade Africa, Solidaridad East and Central Africa, UNICEF, and The Impact Facility.A presentation during the inception meeting with our local partners.Continued progress towards a more responsible ASM gold sectorOur approach is tackling the challenges directly and at their root causes, building partnerships, and piloting scalable solutions on the ground. We hereby work on four distinct levels: community, mine, market, and national level. Active since 2017, the partnership has steadily continued working towards eliminating child labor from ASM gold mining in Uganda, improving working conditions, and ensuring a responsible, traceable gold supply chain.Providing access to necessary investments and formal market channels against gradual improvements of the mine site on social and environmental criteria is an important part of our work as both are essential to provide the economic incentive to enable investment in these improvements.Visiting one of the three selected ASM mines in Uganda.To date, the program has achieved positive results at the community and mine level. We signed memorandums of understandings (MOUs) with three mining cooperatives, committing to gradual improvements against a set of social and environmental criteria against investments in production equipment and market access. At the pilot area of the motivational centers, we have engaged about a quarter of the children identified as being at risk of child labour or already working in gold mines, with the aim of getting them back to school. In addition, the following results were identified so far:Installation of a mercury-free gold processing center and enabling increased production at the mine site to eventually increase income levels and profitability of the mine.Training 15% of miners in business planning, and health and safety regarding mining methods.16 teachers are applying child-friendly classroom teaching methods and reaching more than 800 children with those new methods.12 community mobilizers are working with the communities on identifying children at risk of child labor and children out of school. They are working on getting the children back to school or to the motivational centers, and talking to the community members during gatherings and meetings about the risks of child labor and the value of education.Forming two village saving groups with 45 families, hereby working towards reducing the risk that children from low-income families resort to becoming involved in gold mining labor.Joining forces for more responsible gold mining.Join usWith the Uganda Gold Partnership, we seek to set an example for the gold industry that illustrates the positive impact that can be created in joint effort and cooperation. Such positive impact is only truly sustainable when there is sufficient engagement from all parties involved in the gold supply chain as well as from the communities and local governments.We hereby invite you to join us in our work towards a responsible gold supply chain. Examples of involvement include:Purchasing responsible gold from the mines involved in the program.Making funds available for investment in the mines involved in the program.Actively support the integration of the gold from these mines into your own supply chain.You can find more information on this program in our joint Uganda Gold Partnership program overview.// Image credits: Solidaridad"ÿÿUganda Gold Partnership nominated for Responsible Business Award 2019 - Fairphone

Every material in your smartphone has its own story to tell. Since Fairphone began, we’ve been helping to shed light on those stories, by mapping our supply chain, tracking what’s used in our products and making step-by-step improvements. Gold is one of our key focus materials – an essential, but problematic material for the electronics industry.Gold’s scarcity and unique properties make it one of the world’s most valuable metalsBut gold mining poses a wide variety of social and environmental challenges, such as land disputes, unfair pricing, unsafe working conditions, child labor and pollution. In the transition towards a circular economy, it is key to decrease our dependence on mining. At this moment, however, 75% of the world’s gold supply is mined, with 90% of the miners working in artisanal mines. That means an estimated 15 to 20 million people relying on artisanal gold for their daily income and livelihoods. As it will take the world decades – if not more – to fully meet the demand for gold through recycling, the industry will stay heavily reliant on mined gold. So while we need to put efforts into increasing recycling, such as through our take-back programs for old electronics, it is critical to ensure the mining sector improves and that people work under humane conditions and/or are supported in a transition towards other, more sustainable livelihoods.Our first step in integrating Fairtrade gold in our Fairphone 2 supply chainOur journey to include responsible gold in our supply chain started with the Fairphone 2. With the help of our partners AT&S (our printed circuit board supplier),Valcambi (one of the world’s largest precious metal refiners) and Fairtrade, we set up our first pilot Fairtrade gold supply chain. Fairtrade is an organization that monitors and ensures higher social and environmental standards through certification, producer support, programs and advocacy. Tracing the gold used in the Fairphone 2.In order to bring the Fairtrade certified gold from the mine to the market, we used the Fairtrade mass-balance sourcing model. This means gold mined in a more responsible fashion from the certified mine remains segregated until leaving the refinery, allowing it to be audited for its Fairtrade license. We then bought this Fairtrade gold from the refiner, and shipped the gold amount needed for the production of the Fairphone 2 directly to our component manufacturer. The certified gold was then mixed (mass balanced) with non-certified gold sourced by the component manufacturer to supply a larger spectrum of clients.While this means the Fairtrade gold doesn’t necessarily end up in your specific product, mass-balancing the gold is critical. Using certified gold that is fully segregated from mine to mobile phone incurs significant operational and logistical costs along the entire supply chain. Using mass balance is necessary to keep costs down to allow the reach and on-the-ground impact of the program to expand over time. And more importantly, it still delivers the same benefits and positive impact for the miners. (For additional information about traceability and related models, you can read this detailed report published by the United Nations Global Compact.Scaling up responsible gold sourcing with the Fairphone 3Ensuring that the innovations we pilot are scalable is key to our mission: the more they can be replicated throughout the industry, the more positive impact will be generated. In order to ensure this gold sourcing model is scalable enough for wider industry adaptation, we realized that we needed to mass balance the gold even earlier in the supply chain: right after leaving the refinery. For Fairphone to buy the gold directly from the refiner and subsequently shipping the gold straight to component suppliers changed the supply chain too much: it was too complicated, more costly and operationally inefficient as all suppliers based in China source through the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE).Thanks to extensive discussion and creative thinking with Fairtrade and Valcambi, as well as our supply chain partners, we developed a model we believe fits the average electronics supply chain: Our scalable Fairtrade gold sourcing model.By mass balancing the gold earlier in the supply chain and paying the premium directly to the refinery but allowing the Fairtrade gold to be sold and shipped as ‘regular’ gold through the exchange, we are able to increase the amount of Fairtrade gold we are buying, connecting it to even more component manufacturers sourcing their gold through the SGE, and ultimately impacting even more people!Join us in building a fairer future togetherIt is entirely possible to grow the amount of Fairtrade gold sourced worldwide in the coming years. For the Fairphone 3, we currently have three suppliers sourcing our Fairtrade gold through the SGE. Previously, we have bought an average of 100 grams of Fairtrade gold per year, but our new, scalable approach means that we now aim to grow that amount to one kilogram of Fairtrade gold per year (in fact, we have already bought 500g in the first half of 2019). And with this improved scalable model, it also becomes much easier for other industry players to source Fairtrade gold as well.  Ensuring demand, however, is only one side of the spectrum. ensuring the supply of certified gold keeps up with increased demand is also vital. For this to happen, the sector needs extensive and thoughtful investment to get more artisanal gold mines up to the standard of Fairtrade mining practices. That’s why we are actively working with our partners Fairtrade, Solidaridad, UNICEF, The Impact Facility, Philips and Hivos/ Stop Child Labour, to support miners in improving mining practices in East Africa, specifically in Uganda. By working together, it’s possible to create long-term improvements across the entire industry.With more industry players sourcing through this model, a larger group of miners will benefit.  Miners will see that there is a worthwhile market for responsibly produced gold. We therefore warmly welcome any other electronics manufacturer interested in sourcing Fairtrade gold to contact us >"ÿÿScaling up Fairtrade gold sourcing in our supply chain - Fairphone

Just a couple months ago in April, I went to the DRC together with team member Sylvain, to continue our quest for more responsibly mined materials. This time was all about cobalt, a critical material we need to produce our battery. For some part, we were joined by a documentary crew that is following us for several months to show our work as an alternative way of doing business. See a short excerpt of our time in Congo.During the trip, we were able to see many steps of the cobalt supply chain and talk to different local and international parties. Thanks to the help of GIZ (German Development Cooperation) and BGR (Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources) as well as the Congolese IDAK (Investissement Durable au Katanga) for organizing the on-site visits and workshop. And it was even a trip down memory lane, as Fairphone first visited the southern province Katanga in 2011 when we existed only as an awareness-raising campaign. This second time around we had an actual phone to show off and a concrete objective – to find opportunities to source cobalt and to make our battery more fair.Visiting various cobalt minesFlying over the provincial capital Lubumbashi, we saw a great extended city of around four million inhabitants, more than four times Amsterdam, in the middle of a beautiful green lush landscape. Still, the area is a not so popular travel destination, as almost all other passengers left the plane one stop earlier, in Zambia.The Katanga province is known for its enormous reserves of copper and cobalt, more than 50% of the global mined cobalt production comes from the DRC (read more in our material scoping study). We visited various types of mines, ranging from purely manually operated artisanal sites – to more advanced industrial ones, also called large-scale mining. Compared to the eastern Kivu provinces (where we sourced tin and tantalum), Katanga has a much larger share of industrial mining, here only a small part of the production, about 15-20% is coming from the artisanal- and small scale mining (ASM) sites. This still encompasses an estimated number of 70,000 to more than 100,000 artisanal miners.Differences between artisanal and industrial miningOn this trip, we saw striking differences between artisanal and industrial mines. Artisanal mining sites have little to no equipment used, no protective gear, and unsafe conditions such as tunnels that are not safely built. Further, these artisanal miners are mining often illegally on land designated for industrial mining organizations and therefore get into disputes with large-scale mining companies on the right to work in these areas. Artisanal miners do not work in the land designated for artisanal mining because they claim this land is not as rich in resources as the land for large-scale mining.A mine site using artisanal mining practices. Only the pits with orange tents are active.In comparison, the industrial mining sites we visited had much better equipment and were better organized. (We even had to do alcohol tests before entering the sites!). On first glance, it may seem like industrial mining is the preferred solution to improve the lives of local mining communities. However, artisanal mining results in a direct income to their families and local communities, as opposed to large-scale mining which employs fewer people and most income goes to the government or foreign companies.On-site at an industrial (or large-scale) copper mine.All in all, it became all too clear that the situation is very complex and that there is no one obvious right answer for the fairest cobalt.Further up the supply chainBesides mine sites, we were able to observe additional stages in the supply chain for opportunities of improvement before cobalt leaves the DRC.There are multiple marketplaces or depots, where traders buy directly from the mineworkers or from middle-men. We didn’t see a traceability scheme in place, so at this point it becomes difficult to say from which site the cobalt originates. The depots have tools to determine the quality of the ore, but offer little insight to the miners on how this grade and the prices paid are determined. The miners do not have much of a bargaining position and must take the price offered, which miners suspect to be far below the actual market prices. Here there could be better ways for miners to negotiate the value of the ore they mine.Police des Mines are present at the mine site.Then we also visited a local concentrator, where the cobalt ore is separated from the copper and is purified into a higher grade of cobalt. Entering the facility, we could instantly feel the heat of the ovens heating up to 1,400 C and we could smell the strong use of chemicals in the process. After this stage, the cobalt concentrate is shipped to other countries to be refined into pure cobalt metal.Workshop with local and international stakeholdersTogether with two German development organizations BGR and GIZ as well as the Congolese IDAK, we co-organized a two-day workshop in Lubumbashi. In this workshop, we discussed the practices and issues we had seen on our on-site visits and discuss with other stakeholders whether there were any shared opinions on possible solutions as well as existing programs already happening on the ground which could be linked to. About 40 local and international parties attended, including government authorities, mining cooperatives, individual miners and NGOs.There are currently various initiatives starting on cobalt in the DRC and we wanted to take this opportunity to discuss them with relevant stakeholders on the ground. With the world demand for cobalt on the rise and many communities still highly dependent on a very problematic mining sector, it becomes more and more urgent that a transitional strategy is being developed and implemented.Discussing ways forwardA real change requires all stakeholders to come together and to get a shared understanding of the most pressing issues and the existing challenges to address them. A number of improvements for the artisanal mining sector were proposed, such as addressing issues like legal rights to land for mining, traceability, improving health and safety and increasing income for miners and their communities.We also identified opportunities, some of which are already happening like local concentrators (mentioned above) that are directing significant efforts to get a more transparent supply chain and are training local miners on the need for more responsible practices. Also there are already some great initiatives on-the-ground addressing child labor which could be expanded.Cobalt is freshly washed at the mine site.This on-site visit and workshop gave us a valuable insight in the local challenges and it was encouraging to see that so many actions are already being taken. It also gave us the opportunity to meet many potential partners with whom we will keep on exploring how we can make the cobalt supply chain fairer and connect our battery supply chain to it. At the same time, we continue to call upon our battery supplier and sub-suppliers to research the route of cobalt to our battery. This trip has helped us to provide more information to suppliers and partners in our supply chain and to encourage them to support us in finding more responsible alternatives.Now it’s your turn!

        “You can take any issue – overtime, low wages, health issues, forced labour – and you will find this in the supply chain of electronics,” says Dr Peter Pawlicki of industry watchdog Electronics Watch.
The electronics industry is now one of the largest and most lucrative in the world. Some 18 million workers toil to make gadgets that amount to 20 per cent of global imports and a $1.7tn (£1.4tn) annual trade – and it’s a trade that is set to keep on growing.
“This industry is very cyclical. there are ups and downs driven by seasons and new launches so you have a need for a hugely flexible workforce,” says Pawlicki, director of outreach and education at the independent watchdog. All this has led to excessive overtime, precarious employment, debt bondage, poor health and safety, and even child labour.

Starting as an awareness campaign in the Netherlands in 2013, founder Bas van Abel decided that in order to bring about change, he had to do it from within the industry.
So, the phone company began to integrate conflict-free minerals into the supply chain of its smartphones. “There are 40 to 60 minerals in a phone so we wanted to look at where we could have the most impact,” explains Luke James, head of sales and partnerships at Fairphone.

        Taking one component at a time, the Fairphone team has been working with charities and government bodies on the ground to verify that the minerals they source come from mines that operate safely and ethically. The company now buys its tantalum and tin – conflict-free – from the Democratic Republic of Congo and tungsten from Rwanda.
Fairphone also uses recycled plastic for the casing and Fairtrade gold, and the team is in the process of finding – and verifying – a source for conflict-free lithium and cobalt.
The company designs for longevity, easy repair, and modular upgrades. Its goal is to make phone hardware last as long as possible, and to provide the support to keep people’s phone software up to date too.

        Meanwhile, Fairphone’s handsets – now in their third iteration – are made in a factory in China, to which the brand has gone directly to ask workers about their needs – responses included a better canteen. Then, Fairphone offered the factory a financial incentive if these needs are met.
“We asked the workforce what they wanted. It’s not the most normal approach but, for us, we’ll only be able to bring about improvements by talking to the people who we want to make improvements for,” says James. Fairphone and the factory’s owner, Arima, have now committed to investing $100,000 (£80,200) each year for three years on factory improvements based on employees’ input.

        It is this dedication to workers’ rights that makes Fairphone an obvious tech partner for ethical mobile network The Phone Co-op, which has partnered with Fairphone since the latter’s launch. As the only telecoms co-operative in the UK, The Phone Co-op says it is committed to creating a business that works for everyone.
As more people wake up to the impact their consumer choices have, the better the chance of changing the status quo. “It’s a step-by-step process. But as our brand and community grow, the more bargaining power we’ll have in the industry and the more power to affect the conditions people work under,” James says. “With a company like Fairphone, it’s possible to have a positive impact and bring about change.”

    



                    
    		
            
        Tracing tea with technology
From a farmer in a field in Africa picking fresh tea leaves, to a florist in Aberdeen enjoying one of the 165m cuppas that Brits drink every day, the global supply chain for tea is vast.
An experiment with tea producers using blockchain technology has been hailed by those involved as a model for increasing the sustainability of global supply chains without driving up production costs.
Blockchain is a ‘distributed ledger’ – a reliable electronic record – which is shared between many parties. Concluding in August after an 18-month trial, set up by the University of Cambridge’s Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL), the blockchain system, Trado, was used to record and trace information about tea farmers in Malawi.
CISL worked with a consortium including Unilever, Sainsbury’s, banks and tech startups, to offer the farmers lower interest rates on loans to fund their production costs. In return, the farmers fed social or ecological data into the blockchain. This information was then used to make the tea, and the circumstances in which it was produced, more traceable.

				How long have you been using your current smartphone? The answer for an increasing number of consumers is years, plural. After all, why upgrade every year when next year’s model is almost exactly the same as the device you’re holding in your hand?
Dutch social enterprise Fairphone  sees this as an opportunity to sell sustainability. A chance to turn a conversation about ‘stalled smartphone innovation’ on its head by encouraging consumers to think more critically about the costs involved in pumping out the next shiny thing. And sell them on the savings — individual and collective — of holding their staple gadget steady.
Its latest smartphone, the Fairphone 3 — just released this week in Europe — represents the startup’s best chance yet of shrinking the convenience gap between the next hotly anticipated touchscreen gizmo and a fairer proposition that requires an altogether cooler head to appreciate.
On the surface Fairphone 3 looks like a fairly standard, if slightly thick (1cm), Android  smartphone. But that’s essentially the point. This 4G phone could be your smartphone, is the intended message.

Specs wise, you’re getting mostly middling, rather than stand out stuff. There’s a 5.7in full HD display, a Qualcomm  Snapdragon 632 chipset, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (expandable via microSD), a 12MP rear lens and 8MP front-facing camera. There’s also NFC on board, a fingerprint reader, dual nano-SIM slots and a 3,000mAh battery that can be removed for easy replacement when it wears out.
There’s also a 3.5mm headphone jack: The handy port that’s being erased at the premium smartphone tier,  killing off a bunch of wired accessories with it. So ‘slow replacement’ smartphone hardware demonstrably encourages less waste across the gadget ecosystem too.
But the real difference lies under the surface. Fairer here means supply chain innovation to source conflict-free minerals that go into making the devices. social incentive programs that top up the minimum wages of assembly workers who put the phones together. and repairable, modular handset design that’s intended to reduce environmental impact by supporting a longer lifespan. Repair, don’t replace is the mantra.
All the extra effort that goes into making a smartphone less ethically challenging to own is of course invisible to the naked eye. So the Fairphone 3 buyer largely has to take the company’s word on trust.
The only visual evidence is repairability. Flip the phone over and a semi-opaque plastic backing gives a glimpse of modular guts. A tiny screwdriver included in the box allows you take the phone to pieces so you can swap out individual modules (such as the display) in case they break or fail. Fairphone sells replacements via a spare parts section of its website.

Despite this radically modular and novel design vs today’s hermetically sealed premium mobiles the Fairphone 3 feels extremely solid to hold.
It’s not designed to pop apart easily. Indeed, there’s a full thirteen screws holding the display module in place. Deconstruction takes work (and care not to lose any of the teeny screws). So this is modularity purely as occasional utility, not flashy party trick — as with Google’s doomed Ara Project.
For some that might be disappointing. Exactly because this modular phone feels so, well, boringly normal.
Visually the most stand out feature at a glance is the Fairphone logo picked out in metallic white lettering on the back. Those taking a second look will also spot a moralizing memo printed on the battery so it’s legible through the matte plastic — which reads: “Change is in your hands”. It may be a bit cringeworthy but if you’ve paid for an ethical premium you might as well flaunt it.
It’s fair to say design fans won’t be going wild over the Fairphone 3. But it feels almost intentionally dull. As if — in addition to shrinking manufacturing costs — the point is to impress on buyers that ethical internals are more than enough of a hipster fashion statement.
It’s also true that most smartphones are now much the same, hardware, features and performance wise. So — at this higher mid-tier price-point (€450/~$500) — why not flip the consumer smartphone sales pitch on its head to make it about shrinking rather than maximizing impact, via a dull but worthy standard?
That then pushes people to ask how sustainable is an expensive but valueless — and so, philosophically speaking, pointless — premium? That’s the question Fairphone 3 seems designed to pose.
Or, to put it another way, if normal can be ethical then shouldn’t ethical electronics be the norm?
Normal is what you get elsewhere with Fairphone 3. Purely judged as a smartphone its performance isn’t anything to write home about. It checks all the usual boxes of messaging, photos, apps and Internet browsing. You can say it gets the job done.
Sure, it’s not buttery smooth at every screen and app transition. And it can feel a little slow on the uptake at times. Notably the camera, while fairly responsive, isn’t lightning quick. Photo quality is not terrible — but not amazing either.
Testing the camera I found images prone to high acutance and over saturated colors. The software also struggles to handle mixed light and shade — meaning you may get a darker and less balanced shot that you hoped for. Low light performance isn’t great either.
That said, in good light the Fairphone 3 can take a perfectly acceptable selfie. Which is what most people will expect to be able to use the phone for.
Fairphone has said it’s done a lot of work to improve the camera vs the predecessor model. And it has succeeded in bringing photo performance up to workable standard — which is a great achievement at what’s also a slightly reduced handset price-point. Though, naturally, there’s still a big gap in photo quality vs the premium end of the smartphone market.
On the OS front, the phone runs a vanilla implementation of Android 9 out of the box — preloaded with the usual bundle of Google services and no added clutter so Android fans should feel right at home. (For those who want a Google-free alternative Fairphone says a future update will allow users to do a wipe and clean install of Android Open Source Project.)

In short, purely as a smartphone, the Fairphone 3 offers very little to shout about — so no screaming lack either. Again, if the point is to shrink the size of the compromise Fairphone is asking consumers to make in order to buy an ethically superior brand of electronics they are slowly succeeding in closing the gap.
It’s a project that’s clearly benefiting from the maturity of the smartphone market. While, on the cellular front, the transformative claims being made for 5G are clearly many years out — so there’s no issue with asking buyers to stick with a 4G phone for years to come.
Given where the market has now marched to, a ‘fairer’ smartphone that offers benchmark basics at a perfectly acceptable median but with the promise of reduced costs over the longer term — individual, societal and environmental — does seem like a proposition that could expand from what has so far been an exceptional niche into something rather larger and more mainstream.
Zooming out for a second, the Fairphone certainly makes an interesting contrast with some of the expensive chimeras struggling to be unfolded at the top end of the smartphone market right now.
Foldables like the Samsung Galaxy Fold — which clocks in at around 4x the price of a Fairphone and offers ~2x the screen real estate (when unfolded), plus a power bump. Whether the Fold’s lux package translates into mobile utility squared is a whole other question, though.
And where foldables will need to demonstrate a compelling use-case that goes above and beyond the Swiss Army utility of a normal smartphone to justify such a whopping price bump, Fairphone need only prick the consumer conscience — as it asks you pay a bit more and settle for a little less.
Neither of these sales pitches is challenge free, of course. And, for now, both foldables and fairer electronics remain curious niches.
But with the Fairphone 3 demonstrating that ethical can feel so normal it doesn’t seem beyond the pale to imagine demand for electronics that are average in performance yet pack an ethical punch scaling up to challenge the mainstream parade of copycat gadgets.

Project Update, 14 June 2018: We’re continuing to make progress with responsible cobalt sourcing, and are excited to announce that we’ve expanded our partnership as lighting company Signify (formerly known as Philips Lighting) has joined our efforts!Together, we’ll continue working to connect cobalt from artisanal mine sites that meet baseline standards to our battery supply chains, sourced through Huayou Cobalt. In addition, we’ll collaborate to develop programs that focus on health and safety and fairer incomes for local artisanal miners as well as monitor progress towards more responsible mining practices. As a first step, we’re joining forces with the Better Cobalt program to initiate monitoring at selected mine sites. This will give us more insight into the issues miners face and help us develop a clear road map for improvements. We’re very pleased with the latest developments in this project and will keep you posted as soon as we have more news to share.Cobalt is an essential material used in high-performance lithium-ion batteries, used in everything from laptops and smartphones to electric and hybrid cars. As our appetite for these products continues to grow, the demand for cobalt is growing along with it.  Today, Amnesty International published a report about human rights abuses in Congolese cobalt mines. One of the takeaways from the report is that the so-called “tech giants” – including mainly the electronics and automotive industries – differ in the extent in which they’re mapping their cobalt supply chains. However, there hasn’t been much change in the conditions at the mine sites.Miners in DRC showing minerals after two days in the mine pit. (April 2017)Instead of turning away from regions with a high risk, Fairphone’s approach has always been to work with areas where we can have the greatest impact. To support economic development and encourage responsible mining practices in the DRC and beyond, we’re partnering with a variety of initiatives to set up transparent supply chains for the essential minerals used in our phones. We believe abandoning small-scale mining can exacerbate existing problems, since it is a crucial source of income for many local communities.Recently, we agreed to join hands with refiner Huayou Cobalt, to start setting-up a traceable supply chain with cobalt originating from a selection of artisanal and small-scale mine-sites (ASM) in the DRC and to directly work with these sites to improve working conditions.Paving the way for better cobaltWhy do we focus on cobalt? As part of the Fairphone journey to improve mineral sourcing, cobalt has always been close to our hearts. Back in 2011, before Fairphone became a social enterprise, we took our first trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to visit cobalt mines and learn more about the working conditions. Following our materials scoping study, we’ve selected cobalt as one of our top 10 materials to focus on while producing our Fairphones. Our most recent cobalt research trip to the DRC took place in April this year, to see what is currently the status of the situation in the mines.Global cobalt sourcing percentage by country, based on our materials scoping study.Even though cobalt is not classified as a ‘conflict mineral’, the mining conditions are often associated with severe human rights violations, including child labor. At the same time, it is currently not possible to fully substitute cobalt in electronics nor is there enough supply of recycled cobalt, which means mining will remain the basic source of supply in the near future. Actions to improve the mining sector are therefore urgent.For Fairphone, contributing to the formalisation and improvement of the sector seems to be a more sustainable solution. Over the past six years, we’ve seen slow but steady changes in the public debate surrounding cobalt – both in terms of consumer and industry mindset, as well as a willingness to make concrete changes.Setting up a traceable cobalt supply chain from the DRCWe are currently working on setting up a new battery supply chain for the Fairphone 2. While doing so, we specifically look for like-minded partners and have discussions about opening up the cobalt supply chain from an early stage onwards in detailing the partnership. At the same time, we’re building relationships in Congo on the ground, to see what are possible best practices that we can support and connect to our supply chain.Processed cobalt oxide ready for export through Durban, South Africa. (April 2017)In this process, we’re also in conversations with Huayou Cobalt, a major global cobalt refiner, who is taking steps to directly source from a selection of cobalt mines in the DRC to be able to increase transparency and better monitor the working conditions. To move beyond the untraceable ‘black box’, they want to cut out the middleman in order to gain as much control as possible over where the cobalt comes from, by purchasing cobalt directly from the mines.To support their efforts to keep making improvements, Fairphone has agreed to work together to identify a selection of artisanal mine sites to connect the cobalt that Huayou would be sourcing to the battery of the Fairphone 2. This doesn’t mean that these mines are already perfect, but they would need to meet a baseline set of criteria, including ensuring that the mines are legally registered, have systems in place to prevent child labor, and that the cobalt can be directly traced to the individual mine.In addition, we have committed to be working together directly with selected mines to further improve health and safety and the miner’s ability to generate a fair income. The aim is to outline a clear roadmap and continuously improve the conditions at these mines.All progress is worth celebratingFairphone can’t create systemic change on its own and we are pro-actively inviting other industry players to join us. There are concrete signs of commitments from other brands to partner with us in setting up this new supply chain and we will keep you updated as we go further. In addition to focusing on our own supply chain, we’ll continue to follow the progress of initiatives such as the Responsible Cobalt Initiative (RCI).While we’re under no illusion that we can change how cobalt is mined and sourced overnight, we want to offer real solutions, and a real path to improvement, one step at a time. Because we believe that all improvements represent progress, no matter how small they might be."ÿÿA closer look at our efforts to improve cobalt sourcing - Fairphone

Dutch social enterprise Fairphone has released a new version of its ""ethical"" smartphone that is designed to be easily taken apart for repairs.The Fairphone 3 eschews glue in favour of screws and a unibody handset in favour of a modular design, in a bid to cut down on e-waste and improve the life cycle of electronics.It sets itself apart from Apple's iPhone and other leading smartphones on the market, which have been criticised for the increasing impenetrability that makes them difficult to recycle.This is the third iteration of the Fairphone, and the company promises a refined design that is more reliable and durable as well as slimmer than previous models.Its goal is that customers should keep the phone for five years or more, removing any faulty module for replacement or repair.By encouraging customers to keep their devices for longer, the company reduces the carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing and shipping.Fairphone thinks in terms of social as well as environmental sustainability. The company operates several initiatives it dubs ""fair specs"", which aim to make its supply chain fairer.To improve the conditions of workers, it has collaborated with manufacturer Arima, in whose factory the products are assembled, to increase pay, representation, health and safety.When it comes to materials, Fairphone uses responsibly sourced and conflict-free tin and tungsten, recycled copper and plastics, and Fairtrade gold.The company is also exploring possibilities for the ""better sourcing"" of cobalt, which is currently mined in hazardous conditions, sometimes by children.Although in one sense the company is a competitor to Apple, Samsung and other tech giants, Fairphone's CEO Eva Gouwens says its goal is to change practices across the electronics industry.""We developed the Fairphone 3 to be a real sustainable alternative on the market, which is a big step towards lasting change,"" she Gouwens.""By establishing a market for ethical products, we want to motivate the entire industry to act more responsibly since we cannot achieve this change alone,"" she added.The Fairphone 3's specs are similar to mid-level smartphones on the market today, incorporating a 5.7-inch display with Gorilla Glass, a 12-megapixel rear camera and an eight-megapixel front camera.The phone also features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 processor and 3000 milliamp hour (mAh) battery.The battery is removable, as are the other six of the phone's modules. A ""teardown"" conducted by website iFixit shows the reviewer removing the back with their fingers and the modules with a Phillips-head screwdriver.Inside, the connectors and modules are labelled to assist with re-assembly, and small graphics such as a map of the Democratic Republic of Congo serve to remind tinkerers of the product's supply chain.Most of the components inside the modules are replaceable too, although a few are glued on.The Fairphone is the key modular smartphone on the market since Google shelved Project Ara in 2016.The company released the first Fairphone in 2013 and followed up with mark two in 2016. Although neither were huge sellers, the Fairphone 3 arguably arrives at a time of increased consumer interest in ethical products.Last year design duo Formafantasma presented Ore Streams, a two-year research project into e-waste, using the opportunity to ask designers to consider recyclability as integral to good designAnother company committed to disassemblable electronics is Kano, which aims to educate kids on how to take apart their tech."ÿÿ"Fairphone 3 promises to be ""real sustainable alternative"" to regular smartphones"

Tessa Wernink reveals what you need to make it in the social sector apart from good intentionsIn the beginningThere’s meant to be no such thing as a stupid question, but judging by her reaction to my innocent inquiry, Tessa Wernink doesn’t agree. “Why did I join Fairphone?”, she laughs. “There was no Fairphone when I came here.” What she joined in 2013 was a group of people determined to change the world. “We started out as a campaign raising awareness about the use of conflict minerals in electronics,” Tessa recalls, “but it quickly became apparent that even once you raise awareness of this issue, there was no ‘fair’ alternative on the market for people to buy.”“Fairphone has become a family for a lot of people here. It’s quite natural as we’re all like-minded individuals who share a set of values.”The next step was forming a social enterprise to bring an android phone to market that was made with respect for people and the planet. The first signs weren’t terribly promising: on Tessa’s first day, not only was there no Fairphone, there wasn’t anybody else in the office either. “Although Bas and Miguel, the other two co-founders, had sent me a bunch of flowers, which was nice,” she recalls with another laugh.Since that rather lonely beginning, not only has the Fairphone been brought to life, but it’s also been succeeded by the Fairphone 2, the world’s first modular smartphone. More than 130,000 Fairphones have been sold to date, but perhaps more significant for Tessa is the fact that she doesn’t have to sit on her own any more. Fairphone’s burgeoning reputation has attracted people from all over the world to join the club. “We now have almost 60 people from 22 countries working here, who speak 18 languages,” says Tessa. “But the language we all work in is English, which I think is attractive to a lot of non-Dutch people.”An international familyCommunicating in a shared language has helped engender a strong bond amongst the Fairphoners, who have built up strong relationships in- and outside the office. “Fairphone has become a family for a lot of people here. It’s quite natural as we’re all like-minded individuals who share a set of values. People who join us from abroad often come here on their own, so they don’t have existing groups of friends and are really open to connecting on different levels. We all believe that we can make a change and want to work together for something more than simply security of income.”It was never a deliberate strategy to recruit from abroad, although Fairphone’s goal of raising international awareness of its mission, together with a strong customer support ethos, means that it’s worked out quite nicely. “We ship all over Europe, so it’s important to attract people with language skills to customer support, but I think we simply have a cross-border attraction. In my team of seven, for example, there’s only one other Dutch person. There are just a lot of people who really love Fairphone and keep on sending messages and emails asking to start working here.”“The ideal Fairphoner”However, getting a job at Fairphone isn’t as simple as just telling them that you love the company. “Of course we look for a connection to our mission and values (being open, collaborative, creative and positive), but it’s really important that people are good at their jobs — and flexible, too. Things in a growing enterprise don’t always go to plan so our team needs to be flexible and resilient and creative in how to move forward when things change at the last minute.”So what other qualities make someone the ideal ‘Fairphoner’? “If one’s a woman, of course,” Tessa says with a smile. “No, I’m just kidding, although it’s really great to see that we have a good balance of gender, especially for a tech company. The answer to that question is the same for us as any company: if two candidates have similar skills, experience and connection to mission, that’s a luxury position for us and constitutes a difficult choice. We usually discuss this with other people who have been part of the interview process. It might be related to language skills or an ability to start work soon or move to The Netherlands. It’s no longer down to just what does, or doesn’t, make a Fairphoner.”“To work here, or in this sector, you need to feel a connection with the purpose we have as a company, not just the product.”Instead it’s down to a balance of skills and passion that varies per department. “Some roles attract a lot more people with relevant backgrounds and expertise, others are more difficult. It depends on how far the idea of sustainability has moved in certain sectors. More choice in prospective employees is wonderful, but we still can’t always offer the same benefits as other companies.”However, there aren’t many people who come purely for the weekly yoga lessons and free Fairphones offered as employee perks. “I have yet to meet someone who just came here for the job,” Tessa affirms. “It’s not like having a communications job in a phone company. To work here, or in this sector, you need to feel a connection with the purpose we have as a company, not just the product.”A purpose-driven companyI’m curious as to how Tessa feels Fairphone differs from the rest of the ‘sector’ — and again her answer focuses on identifying the fact that Fairphone is a purpose-driven company. “Most people here have a drive that comes from identifying with the company’s purpose. Whether you talk to software people, industrial designers, logistics, customer support, communications, sales, everyone wants to see the ‘system change’ that Fairphone stands for — an economy based on fairer principles — and see how they can further that within their line of work. Sometimes that means they don’t see the difference between work and their own time, nor does it always make it easy, because people are passionate, but it does make it fun and inspiring.”Having everyone united behind the same goal doesn’t necessarily make it easier to get things done. The opposite, in fact. “The more people care, the harder it can be (sometimes) to make decisions. People are passionate and have a clear vision of which particular way they want to go — but that doesn’t mean we all agree on the direction we’re going, how to get there. There’s a continuous debate between how we promote our phone and our story. It’s only logical, as nobody has scaled up a social enterprise in the tech sector before, so we’re figuring it together out as we go.”Running a social enterpriseThis is the reality of life as a social enterprise, an organisation that uses a commercial model to make social impact. “Our business model is based on selling products. products that bring the buyers closer to knowing what the impact of their purchase is. So the Fairphone stands for what we believe in, but it’s also just a phone. Does that make us a phone company or a social impact company?”On a day-to-day level, this debate requires a more integrated approach to decision making. “We have to consider costs in more than just financial terms. As a result, we need to discuss issues that might be more straightforward for organisations that always choose the path that provides the most revenue.”“Our phone is a platform that can pull together people with different ideas who can contribute to a bigger truth.”As I begin to ask what the consequences are for future investment or expenses, Tessa stops me mid-sentence. “There might be a misconception that as a social enterprise we don’t operate like a ‘normal’ business, but that’s not true. In many ways, most of the choices we have are the same — we still need to make money and sell phones — but the outcome and the goals are different. Our focus is investing in social innovation, instead of purely technical innovation. When other phone companies design a new phone, they research new technology — we research supply chain improvement.”A fair supply chainGiven the closeness of the Fairphone family in Amsterdam, I ask Tessa whether this means that improving the supply chain entails having closer relationships with the people on the ground spread around the rest of the world too. It turns out not be completely necessary. “Well, not everybody is in touch with everyone else, but like any tech company, people here work directly with the suppliers. We have someone permanently based near the factory in China and we have people visiting projects in Rwanda and Peru, for example, who go there regularly. We don’t usually set up the supply chain, but join initiatives that do.”That’s the thing: as Tessa readily admits, not everything about Fairphone is perfect yet, and the quest to create fair supply chains, to know exactly what goes into our phone, where it’s made and who is involved, remains a work in progress. “From the start, we’ve been very honest about what we can and can’t do. It’s almost an open source approach: if we put it out there, we can innovate and show what the best practice is, where we failed and where we succeeded, and other companies starting up as social enterprises can learn from our mistakes or achievements.”Determination and positivityI’m struck by something that Tessa said to me earlier: “Our phone is a platform that can pull together people with different ideas who can contribute to a bigger truth.” It took me a while to realise, but it’s not just Fairphoners she meant, but people who buy the phone, turn up to the events, share blog articles or larger companies who join the movement. Before I leave, I ask Tessa what she believes what is rooted in Fairphone culture that will help it achieve its goals. She doesn’t hesitate for a second. “Determination and positivity.

Last week Thursday, Members of the European Parliament voted with a great majority for the new legislation on the responsible sourcing of four conflict minerals: tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. Because this topic is at the heart of our goals, I wanted to briefly look at the new law, its wider implications and what it means for Fairphone.What is included in the EU conflict mineral legislation?The main objective of the EU conflict mineral legislation is to stop the financing of armed groups and human rights abuses caused by the mineral trade. The new law requires mandatory due diligence checks for importers of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold from conflict and high-risk areas. While the Dodd-Frank Act applied to publicly traded companies, the European law applies to importers of the 3T’s and gold, so not to the end-users (ie. brands like us) as importers are closer to the source of the minerals. Authorities in each EU member state will be responsible for ensuring that these checks are completed in accordance with OECD guidelines. The law will come into force after the council approves, except for the main articles specifying the due diligence requirements, which will only apply from January 2021 (see relevant documentation from the European Commission).Team member Laura Gerritsen onsite at a conflict-free tungsten mine in Rwanda.The EU law concerns the same four minerals as identified in the Dodd-Frank Act, but has a much wider geographical scope. For example, Dodd-Frank defines conflict minerals as coming from only the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries. In contrast, the EU law is taking a global approach, and includes conflict and high- risk zones worldwide. The law, however, excludes small importers from the due diligence requirements, which has the potential to create quite a reporting loophole.The risk of mandatory reporting is that companies, in this case importers, completely stop doing business in these regions, negatively affecting the exact same areas the law is trying to help. Recognizing this, the final legislation will be accompanied by other measures to ensure the law is effective and has a positive effect on the ground. For example, a list of responsible smelters and refiners will be published annually by the EU, specifically mentioning parties that source responsibly from conflict and high risk areas. The list should incentivize trade with these areas. The EU will specify requirements for conflict-free supply chains in their public procurement performance clauses and further include responsible mineral extraction in their existing development cooperation with third countries.These and other measures will be essential to drive positive impact in communities in conflict areas as they could incentivize constructive engagement with these regions.How will this legislation influence positive change in the electronics industry?The new law will be important for bringing more fairness to the electronics industry. It offers an incentive for transparent sourcing and shows the world that this topic is high on the EU’s agenda.But while this EU law is a good first step, legislation is only one of the drivers for change. The industry, market and public and civil society all need to work together with the law to create sustainable impact.From an industry perspective, this legislation will increase awareness around these issues and provide positive opportunities for creating alliances and partnerships. At the same time the main requirement of the regulation is for importers to implement a due diligence process to minimise the risk of financing armed groups. To create actual change for the countries that are plagued by human rights violations related to mineral extraction, the promotion of responsible sourcing from conflict affected and high risk areas to grow the volume of legitimate trade would need to be encouraged.Creating transparent supply chains and supporting the development of local economies takes resources and investment, and will in many cases mean accepting instead of mitigating risks on the short to mid-term. Mining sites in high risk areas often provide a significant income for the surrounding communities. However it requires significant efforts, time and engagement to facilitate a long term development from high to low risk mine sites. In order to avoid that whole regions depending on mining income will be drawn further into a poverty cycle, market access and investments in local communities are crucial. Market access itself requires that systems are in place to enable the tracing of a certain material to its origin and monitor the production circumstances.Conflict-free tungsten mine site where material is being washed and ground up.In sum, all of this takes time and significant efforts. We hope that the law will encourage importers to go beyond compliance and proactively find ways to improve their supply chains, without completely turning away from specific regions. The rest of the industry such as the brands have a role to play here too, as they can incentivise and reward importers that source responsibly from conflict and high risk areas by linking their supply chain to these sources.The market also plays an important role. We strongly believe that companies will change their practices once they see the market value. As consumers like you become more aware of the issues, you can ask for increased transparency and demand and buy fairer products. Similarly, other incentives such as government procurement play a role here. In the end, companies with fair, sustainable, transparent supply chains should be rewarded with a competitive advantage.Finally, civil society, including non-profit organizations, industry watchdogs and the media need to keep making noise. They have the task of continuing to inform readers as well as draw attention and challenge the entire industry and government about issues, challenges and successes throughout the electronics industry.What does this legislation mean for Fairphone?Because the EU legislation doesn’t include any requirements for brands and manufacturers, it doesn’t impact Fairphone directly. But its goals align closely with what we’re already doing: creating transparent supply chains and tracing materials to their source. Now and in the years ahead, we will continue to focus on improving our existing conflict-free supply chains for tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. In addition, we’re creating a shortlist of new material supply chains to focus on in the near future with the help of our recently completed materials scoping study.Conflict-free tungsten is bagged and tagged as part of a traceability program.We often get asked the question whether we think the legislation is enough or whether the law should also apply to brands as well? We believe this is a good first step, and hope this legislation already provides a powerful incentive for end-users to embark on this journey and start improving their supply chains. However, if it turns out that the law has a limited effect as the end-users (so the brands like us) do not get engaged, mandatory requirements might need to be expanded to include end users.So, while the new EU legislation won’t affect our business model, we do believe that it will open up many new opportunities – especially for collaboration. As more companies realize and embrace the benefits of making supply chain improvements, it will help us to find new partners who are interested in going beyond the basic reporting requirements. We look forward to collaborating with a wider network to create lasting change.In the meantime, consumers, keep on voting with your wallets and show you care about transparent supply chains for your products. Businesses, suppliers, and stakeholders, contact us if you think Fairphone can be a platform for new, innovative initiatives."ÿÿNew EU conflict mineral legislation: another step towards industry-wide change - Fairphone

iFixit's teardowns are handy disassembly guides, and they're great for confirming just what hardware is included inside our gadgets, but most recent consumer electronics don't fare well when it comes time for the site to assign a repairability score. Today's smartphones are typically held together with proprietary screws and a lot of glue, and while there are obvious user-facing benefits to this manufacturing approach, it tends to make the gadgets harder to open, upgrade, and repair.
That's not the case for the Fairphone 2, an Android phone built by a Dutch startup that makes repairability and serviceability one of its primary features. iFixit has torn down the phone using just human hands and a Phillips-head screwdriver, and has given the phone a rare 10 out of 10 on its repairability scale because of how easy it is for users to open and fix. The battery and the screen—two components that will most need to be replaced or repaired over the lifetime of the phone—pop out without any tools at all. Removing the modules for the camera, microphone, and headphone jack isn't much more difficult.
Despite that perfect score, there is one mark against the Fairphone 2. The front glass and the LCD panel are fused together, which makes the screen look better but increases the cost of fixing it since you need to replace the glass and the LCD even if you only break one of them. This is a common iFixit bugaboo going all the way back to the days of the iPhone 5, and why it didn't knock points off the score is anybody's guess.
Update: iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens got in touch with me on Twitter and let me know that Fairphone compensated for the fused LCD and display glass by committing to provide a public repair manual for its phone. He also said that iFixit has given the fused display issue less weight over time as the practice has become more common.
The Fairphone 2 is launching primarily in Europe to start and will sell for a relatively steep €525 (about $560). It's aimed primarily at those who value repairability above all else. Its specs aren't bad—it has a 5-inch 1080p screen, a Snapdragon 801 SoC, 2GB of RAM, and Android 5.1—but it has a lot in common with flagship Android phones from early 2014. The phone is also noticeably bulkier than more mainstream phones with similar specs and screens. For reference, the OnePlus X makes you deal with OnePlus' frustrating invite system and gives up any semblance of easy repairability, but it includes similar specs for less than half the price."ÿÿiFixit gives modular Fairphone 2 a rare 10 out of 10 for repairability [Updated]

Because we want to change the way products are made, one of our principal aims is to support fair materials and incorporate them into our smartphones. However, mobile phones contain hundreds of different materials, combining more than 40 elements in fact (about one-third of the existing elements in the periodic table) and because it’s impossible to focus on so many resources all at once, we decided we needed to prioritize.To offer more clarity into the issues surrounding the various materials used in mobile phones and help us decide which to focus on in the years ahead, we worked with The Dragonfly Initiative – a consultancy that helps companies integrate sustainability into their businesses. Together we developed an approach that allowed us to get an overview of the key sustainability issues associated with the different material supply chains in order to understand and identify where our involvement can deliver the greatest impact.After conflict minerals, what comes next?Before discussing our materials scoping study, I’d like to take a quick step back. If you’ve been following our story from the beginning, you know that Fairphone started out as a campaign to draw attention to the use of conflict minerals in consumer electronics. So it was only natural that we initially focused on finding better sources of the metals known as 3TG: tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.Besides raising awareness, our key reason for focusing on these four minerals first was to support communities where we make a real difference. As a result of Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, many consumer electronics companies completely stopped sourcing minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries, taking income away from areas that were already struggling economically. We wanted to specifically engage with initiatives in these countries to encourage economic development and responsible mining practices where it was most urgently needed.As a result, over the past three years, we’ve joined existing initiatives to source conflict-free tin and tantalum from the DRC, we’ve collaborated with an Austrian smelter to re-open the tungsten trade in Rwanda and we’ve achieved the very first pilot gold supply chain including Fairtrade certified gold in the electronics industry with assistance from Fairtrade.The journey of a conflict-free mineral into the Fairphone 2.However, financing conflict is just one of the many pressing issues in the mining industry. And while conflict-free sourcing is a first step to enable economic development of mining communities it does not necessarily address wider social, environmental or human rights concerns such as dangerous working conditions and child labor. Moreover, these issues are found in many other material supply chains besides the defined conflict minerals. Therefore, to help guide our next steps in sourcing fair materials, we collaborated on this materials scoping study. The overall goal was to assess the various materials used in smartphone production and identify which supply chains we should focus on in the coming years.The first set of criteriaWe worked with The Dragonfly Initiative to develop a set of criteria that would help us prioritize which material supply chains we could engage with. Based on these criteria, they evaluated 38 different materials used in the production of smartphones. The criteria are not exhaustive and certainly don’t include all of the concerns related to the various supply chains, but it’s a starting point for identifying the most significant and persistent issues. We’ve explained some of the criteria below — the rest can be found in our indicator list.So, what did The Dragonfly Initiative evaluate? They began with a high-level investigation of each material to understand whether it made sense for us to pursue interventions. For example, we wanted to know how much of the material was used by the electronics industry as a whole as well as how much was used in our phones. We also wanted to understand if there were substitutions likely to become available that could offer a more responsible alternative.Next, we wanted greater insight into the potential for recycling. That meant looking at how quickly the material is being depleted from global reserves, as well as how much is currently being recycled. We also wanted to understand how ‘easy’ it is to extract this material from electronic waste.We then dove into human rights and environmental risks, starting with the amount of production that comes from artisanal or small-scale mining (ASM). Although much has been done over the last decade to develop responsible frameworks (like Fairtrade or Fairmined!), higher levels of ASM indicate that materials are more vulnerable to issues such as child labor, forced labor and poor working conditions. From an environmental and health perspective, we analyzed a huge range of indicators including water and soil contamination, association with airborne pollutants and toxic chemicals used during processing. If you’re curious to know more, please view the full list of criteria.Secondary criteria examines intervention opportunitySo… what does this tell us? It signifies that there is a whole web of supply chains behind the making of each phone, with each of them displaying issues we would like to change. However, in order to have impact, we need to be very selective and prioritize carefully. This is where the second level of analysis relating to intervention opportunities came in. This criteria helped to uncover where we could potentially make the greatest impact.In an upcoming post, we will take a more in-depth look at each of these materials and the countries where these materials are mined, as well as the status of the mining sector and its contribution to the country’s GDP. We will also identify possible opportunities for collaboration, for example by looking at which components and industries were using these materials.This information gives us a clearer picture of how accessible individual supply chains are, how sustainable and scalable projects might be, and the probability of Fairphone succeeding in making lasting improvements.Our shortlist of ten potential materialsThe outcome of The Dragonfly Initiative’s methodology was a shortlist of ten materials that we would like to focus on. They are: tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold, cobalt, copper, gallium, indium, nickel, and rare earth metals.Read the full accompanying guide, or download the matrix in PDF or PNG.We used the information collected by The Dragonfly Initiative to create a color-coded matrix (ranging from low to high risk) to offer an “at a glance” visual representation of the opportunities and risks across all 38 material supply chains. Look carefully and you’ll be able to identify the hot spots by concentration of color.Based on the information we currently have, these materials represent the most compelling combination of significance and risk, combined with the potential for successful interventions and wide-reaching impact. However, realistically, it is unlikely that we’ll be able to improve all of these supply chains. We will continue to consider the options and re-prioritize as different opportunities (or barriers) arise. Our aim is to leverage our small size and reputation to bring together different parties, explore what is possible and selectively focus on the best opportunities for change. This includes taking emerging awareness into account as this creates a momentum. Ideally, this will translate into setting up and/or supporting initiatives the can be scaled up by larger parties.Soon, we’ll take an in-depth look at each of these materials, where they are found in smartphones and the specific social, environmental and supply chain issues related to each one. In the meantime, we’d like to invite any businesses, NGOs or individuals who are interested in improving these specific material supply chains to get in touch with Fairphone!"ÿÿFairer materials - a list of the 10 we’re focusing on - Fairphone

Gold will never lose its allure. It’s useful, beautiful, rare, and an essential material for many different products. However, many parts of the gold sector remain tainted by environmental destruction, conflict and human rights abuses. Currently, only a limited amount of small scale gold mines can meet standards as high as Fairtrade. That’s why in 2017, Fairphone, Philips, Solidaridad, Fairtrade, UNICEF and Hivos/Stop Child Labour entered into a five-year partnership to support a more responsible approach to gold sourcing. One-and-a-half years into this partnership, we’re making progress towards our goals, while learning valuable lessons from the challenges we’re encountering.Finding the right partners on the groundGlobally, artisanal and small scale mines (ASMs) are responsible for 12% – 15% of the world’s gold supply. Their informal status leaves 1.5 million child laborers vulnerable to exploitation, collapsing mines and toxic chemicals. In Uganda in particular, 26% of children are identified as laborers, with 15,000+ estimated to be working in ASMs.At the same time, income from ASM mining is key to many livelihoods and several ASM mines have demonstrated that they can meet high-performance standards and contribute to local development.Local miners at work in an ASM near the town of Tiira.We are partnering with three carefully selected ASM associations in Busia, Uganda: Tiira Small-scale Miners’ Association, Tiira Landlord Miners’ Association, and Busia United. By helping these three associations to access investment, equipment and training, they can become a template within their wider industry. Step by step they will demonstrate that yes, you can gradually increase productivity that contributes to improved economic capacity. yes, you can improve social and environmental performance. and no, you don’t need to rely on child labor.Sharing resources to scale-up ambitionsBy pooling our expertise, our international coalition is better able to advance our goals. While Fairphone steers and aligns the different parties in the group, Royal Philips is conducting international market outreach to encourage suppliers to integrate responsibly sourced gold in their supply chains. At the same time, Solidaridad is building capacity at the mines to increase safety, efficiency and profits.An investment facility will soon start providing capital to the ASMs in the form of gold processing equipment, led by the Fairtrade Foundation. This capital provision is implemented against the commitment and efforts of the artisanal mining organizations. These gradual improvements following set social and environmental criteria, eventually, can lead to Fairtrade certification.Uniting stakeholders of our joint project during a feedback session in the office of UNICEF Uganda.In the communities surrounding our partner mines, Hivos/Stop Child Labour is implementing two Child Labour Free Zones. It is a significant outreach effort, aiming to have contact with over 700 households, positively impacting the future of over 400 children. These children will either be prevented from entering into child labor or withdrawn from work and reintroduced to school. While this work happens on the ground, UNICEF is actively lobbying Uganda’s national parties for better legislation surrounding child labor concerns.Keep the momentum goingWe’re feeling excited about what the future holds for this consortium. Just nineteen months into the project, we have established social and environmental criteria for ASMs in Uganda to work towards, increased the transparency of our supply chains, and have begun building a coalition willing to source this responsible gold. As we keep on progressing, we are confident that in close cooperation with our partners, we can develop a sustainable, traceable gold supply in Uganda.Partnering with regional government representatives, local officials and opinion leaders is essential for sustainable progress.Join usWe are looking for companies that are willing to source gold from our project or to contribute financially. Together we can extend and expand this life-changing project beyond 2019.

Responsible material sourcing has been at the heart of the Fairphone story since our early days as an awareness campaign about conflict minerals. This week, we’re pleased to share some noteworthy updates on one of our priority materials for supply chain improvements: gold.Smelters added to list of suppliersOur latest steps regarding gold clearly illustrate Fairphone’s two-pronged approach to improving supply chains. From the top down, we begin by gathering information to map all the different actors that contribute to making our phones… because as our value chain team likes to say, “you can’t change what you don’t know”.In the past, we’ve examined our gold supply chain from the perspective of individual components, such as tracing its path into our PCBs with our Chinese manufacturer. We also completed an extensive materials scoping study of 38 materials found in our phones, which helped us identify gold as one of the materials we want to keep focusing on in the years ahead – based on its importance for manufacturing phones, as well as the opportunities for improvement in the supply chain.Most recently, we’ve published a new edition of our list of suppliers. After initially uncovering information about our final assembly manufacturers, component suppliers and sub-component suppliers, we’ve now dug a couple levels deeper to include a list of smelters as well. The expanded list discloses all of the (potential) smelters that our suppliers source from, focused specifically on the four recognized conflict minerals: tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.Joint forces for more responsible goldOur top-down mapping helps inform the other half of our approach to improvement: working from the bottom up to identify or develop best practices and positive mining initiatives and connect them to our supply chain. This part of our approach is especially important: while top-down mapping helps identify high level ‘risks’, we firmly believe that our efforts need to go beyond mitigating risks. That’s why we pro-actively look for opportunities to improve and create a positive impact, which often requires close collaboration with miners, as well as investments and time.For gold, we previously completed a small but innovative project to integrate Fairtrade gold from Peru into our supply chain. While we were very proud of the results of this project, we know that the amount of gold needed to produce the Fairphone 2 is too small to create a lasting difference in the gold supply chain. That’s why we’re excited to share the details about our most ambitious step yet for sourcing more responsible gold.It all started last year, when we began contributing to the gold covenant, an initiative spearheaded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs which aims to increase the supply of responsibly sourced gold. The covenant brought together a variety of parties with an interest in the gold sector, including commercial businesses, industry boards and non-profit organizations.Mine in Busia, Uganda (February 2018).Our discussions with other covenant participants resulted in something special: a new partnership focused on practical ways to create a more responsible gold supply chain. Besides Fairphone, the initiators include Hivos/Stop Child Labour (SCL), UNICEF, Fairtrade Foundation, and Solidaridad. RVO (Netherlands Enterprise Agency) is supporting our activities as a funding partner. It’s one of the first gold-related partnerships that’s bringing together NGOs and electronics manufacturers to address both ends of the supply chain, from mining to integrating the resulting gold into our products.For the first phase of our partnership, we aim to make tangible, short-term improvements, starting with sourcing more responsible gold from Uganda. We’re currently working with artisanal and small-scale mines (ASM) in Uganda to establish a sustainable, traceable gold supply chain that creates a better future for miners and their families, and can also serve as a blueprint for other projects.Because of our commitment to influencing change in areas where it’s most needed, for us, it made sense to work in Uganda. The country has a long tradition in gold mining and a large concentration of artisanal and small-scale mines (ASM), but many of the mining activities are unregulated. Besides smuggling and environmental damage, the lack of regulation can lead to human rights abuses, including child labor. In fact, up to 30% of the workers in Uganda’s mines might be children.Women working at a mine in Busia, Uganda (February 2018). Therefore, to contribute to more responsible gold mining in Uganda, we must address a variety of interconnected factors. For example, we aim to tackle the issues at the root of the child labor – ranging from access to education to better incomes for adults. At the mines themselves, we want to increase economic prosperity with training and better mining equipment. And to ensure sustainable production and profits, we intend to provide long-term access to international markets. Throughout the course our activities, we will also evaluate and share our results to encourage other supply chains and industries to replicate our best practices and expand the overall impact.Each of the partners will play a different role in the process based on their area of expertise. Hivos/Stop Child Labour and UNICEF will focus primarily on the prevention and reduction of child labor. Fairtrade Foundation and Solidaridad will introduce improvements to increase gold miners’ incomes. Fairphone will pilot a new export model that connects the Ugandan gold directly to the electronics industry. In addition, as the key coordinator of the project, Fairphone will drive the overall program and align the different partners over the course of our collaboration.Follow our journey to source fairer goldThe activities in Uganda are well underway, and last year we completed assessments to select the mine sites, communities and local partners who will participate in this project. Laura (our head of Value Chain) and I are currently in Uganda to participate in a festive kick-off event with local and international partners, as well as local government authorities.We invite you to follow along on our journey to learn more about our supply chain and source more responsible gold. To learn more, you can download our updated list of suppliers and read about the Uganda partnership on our landing page. You can also take a look at the evaluation from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published to mark the one-year anniversary of the signing of the gold covenant.

The Dutch company's latest handset goes on pre-sale from today in Europe via the Fairphone website with a suggested retail price of €450 and will ship to buyers on September 3rd.The latest Fairphone sticks with the lessons learned from previous models: it's a modular device designed for easy repairability, with a long battery life, but this time with a slimmer, sleeker look. It comes complete with a microSD card and a removable battery and is made up of six components that are designed to be easy to remove, repair and replace. The phone even ships with a screwdriver that you can use to take your phone apart. In a competitive smartphone market where devices tend to be designed with in-built obsolescence, Fairphone is one of very few alternatives that use circular economy approaches and offer tech that's designed for repairability and longevity.In terms of materials, the new device is made with responsibly sourced and ""conflict-free"" tin and tungsten, recycled copper and plastics, along with Fairtrade gold. This is the first time Fairtrade gold has been used in the supply chain in electronics manufacturing. The FP3 is also seeking better sourcing of cobalt, a key mineral and a notoriously difficult mineral to source ethically.Fairphone 3 will also be shipped in reusable packaging, with the phone coming with its own “protective bumper” for extra protection from “everyday knocks and bumps,” according to the company. Fairphone has also collaborated with the final assembly partner Arima, in Taiwan, in innovative ways, with the company paying a bonus to workers to improve wages in the factory. Fairphone also offers a recycling program to combat e-waste, even rewarding buyers for using the program to return and trade in previous (Fair)phones (offering €20 for any phone and €40 for a Fairphone or Fairphone 2) and supports collection programs in countries like Ghana.How is the Fairphone 3 different to previous models?Some of the RESET staff bought the original Fairphone, supporting the first edition. And, there is a saying that covers a lot of consumer products, from automotive to electronics: never buy the first edition. It’s age-old wisdom - let the manufacturer work out the bugs, and buy the next model if you like it.The original Fairphone was by no means a terrible device, but it was a first edition. While at least one original Fairphone in the RESET office still lives, the original used a MediaTek processor. While MediaTek are used by many manufacturers, these tend to be short-lived low-end devices. Fairphone’s objective was to support its first phone for many years. struggles with MediaTek made it hard to release Android software updates and eventually support ended earlier than the original timeframe.The Fairphone 2 was later released with a chipset from Qualcomm, the industry leader for smartphone software-on-a-chip (SoC) packages, a more appropriate offering for Fairphone’s ongoing support objectives. As proof, the Fairphone 2 continues to be supported today.So, should you buy one? One key principle of the Fairphone brand is that: ""The most sustainable phone is the one you already own"". So while sales are obviously important to the company, you should only buy a Fairphone 3 if you truly need an upgrade and you understand that it’s more like a Jeep than a Ferrari - not a sportscar smartphone that looks good for a year before it starts to age rapidly, but a utility device that's built to last."ÿÿFairphone 3: Introducing the World's Newest Ethical (and Affordable) Smartphone | Green New Deal

What if you could buy a phone that will last five years, can be easily repaired and is made as ethically as possible? That’s the aim of the latest Fairphone 3 – and on many counts it succeeds.
Ethically creating a phone is a lot harder than it may sound, but you have to start somewhere. Amsterdam-based Fairphone turned from an awareness campaign about conflict minerals into a phone company in 2013, and aims to source as many materials as possible in both human and environmentally kind ways.
Now in its third iteration, the £420 Fairphone 3 is making progress, not only in responsible sourcing of materials, but in manufacturing and longevity, with a modular, repairable design. It even comes with its own screwdriver.

There’s no two ways about it: the Fairphone 3 has a dated design. Big chunks of body at the top and bottom of the screen are reminiscent of smartphones from five years ago. The LCD display is fairly small by today’s standards at 5.7in, but is reasonable with pretty good colours and excellent viewing angles, and is just about bright enough – most of the time you’ll see the brightness cranked up to maximum. It’s covered by Gorilla Glass 5, which isn’t the latest, but at least should make it fairly scratch-resistant.
The rest of the body is utilitarian and boxy. At almost 1cm thick, the Fairphone 3 is certainly a chunky beast. The big chin and forehead, as well as fairly thick bezels each side of the screen, make the phone a lot larger than its small screen dimensions might suggest too. It’s closer in size to a phone with a screen over 6.4in, and so requires similar hand-stretching to use it.

The translucent black plastic body feels well made and hard-wearing. Being able to see the usually hidden components through the plastic makes it all the more interesting. There’s very little flex or give anywhere on the phone, which is all the more impressive give you can take the back off and remove modules.
The volume buttons and power button are all on the left side of the phone, which took some getting used to. The speaker, too, is mounted in the left side of the phone, which means you’re more likely to block it with an errant finger.
Through the back of the phone you can see the phrase “Change is in your hands” written on the battery, which is a little bit self-congratulatory for my tastes.
A USB-C socket in the bottom handles charging, while there is a (now rare) headphone socket in the top. There’s also a fingerprint scanner on the back, which works fairly well but is a bit high up the back to be easily reachable without moving the phone down your hand a little each time you need to touch it.

  Fairphone 3 review - USB-C


The Fairphone 3 won’t win any prizes for performance. It has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 632 chip from last year, which is a lower-performance mid-range processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, plus a microSD card slot for adding more.
General performance isn’t terrible, but it certainly isn’t fast, even compared with mid-range smartphones costing less. There are elements of lag and stutter all over the system. You quickly run into slowdown when simply trying to find your way to a meeting, as launching the calendar app to find an address, then Google Maps and Citymapper to compare directions was enough to repeatedly introduce significant lag. Press a button and nothing happens long enough to make you question whether you managed to actually activate the button.
Battery life is equally middle of the road at about 26 hours between charges, meaning it lasts from 7am on day one until 9am on day two. That is while using the Fairphone 3 as my primary device with a total screen time of just over four hours, lots of email and messages, browsing in Chrome, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 40 minutes of offline Amazon Prime Video and a few photos.
The Fairphone 3 doesn’t ship with a charger or cable. It charges in about 2 hours 10 minutes using a standard 30W USB-C charger, or faster using one that supports Qualcomm’s QuickCharge 3 (€19.95 from Fairphone). But there’s also the possibility of just swapping in another charged battery, given you can remove it in less than five seconds.
Fairphone OS

The Fairphone 3 ships with its own Fairphone OS, which is a standard version of Android, free of bloat or duplicated apps and all the better for it. The only minor disappointment is that it ships on Android 9, not the new Android 10, although Fairphone aims to provide security and software updates for five years from release.
Anyone who has used Android in the last five years will be familiar with it, while switching to it from an iPhone is fairly straightforward. It’s clear that Fairphone needs to do a better job at optimising the performance of the software, however, as the issues of lag are likely to be avoidable with a bit of work.
Camera

















 


  





  The camera can produce some good shots in good lighting, but struggles in low-light, while the camera app lacks a few features. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian


The Fairphone 3 has a fairly standard 12-megapixel camera on the back, which is technically the same as that fitted to Google’s Pixel 3a, but doesn’t come anywhere close, lacking the software magic that makes Google’s camera so good.
In good lighting the Fairphone 3 shoots reasonable pictures with a solid amount of detail and colour. The same goes for selfies and portraits. Unfortunately that’s not the case in middling to low light conditions. Shots taken indoors at night with a mixture of overhead and lamp lighting produced dark, grainy and indistinct images.
Overall, the Fairphone 3’s camera performance is similar to today’s budget phones: fine on a sunny day, but poor indoors.
Repair modules

Other than efforts from the company to source materials ethically, and to pay the factory workers who put together the phone a top-up to a living wage, the most exciting thing about the Fairphone 3 is its modular nature. It’s not some Google Ara reinvention of the wheel, but rather the ability to take out and replace or repair parts when they go wrong.
Starting from the removable back and battery, the rest of the phone can be pulled apart with standard screws. Fairphone even includes the correct screwdriver in the box. If a part breaks, buy a replacement module, screw it in place and away you go. That’s the idea, anyway, and repair guide masters iFixit gave it a big thumbs up recently.
The individual parts aren’t that cheap, of course, but given you can place them yourself without breaking everything else in the process it seems like a fair trade-off. A replacement camera costs €49.95, the speaker €19.95, the bottom module with the USB-C socket in it costs €19.95 and the top module with the selfie camera, headphone socket and other bits costs €29.95. Probably more widely used parts are the screen for €89.95, the battery for €29.95 or the back cover for €24.95.
Observations

Price
The Fairphone 3 costs €450 direct, or £420 from the Phone Co-op, and is available for pre-order now delivering in mid-September. The Fairphone 3 is also available on Sky Mobile on contracts starting at £21 per month.
For comparison, Google’s Pixel 3a costs £399, the OnePlus 7 costs £499 and the Motorola Moto G7 costs £220.
Verdict
The Fairphone 3 is a device full of compromises with one massive advantage: being ethical.
The design is a bit more interesting thanks to its translucent finish, but it’s chunky and dated-looking. The 5.7in screen is pretty good, but the big chin and bezels make the phone considerably larger and harder to use than it could be. It has USB-C and a headphone socket, both of which are welcome, but the odd speaker placement makes it easy to block.
The inside is the same. The clean, bloat-free Android software is good, but it’s only Android 9 not the new Android 10, and it has performance issues. Dual-sim and microSD card support is great too, but Bluetooth performance was pretty poor.
If you were to look at the Fairphone 3 simply as a £420 smartphone, you’d say it costs about £200 too much and isn’t even a great £220 phone at that. You can buy a phone with more modern design, similar specifications, performance and software for around £220 such as the Motorola Moto G7, or phones that are infinitely better at £420.
But the Fairphone 3 isn’t just another smartphone: it’s an entirely different way of thinking about how a phone and its creation fits into the world.
You can genuinely repair this phone yourself with modular components you simply unscrew and replace. If the battery is worn out, swap it out for a new one in less than 10 seconds. The Fairphone 3 is arguably the most sustainable phone you can buy, and that’s without even looking at the firm’s efforts to source all materials and manufacture the phone in as ethical manner as possible.
But I worry that a phone that has performance issues now won’t be serviceable in five years, and so all the reparability in the world won’t make it a device people still want to use in 2024. If buyers use the Fairphone 3 for two years, then dump it for a new one, that defeats the object of the exercise.
Until now it’s not been possible to put a real price on the ethical side of a smartphone in the same way you can with a Fairtrade chocolate bar. Thanks to the Fairphone 3, we now know it’s about £200. So the question is whether people are prepared to pay £200 extra to support a worthy movement. I hope they are.

Pros: ethical manufacturing, sustainable materials, truly repairable, solidly built, dual-sim, microSD card slot, headphones socket, removable battery, bloat-free, software support for five years
Cons: only Android 9, middling performance, chunky, expensive for the specs, average camera, poor Bluetooth

				With ethical consumers increasingly concerned with the origin of their purchases, almost every industry, from fashion to food to diamonds, has been held to account over the ethics of its supply chain.
Bar a small number in the tech community, the ethical implications of the electronics industry has gone largely unnoticed by many consumers. However, the smartphone many have in their pocket may have a questionable past.
													
											
The average smartphone contains over 60 different metals, so tracking the supply chain of each component is complex. The mining and processing of many of these metals contributes to environmental damage and poor working conditions for those involved.
											
For example, cobalt, found in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, is commonly sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is frequently mined by child labourers. Last year, Bloomberg reported that factory workers making the casing for iPhones were working long hours in hazardous conditions. According to a study from 2014, 97% of the 39 electronics companies studied did not pay factory workers a living wage.
Ethical electronics
However, one company is looking to change that. Amsterdam-based startup Fairphone was startup was recently referred to by Forbes as “the most sustainable and ethical phone manufacturer on the planet”, and is tackling the often damaging impact of the smartphone industry.
The company is working towards sourcing all of its components ethically though a more transparent supply chain. Currently, Fairphone’s smartphones contain fairtrade gold, as well as conflict-free tin and tungsten. The models are made from recycled plastics and copper, with the company advocating for fair working conditions in the factories in which the phones are produced. It is working towards ensuring more of the metals within its phones are responsibly sourced by 2020.
													
											
The company is also addressing the growing problem of e-waste. The amount of e-waste produced globally could dramatically increase to 120 tonnes each year by 2050 according to a recent study by the United Nations University, and a contributor to this is the built-in obsolescence of many smartphones.
A key difference to most smartphones is that Fairphones are modular. This means that it is made up of individual components that can be replaced independently of each other, thus reducing e-waste and increasing the phone’s lifespan.
“We want to motivate the entire industry”
The company has just launched its third model, the Fairphone 3, which will be available in Europe from early September for €450. Although its specs may not be able to compete with other smartphones on the market at that price point, with Wired comparing the phone’s capabilities to the cheaper Moto G7, CEO Eva Gouwens believes that the launch of the latest model is more about encouraging the smartphone industry to consider the ethics of its manufacturing process:
“We envision an economy where consideration for people and the planet is a natural part of doing business and according to this vision, we have created scalable ways to improve our supply chain and product.
“We developed the Fairphone 3 to be a real sustainable alternative on the market, which is a big step towards lasting change. By establishing a market for ethical products, we want to motivate the entire industry to act more responsibly since we cannot achieve this change alone. “
The concept of ethical electronics is not a new one. Although a fairtrade certification does not yet exist for electronics, some people within the tech community have been aware of the ethical implications of the electronics industry for a number of years with software movement activist Richard Stallman, for example, only running Linux software on fairtrade laptops.

Scrutiny of the environmental impact of hardware has led to many companies taking action, with Google recently pledge to use recyclable materials in all of its hardware by 2022, and a demand for ethical electronics may follow a similar path in the future. However, with smartphone sales reaching $522bn in 2018 and an industry which spans the globe, holding the smartphone industry to account is no easy task.
Sky Mobile recently announced that it would be offering Fairphone 3 contracts once the phone is available, making it easier for ethically minded consumers to make the switch. However, with Fairphone selling over 100,000 devices, according to The Register, it is unlikely that the company will compete with the likes of Apple and Android any time soon, with Samsung selling 75 million smartphones every quarter.
That being said, with the slowing of smartphone sales, which declined for the first time ever in 2018, it is possible that consumers will look for other criteria when purchasing a smartphone. Coinciding with a rise in ethically and environmentally conscious consumers, this may be enough to enable companies such as Fairphone to claim a larger market share, or at least become a viable option for a growing number of smartphone owners.

				Fairphone, the Dutch social enterprise that’s on a mission to rethink the waste and exploitation that underpins the business of consumer electronics, has unboxed its third smartphone.
The handset, which is sold with the promise of longevity rather than cutting edge obsolescence, goes on pre-sale from today in Europe via Fairphone’s website with a suggested retail price of €450 (depending on local taxes and levies). It will ship to buyers on September 3.
Like its predecessor, the design is modular to allow the user to swap out damaged parts for replacement modules that Fairphone  also sells.
Out of the box the phone comes with Android 9 preloaded. A post-launch update will make it easy for buyers to wipe Google services off their slate and install the Android Open Source Project instead.
Commenting in a statement, CEO Eva Gouwens said: “We developed the Fairphone 3 to be a real sustainable alternative on the market, which is a big step towards lasting change. By establishing a market for ethical products, we want to motivate the entire industry to act more responsibly since we cannot achieve this change alone.”
“We envision an economy where consideration for people and the planet is a natural part of doing business and according to this vision, we have created scalable ways to improve our supply chain and product,” she added.

Mining an ethical niche
Since 2013, the hardware startup has focused on selling smartphones attached to a pledge of fairer working conditions for the people who assemble them, and greater transparency around the sourcing of minerals and materials needed to make them — as well as designing for longevity and repairability.
More than 80% of the volume of the Fairphone 3 is recycled, according to founder (and former CEO) Bas van Abel. He also touts its own research that suggests a Fairphone 3 owner who’s able to keep and maintain the device can save 30% of CO2 emissions or more over the product’s lifetime.
In seeking to achieve its flagship ‘fair phone’ pledge the team behind Fairphone has had to go beyond the surface hardware — and innovate on developing supply chains that can live up to an ethical agenda.
Fairphone 3’s PR flags “responsibly sourced and conflict-free tin and tungsten, recycled copper and plastics”, as well as fair trade gold which it sourced for the handset (and is working to integrate into its supply chain). It also says it’s in the process of setting up an initiative for “better sourcing of cobalt”, aka the key mineral for energy transition.

On the labor and human rights front, the Fairphone 3 is assembled by Taiwanese manufacturing partner Arima — which Fairphone says it has collaborated with to “improve employee satisfaction by improving worker representation, health and safety and by paying a bonus to workers with the aim to bridge the gap between minimum and living wages in the factory”.
In practice van Abel says this means Fairphone pays the assembly workers employed by Arima a bonus based on increased performance around its social goals. Rather than, per more usual industry practice, punishing the manufacturing partner if it fails to hit stringent delivery targets — which then encourages a punishing spiral of forced overtime that erodes workers rights and welfare.
It also has social incentives programs in three other factories that put together components for the device, such as its speakers.
Despite what are clearly laudable and lofty goals, selling fairer and more ethical smartphones remains a niche business for now, with Fairphone’s total shipments to date representing less than 0.1% of the Western European smartphone market. It is also still a European-only business. But it’s a niche that van Abel says is “growing at high speed”.
“I do believe it’s very feasible for Fairphone to [ship 200,000 smartphones per year] in the next couple of years,” he says, adding: “We can address a small part of the conscious consuming market” — pointing to Gouwens’ background at a Dutch confectionary company, Tony’s Chocolonely, which was set up in 2005 to campaign for fair trade and slave-free chocolate, and now has the biggest marketshare on chocolate in Holland.
Phones are of course far more complex to make than bars of chocolate. But in recent years a maturing smartphone market has seen a slow down in the pace of technological innovation coupled with rising commoditization that’s made differentiation a major challenge for Android OEMs especially.
So if there’s a point in time when a fair trade smartphone might stand a chance against the Samsungs, Huaweis, Xiaomis, Oppos, LGs and so on then the current moment has a fair bit to recommend it.
At the same time, concern about the environmental cost of business models that depend upon continuous resource use and generate mountains of e-waste is also growing — thanks to greater visibility and awareness of the damage caused at both ends of the pipe (including as countries like China put hard limits on the types of foreign waste they’ll accept).
“I believe that we are more and more ready for [sustainability and fair trade] in consumer electronics and I do see that the conversation in consumer electronics is definitely changing — it’s much more mature on sustainability,” says van Abel. “More and more companies are looking into it, and it’s also more demanding from the consumer perspective. You see that that’s changing as well. So it will happen. It’s just that it’s not happening fast enough.”
“We’ve been not so successful in disconnecting the [consumer electronics] business models from the use of resources yet but that is a legacy from an economic system that was set up centuries ago,” he adds. “Where growth is connected to the use of resources — and that has to do with sustainability and change and a changing mindset.”
The wider conviction, for Fairphone as a social enterprise, is to work to generate momentum that pushes the consumer electronics industry towards a circular future — where fairer conditions for workers and a reduction in waste and resource use. a focus on product longevity via repairable design and component reuse. and end of life recycling are no longer exceptional but what every player strives for.
The project is indeed a massive one. And Fairphone remains very much a work in progress — an ambitious attempt at reforming all the tarnished links in the smartphone supply chain. So yes, it’s by no means perfect.
The industry that it has to interact with still contains plenty of murky corners which a tiny company has only very limited power to sway. Even as Fairphone has punched above its weight by using campaigning roots to build consumer awareness and industry buy in that’s enabled it to enact small on-the-ground changes which have the potential to scale into something bigger.
Its investors include Bethnal Green Ventures, Pymwymic, Doen Participaties, Quadia, Dutch Good Growth Fund and ABN Amro Fund. More than $40M has gone into the business since Fairphone was founded — in seed, VC and debt financing.
“The problem with the industry is that the deeper you go into the supply chain — like the third, fourth tier — the worse it gets,” says van Abel. “So the assembly factories where you have a direct relationship are basically the ones that are doing pretty well, also because they have all these rules and things put upon them by big manufacturers. Companies are most vulnerable on the ODMs.
“So the further you go into the supply chain where they’re really making the plastics and the small metals and that kind of stuff the worse it gets. So we really want to also make sure that that is being surfaced and that we put some attention on it… Are we able to change that deep into the supply chain? It’s really difficult to get that far as a small player but we’re trying.”
“On the supply chain we’ve been going along investing into programs all along the way,” he goes on, giving the example of a child-labor free mining program it’s set up in Uganda to source fair trade gold.
“We’re working really hard with lots of partners on the ground. It’s getting off the ground now but the gold that we get from there is not connected to the supply chain of the [Fair]phone yet — so that will be an innovation that will come along the way, coming in 2020.
“What we do now is we’ve taken all the supply chains that we had for Fairphone 2 and were able to get that into Fairphone 3. So at least we have everything that we covered with Fairphone 2 but in a way that is also more scalable. Previously we had the gold through our own supply chain going into the factories. Right now we have it set up in such a way that other companies can use that same gold and the factory can scale up with that gold as well. So it’s a higher amount, it’s more scalable but we’re also setting up new initiatives.”
“Another one is cobalt which we’re investing in a lot — which is used for batteries,” he adds. “If we get that initiative up and running it’s also very interesting for the car industry to actually use that same supply chain. Because one of the things that a lot of the industry is focusing on is recycling. But we all know that there’s not enough to recycle to actually feed the supply chain with the amount of minerals we need to make our products. So we still need mining. And that’s one of the things that the industry has not been very open about.”
Virgin resources being necessary to manufacture shiny gadgets and electronics-packed machines is the industry’s dirty not-so-little secret. This means mines where minerals are dug out of the earth in order to be refined or smelted for use in the modules and components packed inside devices.
Even consumer tech giants that make claims for the labor and welfare standards of their third party assembly factory workers aren’t typically making promises that extend all the way back to the mines where the minerals essential to their devices are dug out and processed. Fairphone is at least trying to dig into the dirtiest stuff.

“We have an approach where we look at closed pipe supply chains for certain materials from the mines all the way to the component. And we look at the factories that are involved along the line per component because we can’t do all the factories — so we can at least say along that whole supply chain we’ve looked at the factories working it in,” says van Abel.
“If you look at mining there’s nothing beautiful about mining… Mining in itself is bad for the environment, there’s a lot of harsh working conditions, it’s in third world countries many of the times, so it’s not a focus area of a lot of these companies because it’s… a far away story. So many of these manufacturers and phone companies focus on recycling.
“In itself recycling is not bad it’s just that we still need all these virgin materials. Also recycling is kind of a last resort as I see it — reusing components would be a better thing. And even the best thing would be using the phone as long as possible.”
Repairable for half a decade+
Like its predecessor, the latest Fairphone’s flagship feature — aside from fairer and more ethical assembly — is that it’s designed to be repairable. A fact that’s front and center when you open the box and find a tiny screwdriver nestled alongside what otherwise looks a fairly standard (if slightly chunky) Android smartphone.

There’s no charger, USB cable or headphones in the box — intentional omissions to reduce unnecessary e-waste. The novel presence of a tiny metal and plastic screwdriver seems a fair trade for the usual accessories which Fairphone has calculated most phone buyers will already own. (If not, it can sell you a charger.)
Its big promise with this, its third generation handset, is that it will be supported for the next five to seven years.
van Abel tells TechCrunch he’s confident it can deliver on that “bold” pledge — having learnt some hard lessons over the past five+ years of pushing against ingrained industry habits baked into clockwork component upgrade cycles.
It wasn’t always like this. Some buyers of the first-gen Fairphone were disappointed and even angry when it announced it was ending support for that device in 2017 — meaning an early adopter would only have had between two and 3.5 years’ support for a smartphone that was sold as ‘repairable by design’.
The problem Fairphone found itself first crashing into, and next seeking to tackle head on, is that the consumer electronics industry as a whole is not geared up for sustainability and repairability but rather locked to regular (wasteful) upgrade cycles which in turn drive regular ~two-year component refresh cycles.
This tick-tock onward march of upgrades makes supporting older hardware a challenge. In seeking to go against the grain Fairphone has literally had to stockpile enough components to ensure it can offer years of spare part runway to support its devices.
In parallel, industry software has also needed to evolve so chipsets can be supported for longer — and van Abel says “a lot of software is actually changing. You can upgrade more and more easily to new software” — so it’s finally in a position to be confident that the latest handset can last.
“Our company has gotten much more mature,” he also says. “We are better equipped to deal with the scaling, the financial position has increased and has changed up to a point which is much more solid — so the whole support system, the ecosystem, around the phone has improved a lot.”
The Fairphone 3 is its second handset design to incorporate repairable modules that are designed to be accessible to the user. It comes in a translucent shell that also acts as a protective bumper and is stamped proudly down the side with the words “designed to open”.
Crack into it and you’ll find six modules that can be swapped out with a little bit of elbow grease and a Phillips #00 screwdriver — including the display, speaker and camera, as well as the battery (harking back to days when replaceable batteries were a smartphone norm).
Fairphone 3 — modularity refined
The aim of this type of modularity is not for customization or upgrades but for sustainability by increasing longevity by making it easy and cheaper to replace a damaged or defunct component vs junking the whole phone or having to take it to a specialist shop for expensive repair.
To be clear Fairphone is not offering upgradable hardware modules to boost phone performance over time but like for like replacements. It wants each Fairphone user to keep the same handset for longer — even if it gets dropped and the screen cracked, or used so much the battery loses its capacity to hold a charge.
“One of the biggest changes we’ve seen in the phone industry is that there’s small incremental innovation — which is in our benefit. So I think the time is right now,” says van Abel. “We are able to support phones longer. It has to do with the hardware, it also has to do with the software. The software you see that many of the software platforms… offer a better integration with the chipset. So also for future upgrades.
“You will see the software will run for longer time also on these chipsets — which basically are at a point where you will not run WhatsApp faster on a newer chipset. For some [other] stuff, especially on 3D gaming and the really high end computing stuff, it makes sense to go to the new processors but most of the stuff you will be able to do on the average processor on the phone. So it paves the way to keep phones in the hands of the consumers for a longer time, which makes sense. Because it’s cheaper for consumers… and it also is more sustainable.”
With the Fairphone 3 he says the company sought to dial down the “radical” modularity of its earlier crack at the concept — so the result is less of a ‘party trick’ smartphone design, as the Fairphone 2 was (he dubs it a “show off” phone) — and more, well, dull but worthy. modularity as a utility that’s there to enable (occasional) repairs.
“You don’t need the phone to be so super smooth in taking apart to be able to repair it,” he says. “Fairphone 2 goes beyond the idea of repairability. It’s more a show off phone in that sense. And that also comes with risks.”
Fairphone 2 — its earlier, flashier crack at modularity
Refining its approach to modularity also means Fairphone has been able to reduce the cost of the handset. Consumers will see that in a cheaper price-tag (€75 less than the prior model) — which puts it in reach of a bigger group of potential buyers.
The design is a cost (and risk) saver for Fairphone too in that it’s easier to manufacturer.  And cost and sales volume are important when you’re trying to demonstrate that making sustainable hardware can still turn a profile. (Not that Fairphone is there yet — but finding a path to profitability is a core part of the mission.)
For users the only slight downsize of the reconfigured modular design — which has a full 13 screws just holding the display module in place — is that getting to the guts involves more fiddling than it used to. Which again seems a fair trade given how rarely you should need to get into it.
“Fairphone 3 there’s less risk involved in manufacturing, the design is more sturdy so in that sense it’s also a phone we can scale with as a company — so the whole ecosystem around it. the quality control,” says van Abel. “We have a big team now in China which we didn’t have with Fairphone 2. So we are much more confident with this phone we can offer a very high qualitative product.”
If the aim of your social enterprise is to reduce e-waste and overall environmental impact by selling phones that are designed to last longer than rival devices there is something of a natural tension about releasing any new handset model at all.
When I put this to van Abel he agrees but points to the push and pull around the product, given the unavoidable need for Fairphone “to stay relevant” by appealing to smartphone buyers, and given the industry “not working int he way that we would like it to work”, as he puts it — i.e not being geared for longevity.
Fairphone definitely needs to be able to sell phones if it’s to make a positive dent in consumer electronics practices and processes. Which means enticing buyers is important.
And on that front its last model wasn’t an amazing success — saddled with uninspiring hardware at a fair trade premium price. (A pretty biting 2016 review by Wired called it “ethical but ugly”, complaining also that it had a slow camera and dated hardware.) Closing that ‘compromise gap’ is thus a key aim with Fairphone 3.
van Abel enthusiastically talks up the performance specs, noting particularly that they’ve put a lot of work into improving battery performance (the removable cell is 3000mAh, and includes fast charging) and on software engineering to integrate the camera — which he claims, as far as performance and photo quality goes, is “on par” with high end smartphones “that cost twice as much”.
At a glance the 5.7 inch full-HD screen also looks clear and crisp. Plus there’s a fingerprint reader on board, as well as NFC and 4G. Inside is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 engine, 4GB of RAM and a generous 64GB of storage (further expandable via an SD card slot). Dual SIM slots are another welcome touch.
The handset comes preloaded with a vanilla implementation of Android 9 (Pie). But as noted above buyers will be able to switch for a non-Google alternative — via an updater that will let them wipe and install the Android Open Source Project flavor of the OS. (The updater will come post-launch, according to van Abel, who notes that around 5% of Fairphone users opt to go full open source.)
Ethics aside, one straight up hardware boast the Fairphone 3’s got going for it is that it has a 3.5mm headphone jack. Which is something you won’t find on Apple’s latest iPhones. Nor on Samsung’s newest flagship. The march of tech progress has erased the accessory-friendly hole from premium devices.
So it’s a nice additional perk for Fairphone 3 buyers who’ve invested in wired headphones — meaning they can keep using other kit for longer too.
From fair trade chocolate to smartphones as a service
The smartphone industry has marched at a pretty steady clip since Fairphone 2 was released at the back end of 2015, with rivals updating their own much more expansive product portfolios at least annually. So an upgrade more than three years after the last Fairphone doesn’t seem overly wasteful or indulgent.
And while Fairphone has never pretended it’s going to be able to compete, like for like, with top tier smartphones on pure hardware specs and features it does need to be able to offer a phone that’s compelling enough to convince buyers to switch.
Good enough smartphone hardware with a guarantee of repairability and which is combined what it calls “fair specs” — i.e. a minimum wage for a workers in its supply chain plus a bonus that aims to close the gap with that and a living wage — is its sales pitch for Fairphone 3.
Who Fairphone buyers are is also expanding, according to van Abel. So while, two years ago, he talked of the typical user being a ‘Gen X German with a master’s degree’, now the target is any conscientious consumer.
Selling at least 100,000 handsets per year is the goal. To date it’s only sold ~175,000 Fairphones in total — through pre-sales and organic growth — but it reckons the new device will enable it to scale beyond that core fan-base to address a wider community of ethical consumers.
It’s being helped to that end by expanded carrier partnerships — such as one with Orange in France which will see the mobile operator range the handset in 600 stores.
Scaling sales is another necessary part of the social mission, says van Abel — as Fairphone needs to show its social impact investors that it’s growing demand and building a market for ethical alternatives.

When — or even whether — there will be a Fairphone 4 is a question he isn’t keen to engage with. Clearly the hope is Fairphone 3 packs enough smartphone punch to go the distance. Though he hints it might look to offer additional smartphones in order to enter the US, a major market it’s so far not addressed at all.
While Fairphone has had a singular device focus to date, van Abel says it’s thinking about applying its hard won learnings around electronics supply chains to other types of consumer devices — suggesting ‘Fair’ could end up as a brand prefix atop an assortment of consumer gadgets.
“I think Fairphone has developed itself — even though it’s called Fairphone — into a brand that I’m pretty sure can go into a full blown, sustainable, consumer electronics brand. Because there are none,” he tells TechCrunch. “There are not so many brands in the industry that can differentiate on what they stand for. Apple does pretty well on design. But for the rest I don’t know a lot of premium brands that can differentiate on something that they’re really good at. And we’re good at creating social innovation and sustainability. And a lot of the supply chains that we’re using already can be used for other products as well.”
More broadly, the business is evolving to sell sustainably-minded process change back to the electronics industry itself — which of course needs to reform wholesale in order to enact the kind of root and branch change needed to support a fully circular economy.
In practice this means the ethical supply chains it establishes are intended to be open for others in the industry to use too. So Fairphone’s business of making ‘fairer’ handsets also functions as a showcase and case study to encourage wider industry reform — including via some direct partnerships that allow its own tiny orders for key minerals to be fulfilled by it piggybacking and scaling the order with the help of larger buyers.
Of course everything in electronics is connected. So real change isn’t going to happen overnight. Which makes being committed to stick at it and drive consumer awareness essential. It’s a long game. Even ethical chocolate took its sweet time to take over the market.
“With Fairphone 1 we had our own supply chains, with Fairphone 2 we were more and more exploring incorporating into scalable solutions for other parties as well, and with Fairphone 3 we already have consortia — for example the cobalt we’re doing together with Royal Philips and Signify… and some other big brands I can’t mention,” van Abel tells us. “Systemic change only happens when the whole system changes — so we can’t do that as a small company ourselves.”
He says the key shift the consumer electronics industry must make to pull off transformative reform to a circular economy that’s better for humans and better for the environment is to change its business model — a centuries old model that’s still obsessed with pushing “as much as possible into the hands of consumers at the fastest rate possible”.
On this front he believes services business models offer exciting potential to retune incentives for consumers and businesses to flip the conventional model on its head.
Fairphone is currently experimenting with a service based smartphone offering — working with a local insurance company on a trial to offer Fairphone as a service, where the phone is leased not owned.
“If you sell a phone every three to five years to a person you can also survive as a company. It’s not that you can’t survive. But — having said that — one of the things we are experimenting with is Fairphone as a service… And the beautiful aspect around running a product as a service is on the profit and loss of the company. When I sell you a phone you become a cost center right away as a customer, because all the after sales, everything around it basically is cost,” he says.
“If I sell you a service and a hardware product comes with it for you to be able to use… then I’m intrinsically motivated to have you use that phone as long as possible because every time I need to make a new phone it’s cost. Whereas every month I get my money from you as a customer and I can actually keep developing my service up to a point that it is more tailor made.”
While leasing has been very common in the smartphone industry on the mobile operator side, Fairphone is approaching it from a phone maker perspective — which van Abel reckons offers potential for disconnecting “as much as possible” the use of resources from the business model attached to smartphones.
‘Fairphone as a service’ is just a pilot for now, and he concedes the model would require a lot of money to be put on the table up front to cover the cost of use of the device for several years (further lengthening already lengthy repairable-oriented device cash cycles) — but recurring subscription payments at least sound like a model that could unlock the necessary up-front capital.
(van Abel also points to changes going on in the funding space — saying impact investing is now “hot”, and adding: “We’ve been pretty successful at finding the right impact investors to support our growth.”)
“I’m pretty hopeful because [humans have] been pretty successful at selling people stuff they don’t need so I’m pretty sure that we can also reverse that into marketing stories around products that last longer and people wanting products to last longer,” he says. “There’s a whole playground [with services]. Can you imagine that you start rewarding people if they actually keep their phone longer, if they have less parts broken… Now you reward a loyal customer with a new phone — what if you reward a customer that has their phone for a very long time with a lower subscription rate, for example. So there’s so much stuff to play with in that area. Not only by phone companies but also operators and everyone that is in connection with customers.”

“My vision is really the disconnect from the use of resources and the business models. That is really the key problem that we’re still dealing with — if you look at sustainability,” he adds. “From a human rights perspective we’re dealing with multiple complex situations where politics, countries, wars, all these things are attached to these supply chains — which have nothing to do with consumer electronics specifically, it has to do with the human condition. So that’s even a bigger challenge — in terms of how do we create world peace basically?”
While no one would pretend there’s an easy answer for that, changing anything for the better means being willing to start somewhere."ÿÿCan Fairphone 3 scale ethical consumer electronics? – TechCrunch

Infantino was elected president of football's world governing body in February, replacing the disgraced Sepp Blatter
Fifa president Gianni Infantino is to be interviewed by ethics investigators following allegations he breached the governing body's code of ethics.
BBC Sport has learned Infantino will meet Robert Torres, a member of the investigatory chamber of the Fifa ethics committee.
The interview in Zurich - possibly as early as Friday - is part of a preliminary probe.
If there is sufficient evidence then a full investigation could be opened.
Under such circumstances Infantino could be suspended from his role for up to 90 days.
The allegations relate to a possible conflict of interest when using private jets laid on by a World Cup-bidding country. that he filled senior posts without checking people's eligibility for the role. and billing Fifa for mattresses, flowers, an exercise machine and personal laundry.
A Fifa spokesperson told BBC Sport: ""The Fifa president has stated publicly he fully respects the independence and work of the ethics committee and that he would provide, if required, whatever information necessary to facilitate any potential review by the committee.
""The president has made clear that he has acted appropriately and in accordance with Fifa's code of ethics.""
Infantino is said to be ""very confident"" that no further action will be taken with sources close to the former Uefa secretary general describing the allegations as ""absurd"" and ""baseless"".
External legal counsel is said to have been hired by Fifa to provide an independent assessment of the claims against Infantino. It is believed to have concluded he has no case to answer.
The same sources have described the allegations as part of a ""vendetta"" against Infantino by unnamed people who have recently left Fifa. Documents, it is claimed, have been deliberately leaked in order to destabilise the man elected to the top job in world football in February.

Fifa president Infantino ready to implement reforms
Fifa has been hit by a spate of high profile departures in recent months.
Domenico Scala resigned as Fifa's head audit and compliance in May while the governing body's one time finance director and acting secretary general, Markus Kattner, was sacked that same month amid allegations of financial impropriety.
Kattner was fired after the discovery of a secret bonus scheme which paid him millions of dollars over a period of years.
A number of other employees have left, or are expected to leave, following a major restructuring within Fifa's Zurich headquarters.
A further 18 potential witnesses are understood to have been questioned as part of the preliminary probe into Infantino.
Torres is said to be leading the investigation given that the chairman of the ethics investigatory chamber, Cornel Borbely, and Infantino are both Swiss nationals.
The interview by investigators follows the leaking, to German media, of an internal Fifa memo.
Domenico Scala was Fifa's head of audit until he resigned in May amid Fifa's corruption crisis
Infantino was alleged by an unnamed Fifa insider to have used private jets during a trip to visit the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosts Russia and Qatar, raising questions of a potential conflict of interest.
Fifa organised the flight to Moscow but an airline transfer to Doha was not available following a late change in the schedule by his Russian hosts.
Infantino and his staff then travelled by private jet, arranged by the Russians. The Gulf state in turn organised the return trip to Switzerland.
There have also been reports in Swiss and German media that Infantino, after attending the Champions League Final in Milan in May, flew on to Rome for an audience with the Pope. He then returned to Geneva.
Gianni Infantino: &quot.We will restore the image of Fifa&quot.
But sources say that flight will be argued not to be a breach of Fifa's code of ethics given it was a private arrangement with a family friend who is unconnected to football.
The leaked internal document also alleges that Infantino demanded Fifa hire an external driver, who then billed the governing body for driving Infantino's family and advisors around while he was abroad.
It also details costs authorised by Infantino of:
•£8,795 for mattresses at his home
•£6,829 on a stepper exercise machine
•£1,086 for a tuxedo
•£677 on flowers
•£132 on personal laundry
It also makes reference to how many of the candidates chosen by Infantino to fill senior posts had not passed the relevant eligibility checks, including the new Fifa secretary general, Fatma Samoura.
But Infantino believes the case will be dismissed given the relevant facts.
For example, it's understood Infantino wanted a bed removed from an office space previously occupied by Sepp Blatter. The former Fifa president is understood to have been partial to an afternoon nap on occasion.
In its place Infantino asked for a step machine, with an expectation one would be brought in from Fifa's on-site gymnasium.
Instead, officials purchased a new one with the resultant invoice being used by Infantino's enemies, according to sources, to damage him.
The Swiss-Italian is also under pressure for failing to sign an employment contract, with reports of a dispute between him and Scala, who helped set pay levels, over his salary.
A spokesman for Fifa's investigatory chamber declined to comment ""on possible preliminary investigations.""

This afternoon I was asked by someone why I am involved in CSR and sustainability.� It is a question that I seem to asked frequently, but one that I am not sure I ever answer with any measure of clarity as I have worked in a very wide range of issues related to these big topics, and my interests for each issue hit me in different spots.
But, if there is one common thread that I feel binds each of the issues I work on (see a recent list of 35 projects I am managing through my class at CEIBS), it is that of responsibility... or the lack there of.
That, regardless of the issue under the microscope, at any one time there are up to 5 different groups that share a role and responsibility, and that should one of those groups fail to assume their responsibility, or should one of those groups act in a deliberate manner to upset the balance, then they are by their very nature irresponsible and are taking on a measure of risk to their person or organization.
If this sounds a bit alien, then think back to Nike circa 1996-1997 when the entire world was given a glimpse into the realities of Indonesian labor standard.� It was a classic case of a model that was unsustainable. Nike outsourced all their manufacturing to largely Asian owned/ operated contract manufacturers (still does today), but with little oversight or belief that they had any responsibility of the conditions on the ground.� It was a denial of responsibility that lead to a huge PR disaster for them, and they took win huge losses as consumers walked away from them in what I would call an act of consumeristic responsibility.
Fast forward to 2006 when the international press got wind of an issue related to the dormitory conditions of the Suzhou factory that manufactured Apple’s famed iPod.� It was a story that immediately became controversial as Apple and Foxconn tried to skirt the stories and admit no wrong, but ultimately Apple did send over a team of investigators to Suzhou who:
In response to the allegations, we immediately dispatched an audit team comprised of members from our human resources, legal and operations groups to carry out a thorough investigation of the conditions at the manufacturing site. The audit covered the areas of labor standards, working and living environment, compensation, overtime and worker treatment. The team interviewed over 100 randomly selected employees representing a cross-section of line workers (83%), supervisors (9%), executives (5%), and other support personnel (3%) including security guards and custodians. They visited and inspected factory floors, dormitories, dining halls, and recreation areas. The team also reviewed thousands of documents including personnel files, payroll data, time cards, and security logs. In total, the audit spanned over 1200 person-hours and covered over one million square feet of facilities.
.. and what they found was:
Our audit of on-site dormitories found no violations of our Code of Conduct. We were not satisfied, however, with the living conditions of three of the off-site leased dorms that we visited. These buildings were converted by the supplier during a period of rapid growth and have served as interim housing. Two of the dormitories, originally built as factories, now contain a large number of beds and lockers in an open space, and from our perspective, felt too impersonal. The third contained triple-bunks, which in our opinion didn�t provide reasonable personal space.
To address this interim housing situation, the supplier acquired additional land and is currently building new dormitories. These plans were in place prior to our audit, and will increase the total living space by 46% during the next four months.
It was a report, a process, and reaction that while initially grabbed some press, was� in the end chalked up to� just another problem that overseas brands faced when outsourcing.� As the Wired article Judging Apple’s Sweatshop Charge seemed to conclude in their assessment:
The situation is too murky for a rush to judgment on Apple’s ethics here, and it may well meet minimum global standards. But for a company that has staked its image on progressive politics, Apple has set itself up as a potential lightning rod on global labor standards. Sweatshops came back to bite Nike after its customers rose up in arms. and Apple can expect a similar grilling from its upscale Volvo-driving fans in the months ahead.At this point,
It is at this point that Apple appears to have been genuinely woken up, or at least rattled, because 18 months later Apple released its first supplier Responsibility report (download here) where the findings of a complete review were released.� It was a report that was opened with the passage below:
Apple is committed to ensuring the highest standards of social responsibility throughout our supply chain. The companies we do business with must provide safe working conditions, treat employees with dignity and respect, and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever Apple products are made.
For the past several years, Apple has required suppliers to commit to a comprehensive Supplier Code of Conduct as a condition of their contracts with us. We drive� compliance to the Code through an aggressive monitoring program, including factory audits, corrective action plans, and verification measures.
Apple�s approach to supplier responsibility extends beyond compliance monitoring. We also provide detailed standards and ongoing training support to help suppliers continue to meet our expectations. And by making social responsibility part of the way we do business, we ensure that suppliers take our standards as seriously as we do.
.. but, it was a report whose contents were shocking as more than half of their suppliers were not in compliance.� There were material issues that were across the board (as the graphic below shows) with overtime, wages deductions, age limits, and so on, and regardless of whether or not these could be explained away or were “problems of the past”, the fact is that Apple should have at this very moment stopped dead in their tracks, realized that they were sitting on a problem, and made changes.� Changes in their partner relationships, changes in the way they monitor and measure relationships, and changes in their attitude about who is ultimately responsible for labor abuse (and other issues of corporate responsibility) within one’s supply chain.� Outsourced or not.
Sadly though, their own internal document did not provide the “come to Jesus” that it should have and last summer, again at a Foxconn site, a 25 year old employee committed suicide after he was interrogated by Foxconn employees over the theft of a prototype iPhone.� an event that I covered in my article Apple�s China Supply Chain Issues Require IMMEDIATE Attention and Action, and believe to this day that Apple should have taken the following actions:
* Contact Nike to learn lessons of how to develop an IN-HOUSE program that manages and monitors the factory conditions, * Get boots on the ground.� Pay the money for a team of people who will make inspections and be given the power to make corrections, * Invite in third parties to not only verify what Apple has found and done, but to give public credibility to the process in place, * Do the right thing and begin making better decisions about who their suppliers are, and what is expected.� If the profit from an iPhone is 50USD, spend the extra buck now to do the right thing.� It is not an expense, it is an investment, * Make materials improvements, or make materials adjustments.� Give suppliers a chance to change, but do not wait long.� Begin developing parallel supply lines and force suppliers to comply through the threat of lost business (partial or whole)., * Open Up,
Once again, this event would not serve as a learning lesson for Apple either (they largely skirted their responsibility of this once again), and 7000 employees of another Suzhou based supplier Wintek went on strike in May of 2009 over poor working conditions, and another 2000 employees again went on strike this week over working conditions and pay.�� As the China Daily article Workers protest over pay, toxic chemicals highlights:
He said at least four workers had died from overexposure to hexane, a toxic chemical workers had been asked to use for cleaning touch panels manufactured at United Win (China) Technology Ltd Co. The company is a subsidiary of Taiwan-based Wintek Corporation, one of the world’s leading producers of small mobile phone panels and touch panels. [...] Media previously cited local authorities as saying workers had been provoked by rumors that the company planned to cancel a year-end bonus, which company executives later dismissed and promised to distribute before the Chinese Spring Festival that is less than a month away.
But Zhu said it was not just about the money. “What we feel angry about is the company authorities’ apathy to our workers’ health,” he said.
Unconfirmed deaths aside, the fact that employees are being exposed to these chemicals at all should have been something that Apple’s inspectors should have picked up on.� Unless of course the team of inspectors were outside to Apple’s process, and really had no idea what they should have been looking for.� Plausible?� But, if it was Apple’s team, then they should have been looking for this type of issue, and had they found a chemical exposure issue, they should have taken action right away to make sure that employees had the equipment (suits, ventilation, etc) to protect themselves from exposure.
It just begs the question.� Does Apple feel any real sense of responsibility for the conditions of their supply chain, and why is it that a firm that is trying to crack the China market so willing to risk so much?
Is it that Apple is ignorant of the fact that these problems exist? Is it that they believe the brand is impermeable?� Or are they just scared of standing up their suppliers?
It is a horrible miscalculation in my opinion, and when speaking to a friend this evening who is in the audit business about the situation we were stuck on why a company with Apple’s size and cash position wouldn’t spend the 2-3 million USD it would take to fix this problem.
For me,it is a sign that Apple’s model is broken.� That regardless of how well they are selling now, or what the next gadget will be, that they will at some point experience the loss that Nike did in the late 90s, or larger.� That while there seems to be little recognition of Apple’s supply chain issues in the U.S, and no sustained pushback in China, Apple is playing with fire.
It has clearly set up a supply chain that allows suppliers to structure their operations in a manner that exploits the living conditions of employees.
A structure that, getting back to my first point, will become an issue of economic sustainability for Apple."ÿÿApple's Recent Strike in Suzhou is Sign of Continued Bad Labor and CSR Practices in China

Paul Mozur/The Wall Street Journal
A woman walks east from Hon Hai's Longhua facility in Shenzhen.
In recent months Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., or Foxconn as it is better known, has done an about-face with its public relations policy, opening its doors to several different Western media companies, including The Wall Street Journal. In the past, the secretive assembler of electronics for global brands like Apple and Nintendo has only infrequently allowed foreign media inside its city-sized factory campuses.
The new media blitz is the second act in Hon Hai’s public makeover, following the publication in March of findings from an audit carried out by the Fair Labor Association and an ensuing pledge by the company to improve overtime, health and safety violations found by the investigation. Two years ago an outbreak of more than a dozen suicides first brought major media attention to Hon Hai’s China factories – which employ about 1.5 million people – and since then an unfortunate mélange of plant explosions, worker riots and child labor violations has meant the spotlight has never strayed too far from the Taiwanese company.
The Wall Street Journal visited Hon Hai’s “campus” in Shenzhen – home to more than 200,000 workers – in early December. On the day we visited, Hon Hai said they were conducting an audit, which meant we weren’t able to visit the main production facilities. We were, however, able to see the kitchen, a dormitory, the employee care center, and a cafeteria among other locations on campus – places that provided interesting insights into the everyday lives of the workers who churn out some of the world’s most popular electronics products.
A consultation room inside the employee care center at Hon Hai's Shenzhen facility. Although not clear in this photo, suicide nets are visible through the barred window in back.
The company has worked to improve the lives of workers in recent years, though its efforts haven’t all been as successful as some might have hoped.
This was evident in the Shenzhen facility’s new employee care center, which gets an average of 1,200 calls and 10 in-person visits per day, according to staff. Consultations are free and the volume of interaction suggests many workers are getting help they likely otherwise would have gone without. On the other hand, staff indicated that few of the calls or visits are kept anonymous. If an employee is deemed to have a problem and a risk assessment is carried out, for example, the worker’s manager is informed and brought in to explain what issues the worker has had – hardly the sort of system that encourages frank discussion.
A view inside one of the facility's female dorms. Each room typically has eight beds.
The worker dorms have been recently outsourced to a management company that allows friends to live together. Despite the change, many workers we talked to said they preferred to live off campus to escape strict oversight by guards, who perform spot-checks on dorm rooms and enforce other rules in an occasionally harsh manner – though others defended the guards, saying worker behavior on campus was occasionally out of line.
Hon Hai has also seen mixed results with the campus learning center, which now offers expanded educational opportunities, including an array of training courses and degree programs from junior college to doctorates. Hon Hai says that around 22,000 employees had enrolled in programs at the center, which represents roughly 10% of the work force. Some workers we talked to said they preferred to study on their own or take classes off campus where hours were more flexible. One worker said that, with his long working hours, he’d likely only have time for maybe three classes a month at Hon Hai’s center and predicted he wouldn’t learn anything.

Still, Hon Hai is trying, and according to labor groups and workers, many aspects of life at the company’s Shenzhen facility are better than at other electronics factories in the area where management can be cruel, facilities lacking, overtime extreme and pay docked (or even eliminated) for trivial violations of strict factory rules.
The biggest change for Hon Hai employees will come next summer, when legal overtime restrictions of 9 hours per week are officially put into place. To keep workers around after overtime drops, the company has said it will have to raise wages. Workers interviewed separate from the tour were for the most part aware of the looming restrictions on overtime, but far less certain about whether wages would rise to make up for the cut back in hours. One worker interviewed said there were rumors that base wages could rise 50%, matching a projection by Sanford Bernstein about what Hon Hai would have to do to keep workers after cutting overtime. But the worker was quick to add, “I really don’t believe that number.”
Workers eat at one of more than a dozen cafeterias spread through the campus.
How Hon Hai will do under the new policies depends in part on the company’s credibility of workers who are suspicious that the changes will result in less pay for them. It also depends on how much of the costs Hon Hai is able to pass on to end-brands like Apple, who make a premium on the cheap production.
It’s important to remember that, despite Hon Hai’s massive scale and deep experience, there are other manufacturers out there who could seize the opportunity to grab a bit of Hon Hai’s business. One example is Pegatron, the listed manufacturing spinoff of popular Taiwanese computer company Asustek Computer, which often vies with Hon Hai for Apple contracts. Still mostly unheard of globally, the company could come in and undercut Hon Hai for some orders. Nonetheless companies like Pegatron are probably hoping to use any raises in Hon Hai’s fees to accomplish the same feat themselves and get more from the branded companies that enjoy better margins.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Another worker has committed suicide at the south China manufacturing complex of iPhone maker Foxconn International Holdings Ltd, state media reported on Friday, the latest in a string of employees who have leapt to their deaths this year.
The employee “fell to death” early on Friday at one of Foxconn’s manufacturing facilities in the southern Chinese manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, Xinhua News Agency reported.
“The death was confirmed by the municipal government. No further information was immediately available,” Xinhua said.
A Foxconn spokesman was not available for comment when contacted by Reuters.
Neither Shenzhen’s municipal government nor local police had any immediate comment or further details.
Labour rights groups say there have been at least 13 suicides at Foxconn factories across China this year, not including Friday’s fatality.
The incident comes months after several Foxconn workers, mostly in Shenzhen, died after jumping from buildings in the company’s plants earlier this year.
Many of those were young migrant workers, among the millions who leave the poor hinterlands of China for the booming factory towns of coastal areas in search of work and higher wages.
The deaths threw an awkward spotlight on the labor practices of Foxconn, a unit of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, whose clients include Apple Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and Sony Ericsson.
Since then, the company has pledged to improve work conditions, increase pay, reduce overtime hours and build a string of giant new manufacturing complexes in inland provinces such as Henan to allow workers to live closer to home, and tap cheaper labor costs.

A woman walks east from Hon Hai's Longhua facility in Shenzhen.
In recent months Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., or Foxconn as it is better known, has done an about-face with its public relations policy, opening its doors to several different Western media companies, including The Wall Street Journal. In the past, the secretive assembler of electronics for global brands like Apple and Nintendo has only infrequently allowed foreign media inside its city-sized factory campuses.
The new media blitz is the second act in Hon Hai’s public makeover, following the publication in March of findings from an audit carried out by the Fair Labor Association and an ensuing pledge by the company to improve overtime, health and safety violations found by the investigation. Two years ago an outbreak of more than a dozen suicides first brought major media attention to Hon Hai’s China factories – which employ about 1.5 million people – and since then an unfortunate mélange of plant explosions, worker riots and child labor violations has meant the spotlight has never strayed too far from the Taiwanese company.
The Wall Street Journal visited Hon Hai’s “campus” in Shenzhen – home to more than 200,000 workers – in early December. On the day we visited, Hon Hai said they were conducting an audit, which meant we weren’t able to visit the main production facilities. We were, however, able to see the kitchen, a dormitory, the employee care center, and a cafeteria among other locations on campus – places that provided interesting insights into the everyday lives of the workers who churn out some of the world’s most popular electronics products.

The company has worked to improve the lives of workers in recent years, though its efforts haven’t all been as successful as some might have hoped.
This was evident in the Shenzhen facility’s new employee care center, which gets an average of 1,200 calls and 10 in-person visits per day, according to staff. Consultations are free and the volume of interaction suggests many workers are getting help they likely otherwise would have gone without. On the other hand, staff indicated that few of the calls or visits are kept anonymous. If an employee is deemed to have a problem and a risk assessment is carried out, for example, the worker’s manager is informed and brought in to explain what issues the worker has had – hardly the sort of system that encourages frank discussion.

The worker dorms have been recently outsourced to a management company that allows friends to live together. Despite the change, many workers we talked to said they preferred to live off campus to escape strict oversight by guards, who perform spot-checks on dorm rooms and enforce other rules in an occasionally harsh manner – though others defended the guards, saying worker behavior on campus was occasionally out of line.
Hon Hai has also seen mixed results with the campus learning center, which now offers expanded educational opportunities, including an array of training courses and degree programs from junior college to doctorates. Hon Hai says that around 22,000 employees had enrolled in programs at the center, which represents roughly 10% of the work force. Some workers we talked to said they preferred to study on their own or take classes off campus where hours were more flexible. One worker said that, with his long working hours, he’d likely only have time for maybe three classes a month at Hon Hai’s center and predicted he wouldn’t learn anything.

Four workers at Apple-supplier Foxconn's Longhua plant have tried to kill themselves in the past month.
These events follow another suicide last summer and the roughing-up of a Reuters reporter that tried to investigate the factory.
Given the popularity of iPhones, iPads, and other gadgets, the world needs to have a better understanding of the conditions under which they are produced. With this in mind, here's a refresher.
Last summer, we reported on the story of Sun Danyong, the Chinese factory worker who threw himself off a 12-story building after misplacing an iPhone prototype.
We also published an account of what it's like to work at Foxconn, Sun Danyong's former employer.
Foxconn makes gadgets for companies like HP, Apple, and Nintendo.
That account, originally published by China Labor Watch, makes Foxconn factories seem less like a nightmare from Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and more like an extremely strict bording school or perhaps a white collar prison like the place they sent Bernie Madoff.

Inside China's Gadget Factories
Foxconn assembles products for vast electronics giants like Apple, HP, and Nintendo.
Foxconn employees get one hour break each day, during which they eat lunch. Employees are fined if they don't finish their rice.
China Labor Watch says Foxconn workers ""Lack of rest days as required by law. regular workers have one day off every two weeks.""
Says a Foxconn factory worker: ""The training begins immediately on the second day upon our arrival. At first I thought we would be informed of some professional operative skills and knowledge, but instead, we were taught the factory's regulations, culture, and acknowledgment of Foxconn's business concept. By now, I think it is safe to say that the training is a part of Foxconn's brain washing process. A supervisor told us that working at Foxconn requires total obedience. you do not need to be intelligent or highly skilled. After a week of training, we concluded that at Foxconn, we shouldn't treat ourselves as human beings, we are just machines. During the week, we also had a health examination, a very simple blood test, a blood pressure test and a vision test. We did not receive any results afterwards.""
One Foxconn employee gained a small amount of international fame when she mugged it up for an iPhone before it shipped. She's smiling, so wonders how terrible life could be at the factories.
Says one Foxconn employee: ""Just the second day living in the dorm, I found my safe box open, and my walkman gone. There was nothing I could do but to try to tell myself that I was lucky because it was not that expensive.""
China Labor Watch says employees complain that Foxconn dorms smell like garbage.
Foxconn employees recreate outside a factory.
Despite conditions many Americans wouldn't suffer, Foxconn is considered a desirable place to work.
Says one employee: ""I consider myself lucky because one week after the on-site training I was selected by a CCPBG recruiter, which means I am officially a regular worker. When the selection takes place, it seems like a slave market where slave owners get to pick suitable slaves. There were about a couple hundred of us going through on-site training, and when the recruiters from other companies on Foxconn campus come, all of us have to stand straight in lines, putting our hands behind our backs, and wait for these recruiters to pick. After the selection ends, those who did not get picked go back to their work post. They cannot become regular workers until being picked so I was very lucky to be selected the first week. Many of my classmates are still doing on-site training waiting to be picked.""
An entry-level employee working 12-hour days earns about $220 per month at Foxconn. That's about $.85 per hour.
Foxconn factory workers aren't allowed to talk during work.
China Labor Watch says Foxconn doesn't pay enough overtime. ""Workers are asked to work thirty minutes prior to the scheduled time with no overtime premium. Moreover, failure to reach production quota will result in extended work hours without overtime premium.""

Four employees at Apple supplier Foxconn's factory in China have tried to killed themselves in the last month.
The owner of the factory, Foxconn, which assembles products for Apple, refuses to let reporters in to tour the place.
Malcolm Moore has the latest in the Telegraph:
Even as the iPad breaks all sales records, something deeply disturbing is happening at Foxconn, the China-based company that manufactures the gadget for Apple.
Yesterday, an 18-year-old female worker at Foxconn became the fourth person in as many weeks to attempt suicide by jumping from one of the factory buildings...
The girl, only known by her surname, Rao, had only been working at Foxconn’s Longhua plant for a month...
On March 29, a 23-year-old man, named Liu, jumped out of a dormitory window at the Longhua plant at 3am, dressed only in his factory shirt and underwear.
On March 11, at 9.30pm, a worker in his twenties, named Li, jumped to his death, again at the Longhua plant. According to Chinese media reports, the man’s bonus was stolen at Chinese New Year.
Finally, on the morning of March 7, a female employee named Tian jumped from her dormitory building and injured herself, saying that she was under a great deal of pressure.
This, by the way, is not your average factory. It's as big as a small city:
The Longhua plant is the single largest assembly base in the world for computers, mobile phones and consumer electronics. Around 300,000 workers reportedly live and work there. To give you an idea of the scale of the place, one Foxconn consultant once told me that he had turned up at the wrong entrance to the factory and was told to travel to the next entrance along. The journey took half an hour by car.

Amid a furor over suicides at a major supplier, Apple Inc., AAPL 0.27% Hewlett-Packard Co. AAPL 0.27% and other electronics companies said they are examining conditions at the Chinese factory and how the supplier has responded to the spate of workers' deaths.
The suicides at Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., which assembles iPads for Apple, computers for H-P and cellphones for Nokia Corp. , have put unprecedented scrutiny on the secretive company and have highlighted the changing nature of China's work force.
The tech companies' promises to investigate came before another Hon Hai worker died Wednesday in what police said was a suicide, and as the company's hard-charging chairman, Terry Gou, moved to contain the fallout.
Wednesday's incident, reported by state-run Xinhua news agency, marks the 10th time an employee at Hon Hai's sprawling Longhua complex in the southern city of Shenzhen has jumped to his or her death this year, most since April, with two more injured in failed attempts.
Given China's overall suicide rate—about 14 per 100,000 people—the deaths aren't statistically exceptional, but the quick succession is unusual.
Earlier Wednesday, the company gave a group of journalists a tour of Longhua, a walled-off complex with guarded gates and about 400,000 workers, and announced plans to outfit worker dormitories with safety nets to prevent more workers from jumping to their deaths.
""These last two months, I've been afraid to answer the phone late at night or early in the morning, because we've been unable to prevent these incidents from happening,"" the 59-year-old Mr. Gou told reporters at Longhua, which has dozens of factory buildings and worker dormitories. He expressed ""regret"" over the incidents, but defended Hon Hai's response. ""We need time. But we have confidence and strong determination"" to address the problem, he said.
The statements Wednesday from Apple, H-P and others were the first public comment on the suicides by customers of Hon Hai, which also goes by the trade name Foxconn. The Taiwan-based company, which employs some 820,000 workers throughout China, is the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer by revenue.
""We are saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn,"" Apple said, adding it had assigned a team to evaluate Hon Hai's efforts to address the suicides. Apple said it's in contact with Hon Hai management and ""we believe they are taking this matter very seriously.""
H-P, the world's biggest PC maker, said it ""is investigating the Foxconn practices that may be associated with these tragic events."" Nokia said ""we have contacted Foxconn to ensure any issues are identified and addressed.""
Dell Inc. DELL -0.30% said, ""any reports of poor working conditions in Dell's supply chain are investigated and, if warranted, appropriate action is taken."" Other Hon Hai customers, including Motorola Inc. and Nintendo Co., made similar statements.
Such audits generally involve visual checks of the facilities and interviews with employees that companies say are designed to keep them free from management intimidation.
It would be difficult, though not impossible, for companies to extract Hon Hai from their supply chains, and so far none are suggesting that is under consideration. While there are other contract manufacturers, Hon Hai has made itself integral in their manufacturing processes—not to mention its ability to juggle secretive product launches from various clients without divulging secrets.
The deaths at Hon Hai have defied explanation. Their pattern resembles what psychologists call a ""suicide cluster,"" where one suicide triggers copycat acts, sometimes seen in schools or groups of young people.
Other companies have experienced suicide waves. France Télécom SA, which has around 180,000 staffers, has been under scrutiny after 35 suicides in 2008 and 2009, and another 13 this year.
Amid widening public concern, Chinese government officials have said they are looking into the deaths at Hon Hai. But so far authorities have suggested no wrongdoing by the company.
Labor rights activists say the deaths demonstrate problems with the way Hon Hai treats its staff. Workers are paid a base salary of 900 yuan a month, or about $132, the legal minimum wage, but most work overtime, which can pay 1.5 times or more the standard hourly rate.
Critics say Hon Hai compels or allows employees to work more than the legal number of overtime hours, and that its military-style rigor and repetitive working conditions create excessive stress on workers.
Still, the labor activists say Hon Hai's conditions are better than those at many factories in China, and that conditions have been improving in recent years.
Hon Hai defends its treatment of workers and their working conditions, and says its compensation and overtime practices follow local labor laws and the guidelines of an industry group. The company recently launched a series of antisuicide measures, from establishing a hotline to inviting Buddhist monks to pray for the factory.
""Parents put their children in our hands, and we provide them with work and living conditions, but also hope to give them a favorable mental and physical living environment,"" Mr. Gau said Wednesday. ""We haven't been able to prevent these incidents from happening in the last few months... In the future, we need to do even better.""
Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch, a New York-based group, said one problem is the Longhua plant has simply become too large. ""These young workers feel like there's no one caring for them,"" he said. Hon Hai's methods have failed to keep up with changes among the migrant workers who staff coastal factories like Longhua, he says.
Workers at tech firm Foxconn accuse the company's managaement of inhumanity and indifference to working conditions after another employee dies in tenth fall this year.
Mr. Li and other Chinese scholars and labor experts say workers from earlier generations, who hailed mainly from poor farms in China's hinterland, were accustomed to hard farm work and more single-mindedly focused on making money.
""The migrant workers of this generation are so different from earlier generations,"" says Li Guorui, a psychology professor at East China Normal University in Shanghai. Today's workers are aware of the chasm that separates their lives from the wealth of others in Chinese society.
After 19-year-old Li Hai jumped to his death Tuesday from a fifth-floor window of a training center, police found a suicide note apologizing to his family. The note indicated that Mr. Li had ""lost confidence in his future,"" and that ""his expectations of what he could do at work and for his family far outweighed what could be achieved,"" the Xinhua news agency reported, citing police.
While labor activists refer to Longhua as a sweatshop, it hardly has the look of Dickensian squalor the term connotes. On Wednesday, thousands of workers walked the palm tree-lined streets in colored uniforms bearing identification badges, while others ate in canteens boasting different regional cuisines.
The factory has a hospital and a bookstore. A banner advertised a karaoke contest. Liu Risheng, a 22-year-old employee who stood outside a cafeteria smoking a cigarette, said the pressure was manageable. ""People complain from time to time,"" he said, but ""it doesn't affect me much.""
Hon Hai's culture is built around the personality of Mr. Gou, who started making television channel-changing knobs with a loan from his mother and built Hon Hai into a titan with more than $60 billion in revenue last year. Mr. Gou combines intense drive with a martial leadership style. In a rare interview in 2007 with The Wall Street Journal, he described Genghis Khan, the 13th-century Mongolian conqueror, as a personal hero, and said ""I hate that I [have] become famous.""
Some actions taken by Hon Hai have worsened the bad publicity triggered by the suicide wave. Mr. Gou's announcement Wednesday that the company will install 1.5 million square meters of netting around its buildings was construed as a sign that it expects more jumpers. And the chairman was forced to publicly withdraw a letter to employees about the suicides Tuesday that was seen by some as insensitive.
The letter, which the company wanted employees to sign, included a section saying that workers or their families wouldn't sue Hon Hai if a worker died or was injured in a suicide attempt. Mr. Gou said the letter was poorly worded by Hon Hai's legal team.
Apple has been snared in controversy over Hon Hai before. Media reports of poor treatment of Longhua workers in 2006 prompted it to send a team to investigate. It found a handful of violations of its Supplier Code of Conduct, including workers exceeding its recommended 60-hour week, but said overall Hon Hai complied with its guidelines ""in the majority of areas."" Apple continues to inspect the plant regularly, as it does other suppliers.
Some Chinese analysts say the troubles at Hon Hai illustrate a need for change in how factory workers are treated. Hon Hai ""is a microcosm of China's labor system,"" said Guo Yuhua, a sociology professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

A Chinese company called Foxconn builds gadgets for Apple, Nintendo, HP and others. On July 9, one of its factory workers lost track of an iPhone prototype.
Days later, this worker, named Sun Danyong, leapt off a 12-story building and fell to his death in an apparent suicide.

Since, there have been allegations that Foxconn security guards roughed up Sun Danyong after the iPod prototype went missing and that this treatment led to his suicide.
Foxconn denies any connection, but Sun Danyong's family told the New York Times Foxconn paid them $44,000 after Sun Danyong death. Sun Danyong's girlfriend says Foxconn gave her a new Apple computer.
Are working conditions at the factories where our gadgets are made so miserable that they could push a worker to suicide?
We don't know. But here are two accounts of life in those factories.
The first is from a New York Times report following Sun Danyong's death. The second is from a report published by watchdog group China Labor Watch. It's supposedly written by a factory worker who makes $220 a month on the job. At the very least, it portrays working conditions few of us would tolerate.
The Times report:
A reporter toured two of the company’s campuses in Shenzhen on Friday, including the one where Mr. Sun worked. The campuses were so large they contained retail stores, banks, post offices and high-rise dormitories with outdoor swimming pools.
The reporter was not allowed to see manufacturing lines because the company said it had to protect trade secrets.
Outside the gates of one campus, most workers interviewed independently of the company said they were well treated. One of about 15 workers questioned admitted to being forced to work overtime above the legal limit.
The China Labor Watch report:
A Foxconn Worker's Story
I was raised in a farmer's family with five family members: my grandfather, parents, older brother and I. We own about eight acres of land, but since my grandfather is elderly, he cannot help my parents grow crops. My older brother is in college, and as for me, I am currently 19 years old, and just last month I was recruited by Foxconn through the arrangement my school. Besides the earnings from growing crops, there is no additional income for my family. In the past, we had owed some money to relatives because my parents had to support my brother and my education. Since I just graduated from a technical school, I was able to leave home to work and send some money home to pay for my brother's education and other debts.
After graduation, I was told by my school that it could arrange for my classmates and me to work at Shenzhen Foxconn. The school then gave us an introduction of Foxconn. At that time, I knew Foxconn's campus in Shenzhen is huge, but had no idea just how big it was until I got there.There were about 200 of us, guided by school teachers heading to Shenzhen. It took us about 30 hours by train and then by bus to reach Shenzhen Foxconn.
I was placed in a dormitory that has ten three-level bunk beds, thus accomodating 30 people. While many people refused to stay there at that time, the management said that it is much better than the other dormitories on site that are shared by hundreds of workers. Although I still had some negative feelings towards the dorm room, at the same time, I felt lucky for not having to live in a dorm room shared by hundreds. Just the second day living in the dorm, however, I found my safe box open, and my walkman gone. There was nothing I could do but to try to tell myself that I was lucky because it was not that expensive.
The training begins immediately on the second day upon our arrival. At first I thought we would be informed of some professional operative skills and knowledge, but instead, we were taught the factory's regulations, culture, and acknowledgment of Foxconn's business concept. By now, I think it is safe to say that the training is a part of Foxconn's brain washing process. A supervisor told us that working at Foxconn requires total obedience. you do not need to be intelligent or highly skilled. After a week of training, we concluded that at Foxconn, we shouldn't treat ourselves as human beings, we are just machines. During the week, we also had a health examination, a very simple blood test, a blood pressure test and a vision test. We did not receive any results afterwards.
After the one week of in-class training, we begin our on-site training, which is a modest way of telling us that we have to work as long as regular workers, with minimal compensation. Since we are still under training, Foxconn did not give us a contract to sign.
I consider myself lucky because one week after the on-site training I was selected by a CCPBG recruiter, which means I am officially a regular worker. When the selection takes place, it seems like a slave market where slave owners get to pick suitable slaves. There were about a couple hundred of us going through on-site training, and when the recruiters from other companies on Foxconn campus come, all of us have to stand straight in lines, putting our hands behind our backs, and wait for these recruiters to pick. After the selection ends, those who did not get picked go back to their work post. They cannot become regular workers until being picked so I was very lucky to be selected the first week. Many of my classmates are still doing on-site training waiting to be picked.
Twenty people including myself were selected and brought to the workshop where I will finally begin as a regular worker. First, the supervisor and assistant manager explain to us the rules of the workshop: no talking at work, no leaving work post at will, and etc. Then, the section supervisor gave us a lecture, emphasizing that we are no longer in school and that we have to work hard. Afterwards, I was assigned to my post, and few days later, I was offered a contract to sign. Since I was very inexperienced at that time, I did not even look at the contract details, and I still have yet to take a look at what exactly is on my contract.
My work post at that time was connecting computer wires. Later, I was assigned to another production line that produces CD-ROMs. I believe the whole workshop is producing for Sony.
Everyday I wake up at 7 AM, head to the workshop at 7:30 AM, place all personal items that contain metal, such as mobile phones, keys, pens and etc., into the shoe shelf, change into my uniform, and begin working at 8 AM. Although CCPBG states that work begins at 8 AM, it actually requires workers to be present at the workshop by 7:30 AM, and those 30 minutes are unpaid.
My current position is at the end of the production belt, installing four screws onto each CD-ROM case. At first I was not very skilled, and many times, either I was not able to install screws fast enough, decelerating the production or the screws were too loose. Thus the first week, I was often insulted by my supervisor. It was at that time when many workers decided to quit, not having been paid the adequate wages that we deserved. Like those workers, I was on the verge of quitting, but after I thought about my brother's education, and my family's limited income, I stayed. I am much better at my job now, though the speed of the production line moves so quickly that I have to continue to install screws on the CD-ROMs nonstop until lunch time, which is at noon. Before exiting the workshop, we have to go through a metal detector test, and if the alarm goes off, security will need to conduct a search to find the cause. If the cause is not work-related, we are allowed to pass.
We have a one hour lunch break. During break, the whole campus is filled with people, and we have to be very careful not to run into anyone. The situation in the canteen is even worse, and I generally have to wait more than ten minutes to get the meal. The lunch meal consists of two meat dishes and one vegetable dish, and rice is self-service, though I don't recommend taking too much rice since left over rice results in a fine. Since I always finish what I have on the plate, I am not too certain of the details of the fine.
At 1 PM, we return to our work and continue what was left off earlier this morning. The afternoon is the most difficult part of the day, and since there is no time for nap after lunch, I often feel drowsy. We get off work at 5 PM, have dinner, rest for a while, and then at 6 PM overtime begins. We usually get off work at 8 PM, having completed two hours of overtime. However, if we were unable to complete the production quota in the allotted time, we would be insulted by supervisors and asked to work until the quota is reached. Moreover, those additional hours are unpaid. I was told by other experienced workers that each month there are about ten overtime hours uncounted, excluding the extra 30 minutes of unpaid work each morning.
Since I have been standing at the same spot working for more than ten hours, when I return to the dorm at night, I feel so exhausted and don't want to move. The dormitory is very inconvenient. I have to walk to the other side of the dormitory to take a shower, drink water, or use the bathroom. Since there's only one shower room on each floor, I often have to wait for a long time before I can take a shower and go to sleep.
Although the dormitory is free, my classmate and I decided to move out for safety reasons. Now, I live in a one bedroom apartment about 25 minutes' drive from Foxconn. The rent is 300 RMB and we split the cost. Including the bus fare, which is 4 RMB roundtrip, about 120 RMB a month, I spend about a total of 270 RMB a month. Although I have to wake up much earlier to go to work, I feel much safer.
I was told by other workers that it is difficult to distinguish between peak and slow season at Foxconn. When it is busy, we have to work more than ten hours a day and most likely get one off day a month. When work is slow, we still have to work over ten hours a day, though we have three to four off days a month. This month I have only two off days, and since the crime rate at where I live is high, and I have often heard cases of robberies nearby, I usually stay home when I don't have to work. When my classmate and I miss our homes, we cook some of our local dishes as a remedy to our homesickness.
There is too much pressure during the day. I never have time to think, and only at night would I think about my parents at home. I want to call them, but there's no time to call during the day, and at night, I feel guilty calling because my parents are probably exhausted from working in the field all day. The only chance I have to call them is on my off days. Perhaps in the future, when the company switchs me to night shifts I would have more opportunities to call home.
As for the future, I have not thought about it yet. Currently I earn about 1,500 RMB a month, which includes the minimum wage of 750 RMB and all the overtime hours I have worked. I will continue to work at Foxconn until my brother graduates and all the debts in the family paid off. Life is too difficult here. I feel like I have no self-esteem.

Yahoo!7 July 22, 2009, 3:33 pm
A Chinese factory worker who reported the loss of a fourth generation iPhone prototype has committed suicide, an online tech website has reported.
VentureBeat reported Sun Danyong, a 25-year-old Foxconn employee, jumped out of a 12th-floor window because he was afraid of his bosses.
Sun had ordered a number of prototype phones from Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn's assembly line, but had reportedly lost one within days of receiving them.
His apartment was searched by Foxconn employees after he reported the device missing on July 13.
He reportedly committed suicide three days later, with CCTV showing he had jumped out of the window at 3:30am.
Chinese Media reported that Sun was beaten and harshly interrogated by his superiors, and the apartment search was highly illegal.
The incident has been confirmed, with a spokesman telling reporters Apple was ""saddened by the tragic loss of this young employee.""
Apple is usually very secretive about upcoming releases of its products, and misplacing prototypes is a major breach of protocol.
Apple has previously come under criticism over the working conditions in the Chinese factories where their iPods are made.
Britain's Daily Mail once reported workers toiled for up to 15 hours a day and ""were ruled with an iron fist by their bosses.""

It has come to define a generation. In just five years, Apple's iPod has become one of the most popular and iconic gadgets around. More than two
million people in Britain own one, and last year alone 22.5million were bought worldwide: a phenomenal 61,644 a day.
The distinctive digital audio players – which can store thousands of songs, photos and even full-length films – have turned California-based Apple into one of the world's most profitable companies, earning founder Steve Jobs a
$3billion fortune.
Last year Apple achieved a record billion-dollar profit, boosted by the launch of its latest Nano model, which is the width of a pencil and weighs
just 1.5oz. A million Nanos were sold in just 17 days, including one to Pope Benedict XVI.
But have you ever wondered where your iPod is made, and what's in it?
The Mail on Sunday has traced the incredible journey an iPod makes from conception to completion, and uncovers the harsh working conditions in the Chinese factories where iPods are made.
Although it is one of America's most prestigious brands, nearly all Apple computers and iPods are made abroad, predominantly in China. As you might expect, the workers who assemble them see little of the profit.
The first factory we visited was in Longhua, just 20 miles from Hong Kong. Run by Taiwanese company Foxconn, it is the original and largest plant to be built in mainland China.
It's a sprawling place where 200,000 people work and sleep – meaning this iPod City has a population bigger than Newcastle's.
Arriving at the gates, the visitor is initially struck by the giant billboards inviting anyone over 16, the legal working age here, to apply for jobs.
Workers live in dormitories on the site, 100 to a room, arriving with a few possessions and a bucket to wash their clothes. The accommodation may be free, but it comes at a cost – no one outside the plant is allowed to visit
the workers.
Security is high everywhere, but especially in the five-storey E3 factory which makes the Nanos.
Police – not security guards – are stationed on all gates, studiously checking those entering and leaving the site to thwart rivals intent on
industrial espionage.
Zang Lan, 21, from Zhengzhou in central China, has worked on the Apple assembly line for a month. Her 15-hour days earn her £27 a month – about half the wage weavers earned in Liverpool and Manchester in 1805, allowing for
inflation.
This is low, even for China, but Zhengzhou is a particularly poor region so workers would accept even less.
'The job here is so-so,' Zang Lan says. 'We have to work too hard and I am always tired. It's like being in the army. They make us stand still for hours. If we move we are punished by being made to stand still for longer.
The boys are made to do push-ups.' Every morning the workers, in beige jackets to denote their junior status, are taken up to the factory roof for a military-style drill.
'We have to work overtime if we are told to and can only go back to the dormitories when our boss gives us permission,' says Zang Lan. 'If they ask for overtime we must do it.
After working 15 hours until 11.30pm, we feel so
tired.' Foxconn, one of the world's biggest IT companies, is currently investing £31million in plants in Beijing and Suzhou to take advantage of China's cheap workforce.
A fifth of Foxconn's million-strong workforce is deployed here, working on other Apple products, including computers. Only a tiny proportion of workers are allowed to make iPods.
The second iPod plant we visit, in the industrial area of Suzhou on the borders of Shanghai, belongs to the Asustek company. Here workers produce more than two million motherboards and 150,000 laptops a month, as well as the popular iPod Shuffle.
The site, as large as eight football pitches, is surrounded by barbed wire. It employs 50,000 workers and its six gates are manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with particular attention paid to gate five which leads to
factory eight – the home of the iPod Shuffle.
Here the dormitories are outside the plant, and we spoke to some of the workers at the end of their working day. Although the proximity to Shanghai means they are better paid than their Foxconn counterparts, earning up to £54
a month, they have to pay for dormitories and food, which takes up half their salaries.
Working up to 12 hours a day, their only freedom is the half-hour walk to and from work.
One 26-year-old security guard, who would not reveal his name, earns £ 80 a month.
'Factory eight is mostly made up of women as they are more honest than men,' he tells us. ' The iPod Shuffle is very easy to steal because it is so small.' The guard is virtually the only person we interviewed in the communist run country who understood the implications of China's cheap labour force.
'Payment is lower because the boss wants to reduce our costs,' he says. 'Prices need to be competitive to get orders from abroad.' Which is
exactly why Apple makes its products in China.
The Nano contains 400 parts that together cost an estimated £41. The tiny flash memory card, which stores thousands of songs, is by far the most expensive part at £25.
Made in Korea, flash memory, which replays the music without skipping when the user moves, is extremely robust. That was proved when staff on a technology website ran over their iPod in a car. The screen broke, but the music played on.
The amplifier comes from Edinburgh-based Wolfson Microelectronics, whose audio converter translates the digital information into buzz-free analogue sound. This essential component, costing just 85p, makes an 8,500-mile journey to be assembled in China.
Batteries cost £2.60 each, and the headphones and the ClickWheel used to select tracks each cost 45p. Labour costs in the Chinese factories we traced are a further £4.20 per iPod.
Everything considered, the total cost of manufacturing an iPod Nano is around £41. In Britain they sell for between £109 and £179.
Still, putting together an iPod's hundreds of components is a task of fiendish complexity and mindboggling logistical efficiency.
For an idea of the global nature of business, consider just one component, the Nano's central PortalPlayer microchip. The chip's core technology is licensed from British firm ARMthen modified by PortalPlayer's programmers in
California, Washington state and Hyderabad, India. The finished chip will carry about one million lines of code.
PortalPlayer works with microchip design companies eSilicon and LSI Logic, both based in California's Silicon Valley, who send the finished design to a 'foundry' in Taiwan.
These sites can cost up to £1.5billion to set up, and represent the most complex aspect of chip construction.
They produce thousands of 'wafers' – thin metal discs imprinted with hundreds of thousands of chips. These are sent out to be cut up into
individual discs, which go on to Taiwan, where each is tested individually.
The chips are then encased in plastic and readied for assembly by Silicon-Ware in Taiwan and Amkor in Korea.
The finished microchip is sent to a warehouse in Hong Kong, then transported to the plants in mainland China, where the iPods are put together, before being shipped worldwide.
Will Sturgeon, managing editor of IT website silicon.com, said such global operations are now commonplace.
'Apple are only one of thousands of companies manufacturing their products in the same places and in the same conditions,' he said. 'It's the nature of big business today to exploit any opportunity that comes their way.'
James Kynge, author of China Shakes The World, argues that despite Westerners' perceptions about working conditions in factories, the wages are a godsend that are transforming rural China. 'The money sent back to farming families
from the workers now exceeds the amount made from agriculture,' he says.
'Because China has no independent unions, subcontractors like Foxconn are able to keep wages artificially low. Workers will be lucky if they make two per cent of the profit from an iPod. Foxconn will make less than ten per
cent. Far more money is spent by Apple on marketing the product than making it.'
China misses out on this lucrative market because its poor global reputation means it has not been able to build its own worldwide brands.
'Even if the Chinese made their own version of the iPod and sold it at a fraction of the price, no one would buy it,' says Kynge. 'Consumers respond to the Apple logo, not the people in Chinese factories making the products.'

Steve Jobs' Think Different campaign celebrated labor leaders like Gandhi, who used strikes as a form of civil protest, and Ceasar Chavez, who organized poor, migrant farm workers. But a British newspaper at the weekend published a rather shocking report about the factories in China that make his company's iPods.
A report in the middlebrow Mail on Sunday entitled ""iPod City"" features photos and first-hand accounts from inside factories operated by Foxconn, a company contracted by Apple to assemble millions of iPods by hand.
According to the report (paraphrased here by Macworld UK), Foxconn's giant Longhua plant employs 200,000 workers, who work 15-hour days but are paid just $50 a month – miserable even by China's standards. It claims they work and live in the plant, in dormitories housing 100 people, and outside visitors are forbidden.
The report says another plant that makes Apple's iPod shuffle in Suzhou, Shanghai, employs mostly women, because they are more trustworthy. Another factory is secured by Chinese police officers, the paper said.
Workers at these factories earn more – about $100 a month – but are not housed by the company. The paper says rent and living costs eat up about half the worker's salaries.
It should be no surprise that Chinese factory workers are low paid but the report makes conditions sound positively Dickensian.
The situation is too murky for a rush to judgment on Apple's ethics here, and it may well meet minimum global standards. But for a company that has staked its image on progressive politics, Apple has set itself up as a potential lightning rod on global labor standards. Sweatshops came back to bite Nike after its customers rose up in arms. and Apple can expect a similar grilling from its upscale Volvo-driving fans in the months ahead.
Tech companies' records in China are in the spotlight for a wide variety of human rights issues. Google and Yahoo have weathered a lot of criticism – quite rightly – for censoring search results and cooperating with the Chinese authorities cracking down on dissidents. I'm not nave enough to expect companies to behave morally like individuals, but I find Google's corporate mantra ""Don't be evil"" to be especially galling. They dropped that one pretty quick.
All of this should put Apple on notice that doing business in China in anything less than an exemplary fashion is a recipe for a PR disaster.
It's undisputed that most of Apple's products are made and assembled in China. In recent financial filings, Apple says most of its manufacturing is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea and Singapore. and assembled in China.
""Final assembly of substantially all of the Company's portable products including MacBook Pro, iBooks and iPods is performed by third-party vendors in China,"" the report says.
Apple is just one of myriad companies using Chinese factories to make its products. And of course, it does so purely because of China's low wages and other costs.
The iPod is assembled by Inventec and Foxconn, two manufacturers headquartered in Taiwan that own factories in China and elsewhere. Foxconn is a trade name of Hon Hai Precision Industry, a $16 billion giant and one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, which makes everything from Playstations for Sony to iPods for Apple.
According to a BusinessWeek profile, Hon Hai employs about 100,000 people in China. It's hard to imagine the staff at the giant Longhua plant swelling to more than 200,000 workers, which would make it bigger than the city of Spokane, Washington, no matter how many iPods Apple sells.
Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the pro-globalization International Institute for Economics, said Hon Hai has an ""excellent reputation."" He says factories in China operated by big global companies like Hon Hai are very different from smaller, indigenous operations. International giants usually enforce the same work practices in China as they do in other parts of Asia, or Europe and United States, according to Lardy.
Lardy said he had no specific knowledge of Hon Hai's facilities, but plants he's visited in China run by competitors like Jabil Circuits could be located in the United States or Europe.
""Other companies' factories are pristine,"" he said. ""They could be anywhere.""
However, Dan Viederman, executive director of Verit, a non-profit social research firm, said that while Chinese factories in the high-tech sector often comply to international standards on issues like the handling of toxic substances, they fall short on labor practices.
Viederman said Chinese manufacturers are getting better at environmental issues thanks to tough laws in countries where the goods are sold, like the European Union's directive on eliminating toxins in electronics. But in other areas – especially labor law – they are lagging.
""We see endemically excessively long hours, health and safety violations, underpayment of wages or overtime premiums,"" he said. ""Also, there's no labor unions.""
China Labor Watch says one of the most serious labor issues in China is the inability of workers to organize.
""The root of abuse is the knowledge on the part of both governments and companies that, no matter how workers are treated or what they are paid, investment will continue to pour in and goods to pour out,"" the site says.
Christopher Foss, spokesman for Social Accountability International, a non-profit human-rights organization, said the technology industry is starting to get a reputation for poor overseas labor practices.
In the past, sweatshops were associated with certain industries like apparel, food and mineral extraction, but as technology requires more low-skill assemblers than highly-trained manufacturers, it's starting to get a bad rep, he said.
""There's a lot of menial tasks in sub-par positions,"" he said. ""It used to be high tech was well trained and well paid, but it's the same race to the bottom. There are problems now emerging in the technology sector.""
However, Foss said at least one of Hon Hai's facilities has been certified to the SAI's SA8000 labor standard, which is based on principles established by the International Labour Organization and the United Nations. ""The facility has recently been found to be free of basic human rights violations based on ILO and U.N. norms,"" he said.
That may be so, but Apple needs to not only meet minimum standards, but set an example by exceeding them. It's the right thing to do of course, but it's also smart business–something Jobs should surely understand. For Apple's demographic – well-heeled urbanites – human rights and labor practices are, presumably, important matters. They buy fair-trade coffee, but iBooks and iPods are not an issue?
Not yet, but there's every reason to believe they will be.

The explosion ripped through Building A5 on a Friday evening last May, an eruption of fire and noise that twisted metal pipes as if they were discarded straws.
When workers in the cafeteria ran outside, they saw black smoke pouring from shattered windows. It came from the area where employees polished thousands of iPad cases a day.
Two people were killed immediately, and over a dozen others hurt. As the injured were rushed into ambulances, one in particular stood out. His features had been smeared by the blast, scrubbed by heat and violence until a mat of red and black had replaced his mouth and nose.
“Are you Lai Xiaodong’s father?” a caller asked when the phone rang at Mr. Lai’s childhood home. Six months earlier, the 22-year-old had moved to Chengdu, in southwest China, to become one of the millions of human cogs powering the largest, fastest and most sophisticated manufacturing system on earth. That system has made it possible for Apple and hundreds of other companies to build devices almost as quickly as they can be dreamed up.
“He’s in trouble,” the caller told Mr. Lai’s father. “Get to the hospital as soon as possible.”

In the last decade, Apple has become one of the mightiest, richest and most successful companies in the world, in part by mastering global manufacturing. Apple and its high-technology peers — as well as dozens of other American industries — have achieved a pace of innovation nearly unmatched in modern history.
However, the workers assembling iPhones, iPads and other devices often labor in harsh conditions, according to employees inside those plants, worker advocates and documents published by companies themselves. Problems are as varied as onerous work environments and serious — sometimes deadly — safety problems.
Employees work excessive overtime, in some cases seven days a week, and live in crowded dorms. Some say they stand so long that their legs swell until they can hardly walk. Under-age workers have helped build Apple’s products, and the company’s suppliers have improperly disposed of hazardous waste and falsified records, according to company reports and advocacy groups that, within China, are often considered reliable, independent monitors.
More troubling, the groups say, is some suppliers’ disregard for workers’ health. Two years ago, 137 workers at an Apple supplier in eastern China were injured after they were ordered to use a poisonous chemical to clean iPhone screens. Within seven months last year, two explosions at iPad factories, including in Chengdu, killed four people and injured 77. Before those blasts, Apple had been alerted to hazardous conditions inside the Chengdu plant, according to a Chinese group that published that warning.
“If Apple was warned, and didn’t act, that’s reprehensible,” said Nicholas Ashford, a former chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health, a group that advises the United States Labor Department. “But what’s morally repugnant in one country is accepted business practices in another, and companies take advantage of that.”
Apple is not the only electronics company doing business within a troubling supply system. Bleak working conditions have been documented at factories manufacturing products for Dell, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Lenovo, Motorola, Nokia, Sony, Toshiba and others.
Current and former Apple executives, moreover, say the company has made significant strides in improving factories in recent years. Apple has a supplier code of conduct that details standards on labor issues, safety protections and other topics. The company has mounted a vigorous auditing campaign, and when abuses are discovered, Apple says, corrections are demanded.
And Apple’s annual supplier responsibility reports, in many cases, are the first to report abuses. This month, for the first time, the company released a list identifying many of its suppliers.
But significant problems remain. More than half of the suppliers audited by Apple have violated at least one aspect of the code of conduct every year since 2007, according to Apple’s reports, and in some instances have violated the law. While many violations involve working conditions, rather than safety hazards, troubling patterns persist.
“Apple never cared about anything other than increasing product quality and decreasing production cost,” said Li Mingqi, who until April worked in management at Foxconn Technology, one of Apple’s most important manufacturing partners. Mr. Li, who is suing Foxconn over his dismissal, helped manage the Chengdu factory where the explosion occurred.
“Workers’ welfare has nothing to do with their interests,” he said.
Some former Apple executives say there is an unresolved tension within the company: executives want to improve conditions within factories, but that dedication falters when it conflicts with crucial supplier relationships or the fast delivery of new products. Tuesday, Apple reported one of the most lucrative quarters of any corporation in history, with $13.06 billion in profits on $46.3 billion in sales. Its sales would have been even higher, executives said, if overseas factories had been able to produce more.
Executives at other corporations report similar internal pressures. This system may not be pretty, they argue, but a radical overhaul would slow innovation. Customers want amazing new electronics delivered every year.
“We’ve known about labor abuses in some factories for four years, and they’re still going on,” said one former Apple executive who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. “Why? Because the system works for us. Suppliers would change everything tomorrow if Apple told them they didn’t have another choice.”
“If half of iPhones were malfunctioning, do you think Apple would let it go on for four years?” the executive asked.
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

Apple, in its published reports, has said it requires every discovered labor violation to be remedied, and suppliers that refuse are terminated. Privately, however, some former executives concede that finding new suppliers is time-consuming and costly. Foxconn is one of the few manufacturers in the world with the scale to build sufficient numbers of iPhones and iPads. So Apple is “not going to leave Foxconn and they’re not going to leave China,” said Heather White, a research fellow at Harvard and a former member of the Monitoring International Labor Standards committee at the National Academy of Sciences. “There’s a lot of rationalization.”
Apple was provided with extensive summaries of this article, but the company declined to comment. The reporting is based on interviews with more than three dozen current or former employees and contractors, including a half-dozen current or former executives with firsthand knowledge of Apple’s supplier responsibility group, as well as others within the technology industry.
In 2010, Steven P. Jobs discussed the company’s relationships with suppliers at an industry conference.
“I actually think Apple does one of the best jobs of any companies in our industry, and maybe in any industry, of understanding the working conditions in our supply chain,” said Mr. Jobs, who was Apple’s chief executive at the time and who died last October.
“I mean, you go to this place, and, it’s a factory, but, my gosh, I mean, they’ve got restaurants and movie theaters and hospitals and swimming pools, and I mean, for a factory, it’s a pretty nice factory.”
Others, including workers inside such plants, acknowledge the cafeterias and medical facilities, but insist conditions are punishing.
“We’re trying really hard to make things better,” said one former Apple executive. “But most people would still be really disturbed if they saw where their iPhone comes from.”
The Road to Chengdu
In the fall of 2010, about six months before the explosion in the iPad factory, Lai Xiaodong carefully wrapped his clothes around his college diploma, so it wouldn’t crease in his suitcase. He told friends he would no longer be around for their weekly poker games, and said goodbye to his teachers. He was leaving for Chengdu, a city of 12 million that was rapidly becoming one of the world’s most important manufacturing hubs.
Though painfully shy, Mr. Lai had surprised everyone by persuading a beautiful nursing student to become his girlfriend. She wanted to marry, she said, and so his goal was to earn enough money to buy an apartment.
Factories in Chengdu manufacture products for hundreds of companies. But Mr. Lai was focused on Foxconn Technology, China’s largest exporter and one of the nation’s biggest employers, with 1.2 million workers. The company has plants throughout China, and assembles an estimated 40 percent of the world’s consumer electronics, including for customers like Amazon, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Nintendo, Nokia and Samsung.
Foxconn’s factory in Chengdu, Mr. Lai knew, was special. Inside, workers were building Apple’s latest, potentially greatest product: the iPad.
When Mr. Lai finally landed a job repairing machines at the plant, one of the first things he noticed were the almost blinding lights. Shifts ran 24 hours a day, and the factory was always bright. At any moment, there were thousands of workers standing on assembly lines or sitting in backless chairs, crouching next to large machinery, or jogging between loading bays. Some workers’ legs swelled so much they waddled. “It’s hard to stand all day,” said Zhao Sheng, a plant worker.
Banners on the walls warned the 120,000 employees: “Work hard on the job today or work hard to find a job tomorrow.” Apple’s supplier code of conduct dictates that, except in unusual circumstances, employees are not supposed to work more than 60 hours a week. But at Foxconn, some worked more, according to interviews, workers’ pay stubs and surveys by outside groups. Mr. Lai was soon spending 12 hours a day, six days a week inside the factory, according to his paychecks. Employees who arrived late were sometimes required to write confession letters and copy quotations. There were “continuous shifts,” when workers were told to work two stretches in a row, according to interviews.
Mr. Lai’s college degree enabled him to earn a salary of around $22 a day, including overtime — more than many others. When his days ended, he would retreat to a small bedroom just big enough for a mattress, wardrobe and a desk where he obsessively played an online game called Fight the Landlord, said his girlfriend, Luo Xiaohong.
Those accommodations were better than many of the company’s dorms, where 70,000 Foxconn workers lived, at times stuffed 20 people to a three-room apartment, employees said. Last year, a dispute over paychecks set off a riot in one of the dormitories, and workers started throwing bottles, trash cans and flaming paper from their windows, according to witnesses. Two hundred police officers wrestled with workers, arresting eight. Afterward, trash cans were removed, and piles of rubbish — and rodents — became a problem. Mr. Lai felt lucky to have a place of his own.
Foxconn, in a statement, disputed workers’ accounts of continuous shifts, extended overtime, crowded living accommodations and the causes of the riot. The company said that its operations adhered to customers’ codes of conduct, industry standards and national laws. “Conditions at Foxconn are anything but harsh,” the company wrote. Foxconn also said that it had never been cited by a customer or government for under-age or overworked employees or toxic exposures.
“All assembly line employees are given regular breaks, including one-hour lunch breaks,” the company wrote, and only 5 percent of assembly line workers are required to stand to carry out their tasks. Work stations have been designed to ergonomic standards, and employees have opportunities for job rotation and promotion, the statement said.
“Foxconn has a very good safety record,” the company wrote. “Foxconn has come a long way in our efforts to lead our industry in China in areas such as workplace conditions and the care and treatment of our employees.”
Apple’s Code of Conduct
In 2005, some of Apple’s top executives gathered inside their Cupertino, Calif., headquarters for a special meeting. Other companies had created codes of conduct to police their suppliers. It was time, Apple decided, to follow suit. The code Apple published that year demands “that working conditions in Apple’s supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.”
But the next year, a British newspaper, The Mail on Sunday, secretly visited a Foxconn factory in Shenzhen, China, where iPods were manufactured, and reported on workers’ long hours, push-ups meted out as punishment and crowded dorms. Executives in Cupertino were shocked. “Apple is filled with really good people who had no idea this was going on,” a former employee said. “We wanted it changed, immediately.”

Apple audited that factory, the company’s first such inspection, and ordered improvements. Executives also undertook a series of initiatives that included an annual audit report, first published in 2007. By last year, Apple had inspected 396 facilities — including the company’s direct suppliers, as well as many of those suppliers’ suppliers — one of the largest such programs within the electronics industry.
Those audits have found consistent violations of Apple’s code of conduct, according to summaries published by the company. In 2007, for instance, Apple conducted over three dozen audits, two-thirds of which indicated that employees regularly worked more than 60 hours a week. In addition, there were six “core violations,” the most serious kind, including hiring 15-year-olds as well as falsifying records.
Over the next three years, Apple conducted 312 audits, and every year, about half or more showed evidence of large numbers of employees laboring more than six days a week as well as working extended overtime. Some workers received less than minimum wage or had pay withheld as punishment. Apple found 70 core violations over that period, including cases of involuntary labor, under-age workers, record falsifications, improper disposal of hazardous waste and over a hundred workers injured by toxic chemical exposures.
Last year, the company conducted 229 audits. There were slight improvements in some categories and the detected rate of core violations declined. However, within 93 facilities, at least half of workers exceeded the 60-hours-a-week work limit. At a similar number, employees worked more than six days a week. There were incidents of discrimination, improper safety precautions, failure to pay required overtime rates and other violations. That year, four employees were killed and 77 injured in workplace explosions.
“If you see the same pattern of problems, year after year, that means the company’s ignoring the issue rather than solving it,” said one former Apple executive with firsthand knowledge of the supplier responsibility group. “Noncompliance is tolerated, as long as the suppliers promise to try harder next time. If we meant business, core violations would disappear.”
Apple says that when an audit reveals a violation, the company requires suppliers to address the problem within 90 days and make changes to prevent a recurrence. “If a supplier is unwilling to change, we terminate our relationship,” the company says on its Web site.
The seriousness of that threat, however, is unclear. Apple has found violations in hundreds of audits, but fewer than 15 suppliers have been terminated for transgressions since 2007, according to former Apple executives.
“Once the deal is set and Foxconn becomes an authorized Apple supplier, Apple will no longer give any attention to worker conditions or anything that is irrelevant to its products,” said Mr. Li, the former Foxconn manager. Mr. Li spent seven years with Foxconn in Shenzhen and Chengdu and was forced out in April after he objected to a relocation to Chengdu, he said. Foxconn disputed his comments, and said “both Foxconn and Apple take the welfare of our employees very seriously.”
Apple’s efforts have spurred some changes. Facilities that were reaudited “showed continued performance improvements and better working conditions,” the company wrote in its 2011 supplier responsibility progress report. In addition, the number of audited facilities has grown every year, and some executives say those expanding efforts obscure year-to-year improvements.
Apple also has trained over a million workers about their rights and methods for injury and disease prevention. A few years ago, after auditors insisted on interviewing low-level factory employees, they discovered that some had been forced to pay onerous “recruitment fees” — which Apple classifies as involuntary labor. As of last year, the company had forced suppliers to reimburse more than $6.7 million in such charges.
“Apple is a leader in preventing under-age labor,” said Dionne Harrison of Impactt, a firm paid by Apple to help prevent and respond to child labor among its suppliers. “They’re doing as much as they possibly can.”
Other consultants disagree.
“We’ve spent years telling Apple there are serious problems and recommending changes,” said a consultant at BSR — also known as Business for Social Responsibility — which has been twice retained by Apple to provide advice on labor issues. “They don’t want to pre-empt problems, they just want to avoid embarrassments.”
‘We Could Have Saved Lives’
In 2006, BSR, along with a division of the World Bank and other groups, initiated a project to improve working conditions in factories building cellphones and other devices in China and elsewhere. The groups and companies pledged to test various ideas. Foxconn agreed to participate.
For four months, BSR and another group negotiated with Foxconn regarding a pilot program to create worker “hotlines,” so that employees could report abusive conditions, seek mental counseling and discuss workplace problems. Apple was not a participant in the project, but was briefed on it, according to the BSR consultant, who had detailed knowledge.
As negotiations proceeded, Foxconn’s requirements for participation kept changing. First Foxconn asked to shift from installing new hotlines to evaluating existing hotlines. Then Foxconn insisted that mental health counseling be excluded. Foxconn asked participants to sign agreements saying they would not disclose what they observed, and then rewrote those agreements multiple times. Finally, an agreement was struck, and the project was scheduled to begin in January 2008. A day before the start, Foxconn demanded more changes, until it was clear the project would not proceed, according to the consultant and a 2008 summary by BSR that did not name Foxconn.
The next year, a Foxconn employee fell or jumped from an apartment building after losing an iPhone prototype. Over the next two years, at least 18 other Foxconn workers attempted suicide or fell from buildings in manners that suggested suicide attempts. In 2010, two years after the pilot program fell apart and after multiple suicide attempts, Foxconn created a dedicated mental health hotline and began offering free psychological counseling.
“We could have saved lives, and we asked Apple to pressure Foxconn, but they wouldn’t do it,” said the BSR consultant, who asked not to be identified because of confidentiality agreements. “Companies like H.P. and Intel and Nike push their suppliers. But Apple wants to keep an arm’s length, and Foxconn is their most important manufacturer, so they refuse to push.”
BSR, in a written statement, said the views of that consultant were not those of the company.
“My BSR colleagues and I view Apple as a company that is making a highly serious effort to ensure that labor conditions in its supply chain meet the expectations of applicable laws, the company’s standards and the expectations of consumers,” wrote Aron Cramer, BSR’s president. Mr. Cramer added that asking Apple to pressure Foxconn would have been inconsistent with the purpose of the pilot program, and there were multiple reasons the pilot program did not proceed.
Foxconn, in a statement, said it acted quickly and comprehensively to address suicides, and “the record has shown that those measures have been successful.”
A Demanding Client
Every month, officials at companies from around the world trek to Cupertino or invite Apple executives to visit their foreign factories, all in pursuit of a goal: becoming a supplier.
A JOB TURNS DEADLY
A JOB TURNS DEADLYAluminum dust from polishing iPads caused the blast at Foxconn's plant in Chengdu, left. Lai Xiaodong was among those killed. He had moved to Chengdu, bringing with him his college diploma, six months earlier.
When news arrives that Apple is interested in a particular product or service, small celebrations often erupt. Whiskey is drunk. Karaoke is sung.
Then, Apple’s requests start.
Apple typically asks suppliers to specify how much every part costs, how many workers are needed and the size of their salaries. Executives want to know every financial detail. Afterward, Apple calculates how much it will pay for a part. Most suppliers are allowed only the slimmest of profits.
So suppliers often try to cut corners, replace expensive chemicals with less costly alternatives, or push their employees to work faster and longer, according to people at those companies.
“The only way you make money working for Apple is figuring out how to do things more efficiently or cheaper,” said an executive at one company that helped bring the iPad to market. “And then they’ll come back the next year, and force a 10 percent price cut.”
In January 2010, workers at a Chinese factory owned by Wintek, an Apple manufacturing partner, went on strike over a variety of issues, including widespread rumors that workers were being exposed to toxins. Investigations by news organizations revealed that over a hundred employees had been injured by n-hexane, a toxic chemical that can cause nerve damage and paralysis.
Employees said they had been ordered to use n-hexane to clean iPhone screens because it evaporated almost three times as fast as rubbing alcohol. Faster evaporation meant workers could clean more screens each minute.
Apple commented on the Wintek injuries a year later. In its supplier responsibility report, Apple said it had “required Wintek to stop using n-hexane” and that “Apple has verified that all affected workers have been treated successfully, and we continue to monitor their medical reports until full recuperation.” Apple also said it required Wintek to fix the ventilation system.
That same month, a New York Times reporter interviewed a dozen injured Wintek workers who said they had never been contacted by Apple or its intermediaries, and that Wintek had pressured them to resign and take cash settlements that would absolve the company of liability. After those interviews, Wintek pledged to provide more compensation to the injured workers and Apple sent a representative to speak with some of them.
Six months later, trade publications reported that Apple significantly cut prices paid to Wintek.
“You can set all the rules you want, but they’re meaningless if you don’t give suppliers enough profit to treat workers well,” said one former Apple executive with firsthand knowledge of the supplier responsibility group. “If you squeeze margins, you’re forcing them to cut safety.”
Wintek is still one of Apple’s most important suppliers. Wintek, in a statement, declined to comment except to say that after the episode, the company took “ample measures” to address the situation and “is committed to ensuring employee welfare and creating a safe and healthy work environment.”
Many major technology companies have worked with factories where conditions are troubling. However, independent monitors and suppliers say some act differently. Executives at multiple suppliers, in interviews, said that Hewlett-Packard and others allowed them slightly more profits and other allowances if they were used to improve worker conditions.
“Our suppliers are very open with us,” said Zoe McMahon, an executive in Hewlett-Packard’s supply chain social and environmental responsibility program. “They let us know when they are struggling to meet our expectations, and that influences our decisions.”
The Explosion
On the afternoon of the blast at the iPad plant, Lai Xiaodong telephoned his girlfriend, as he did every day. They had hoped to see each other that evening, but Mr. Lai’s manager said he had to work overtime, he told her.
He had been promoted quickly at Foxconn, and after just a few months was in charge of a team that maintained the machines that polished iPad cases. The sanding area was loud and hazy with aluminum dust. Workers wore masks and earplugs, but no matter how many times they showered, they were recognizable by the slight aluminum sparkle in their hair and at the corners of their eyes.
Just two weeks before the explosion, an advocacy group in Hong Kong published a report warning of unsafe conditions at the Chengdu plant, including problems with aluminum dust. The group, Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior, or Sacom, had videotaped workers covered with tiny aluminum particles. “Occupational health and safety issues in Chengdu are alarming,” the report read. “Workers also highlight the problem of poor ventilation and inadequate personal protective equipment.”
A copy of that report was sent to Apple. “There was no response,” said Debby Chan Sze Wan of the group. “A few months later I went to Cupertino, and went into the Apple lobby, but no one would meet with me. I’ve never heard from anyone from Apple at all.”
The morning of the explosion, Mr. Lai rode his bicycle to work. The iPad had gone on sale just weeks earlier, and workers were told thousands of cases needed to be polished each day. The factory was frantic, employees said. Rows of machines buffed cases as masked employees pushed buttons. Large air ducts hovered over each station, but they could not keep up with the three lines of machines polishing nonstop. Aluminum dust was everywhere.
Dust is a known safety hazard. In 2003, an aluminum dust explosion in Indiana destroyed a wheel factory and killed a worker. In 2008, agricultural dust inside a sugar factory in Georgiacaused an explosion that killed 14.
Two hours into Mr. Lai’s second shift, the building started to shake, as if an earthquake was under way. There was a series of blasts, plant workers said.
Then the screams began.
When Mr. Lai’s colleagues ran outside, dark smoke was mixing with a light rain, according to cellphone videos. The toll would eventually count four dead, 18 injured.

At the hospital, Mr. Lai’s girlfriend saw that his skin was almost completely burned away. “I recognized him from his legs, otherwise I wouldn’t know who that person was,” she said.
Eventually, his family arrived. Over 90 percent of his body had been seared. “My mom ran away from the room at the first sight of him. I cried. Nobody could stand it,” his brother said. When his mother eventually returned, she tried to avoid touching her son, for fear that it would cause pain.
“If I had known,” she said, “I would have grabbed his arm, I would have touched him.”
“He was very tough,” she said. “He held on for two days.”
After Mr. Lai died, Foxconn workers drove to Mr. Lai’s hometown and delivered a box of ashes. The company later wired a check for about $150,000.
Foxconn, in a statement, said that at the time of the explosion the Chengdu plant was in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, and “after ensuring that the families of the deceased employees were given the support they required, we ensured that all of the injured employees were given the highest quality medical care.” After the explosion, the company added, Foxconn immediately halted work in all polishing workshops, and later improved ventilation and dust disposal, and adopted technologies to enhance worker safety.
In its most recent supplier responsibility report, Apple wrote that after the explosion, the company contacted “the foremost experts in process safety” and assembled a team to investigate and make recommendations to prevent future accidents.
In December, however, seven months after the blast that killed Mr. Lai, another iPad factory exploded, this one in Shanghai. Once again, aluminum dust was the cause, according to interviews and Apple’s most recent supplier responsibility report. That blast injured 59 workers, with 23 hospitalized.
“It is gross negligence, after an explosion occurs, not to realize that every factory should be inspected,” said Nicholas Ashford, the occupational safety expert, who is now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “If it were terribly difficult to deal with aluminum dust, I would understand. But do you know how easy dust is to control? It’s called ventilation. We solved this problem over a century ago.”
In its most recent supplier responsibility report, Apple wrote that while the explosions both involved combustible aluminum dust, the causes were different. The company declined, however, to provide details. The report added that Apple had now audited all suppliers polishing aluminum products and had put stronger precautions in place. All suppliers have initiated required countermeasures, except one, which remains shut down, the report said.
For Mr. Lai’s family, questions remain. “We’re really not sure why he died,” said Mr. Lai’s mother, standing beside a shrine she built near their home. “We don’t understand what happened.”
Hitting the Apple Lottery
Every year, as rumors about Apple’s forthcoming products start to emerge, trade publications and Web sites begin speculating about which suppliers are likely to win the Apple lottery. Getting a contract from Apple can lift a company’s value by millions because of the implied endorsement of manufacturing quality. But few companies openly brag about the work: Apple generally requires suppliers to sign contracts promising they will not divulge anything, including the partnership.
That lack of transparency gives Apple an edge at keeping its plans secret. But it also has been a barrier to improving working conditions, according to advocates and former Apple executives.
This month, after numerous requests by advocacy and news organizations, including The New York Times, Apple released the names of 156 of its suppliers. In the report accompanying that list, Apple said they “account for more than 97 percent of what we pay to suppliers to manufacture our products.”
However, the company has not revealed the names of hundreds of other companies that do not directly contract with Apple, but supply the suppliers. The company’s supplier list does not disclose where factories are, and many are hard to find. And independent monitoring organizations say when they have tried to inspect Apple’s suppliers, they have been barred from entry — on Apple’s orders, they have been told.
“We’ve had this conversation hundreds of times,” said a former executive in Apple’s supplier responsibility group. “There is a genuine, companywide commitment to the code of conduct. But taking it to the next level and creating real change conflicts with secrecy and business goals, and so there’s only so far we can go.” Former Apple employees say they were generally prohibited from engaging with most outside groups.
“There’s a real culture of secrecy here that influences everything,” the former executive said.
Some other technology companies operate differently.
“We talk to a lot of outsiders,” said Gary Niekerk, director of corporate citizenship at Intel. “The world’s complex, and unless we’re dialoguing with outside groups, we miss a lot.”
Given Apple’s prominence and leadership in global manufacturing, if the company were to radically change its ways, it could overhaul how business is done. “Every company wants to be Apple,” said Sasha Lezhnev at the Enough Project, a group focused on corporate accountability. “If they committed to building a conflict-free iPhone, it would transform technology.”
But ultimately, say former Apple executives, there are few real outside pressures for change. Apple is one of the most admired brands. In a national survey conducted by The New York Times in November, 56 percent of respondents said they couldn’t think of anything negative about Apple. Fourteen percent said the worst thing about the company was that its products were too expensive. Just 2 percent mentioned overseas labor practices.
People like Ms. White of Harvard say that until consumers demand better conditions in overseas factories — as they did for companies like Nike and Gap, which today have overhauled conditions among suppliers — or regulators act, there is little impetus for radical change. Some Apple insiders agree.
“You can either manufacture in comfortable, worker-friendly factories, or you can reinvent the product every year, and make it better and faster and cheaper, which requires factories that seem harsh by American standards,” said a current Apple executive.
“And right now, customers care more about a new iPhone than working conditions in China.”"ÿÿApple’s iPad and the Human Costs for Workers in China

When Apple boss Steve Jobs unveiled his latest creation this week, the event was given quasi-religious significance. At a ceremony in San Francisco, more than 5,000 supplicants paid homage to a man hailed by some as a visionary.
Tickets to the event cost £1,000 - and guests watched in awe as Jobs, in his trademark black turtleneck jumper and blue jeans (he wears the same outfit seven days a week), held up the new Apple iPhone in front of a giant computer-generated image of himself.
With Apple now the biggest computing company on the planet, the 55-year-old could have been forgiven for looking smug. His latest iPhone, like the models before, is expected to generate billions in sales.
Steel wire meshes have been fitted to windows at Foxconn's factory to stop workers jumping after a rash of suicides believed to be due to harsh management practices
And with sales of his new iPad hitting one million in the U.S. within 28 days of its launch - one was sold every three seconds - Jobs has been credited with changing the way we live, introducing gadgets that keep us permanently connected.
They've also fuelled a massive sub-industry in phone applications or 'apps' which do everything from turning your phone into a virtual spirit level to timing pregnant women's contractions.
Given up for adoption as a baby, Jobs also likes to pose as a man of the California 'counter-culture' era, who made his fortune after taking LSD during a 'spiritual journey' in India, returning as a devout, shaven-headed Buddhist.
From those humble, supposedly spiritual beginnings, he is now a business behemoth, eclipsing Bill Gates at Microsoft as the most powerful man in computing. Apple's income currently approaches £10billion a year.
'I wish him [Bill Gates] the best, I really do,' Jobs once smirked. 'I just think he and Microsoft are a bit narrow. He'd be a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger.'
Yet, amid all the fanfare and celebrations this week, there was one sour, niggling note: reports of a spate of suicides at a secretive Chinese complex where Jobs's iPhone, iPod and iPad - Apple's new state-of-the-art slimline computer - are built and assembled.
With 11 workers taking their lives in sinister circumstances, Jobs acted swiftly to quell a potential public relations disaster.
Stressing that he found the deaths 'troubling' and that he was 'all over it', the billionaire brushed aside suggestions that the factory was a sweatshop.
'You go in this place and it's a factory but, my gosh, they've got restaurants and movie theatres and hospitals and swimming pools,' he said. 'For a factory, it's pretty nice.'
His definition of 'nice' is questionable and likely to have his American workers in uproar if such conditions were imposed upon them.
Foxconn employs 420,000 workers at its Shenzhen plant where conditions are very basic with no air-conditioning
For, as Apple's leader was taking a bow on the world stage, the Mail was under cover inside this Chinese complex. And we encountered a strange, disturbing world where new recruits are drilled along military lines, ordered to stand for the company song and kept in barracks like battery hens - all for little more than £20 a week.
In what's been dubbed the 'i-Nightmare factory', the scandal focuses on two sprawling complexes near Shenzhen, two decades ago a small fishing port and now a city of 17 million people.
This is the epicentre of operations for Foxconn, China's biggest exporter, which makes products under licence for Apple using a 420,000-strong workforce in Shenzhen. They have 800,000 workers country-wide.
And as Jobs was speaking in San Francisco, new measures were being secretly introduced at Foxconn to prevent the suicide scandal from worsening and damaging Apple sales globally.
Astonishingly, this involves forcing all Foxconn employees to sign a new legally binding document promising that they won't kill themselves.
The document, a copy of which has been obtained by the Mail, states that all employees (or their dependants) must promise not to sue the company as the result of 'any unexpected death or injury, including suicide or self torture'.
The owner of this massive, highly controlled iPad and iPhone factory has also decided to install something he's dubbed 'ai xin wang' - which translates literally as 'nets of a loving heart'
In reality, these 'loving hearts' are 10ft high wire fences on the roofs and 15ft wide nets at the base of all buildings. The human traps are to prevent people jumping to their deaths and smashing themselves on the pavements below.
Alongside such physical impediments to suicide, hundreds of monks have been flown in to the plant to exorcise evil spirits. Shaven-headed and wearing long robes, groups of monks have been seen chanting and praying amid baffled, exhausted workers.
More than 2,000 social workers are also being recruited and emergency helplines set up. Anyone appearing mentally ill or stressed is being identified by a special 'spotters' team set up to keep tabs on the workforce.
Workers who fail to respond to the chanting monks or the entreaties of social workers are secretly shipped to Shenzhen Mental Health Centre, a private facility where there are several wards crammed with Foxconn employees.
With the complex at peak production, operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week to meet the global demand for Apple phones and computers, a typical day begins with the Chinese national anthem being played over loudspeakers, with the words: 'Arise, arise, arise, millions of hearts with one mind.'
As part of this Orwellian control, the public address system constantly relays propaganda, such as how many products have been made. how a new basketball court has been built for the workers. and why workers should 'value efficiency every minute, every second'.
With other company slogans painted on workshop walls - including exhortations to 'achieve goals unless the sun no longer rises' and to 'gather all of the elite and Foxconn will get stronger and stronger' - the employees work up to 15-hour shifts.
Apple boss Steve Jobs brushed aside suggestions that the factory was a sweatshop
Down narrow, prison-like corridors, they sleep in cramped rooms in triple-decked bunk beds to save space, with simple bamboo mats for mattresses.
Despite summer temperatures hitting 35 degrees, with 90 per cent humidity, there is no air-conditioning. Workers say some dormitories house more than 40 people and are infested with ants and cockroaches, with the noise and stench making it difficult to sleep.
These workers answer to Terry Gou, an authoritarian figure whose contracts with Apple have helped make him, like his partner Jobs, one of the richest men in the world with a fortune estimated at £5.5billion.
While Jobs was away taking drugs in India, Gou - whose parents fled communist China to Taiwan - was starting Foxconn, employing ten workers to make television sets at his fledgling company.
But he quickly realised that there was a fortune to be made from China's booming population - a massive, cheap labour-force waiting to be exploited.
A workaholic, disciplinarian and perfectionist, Gou, 60, adopted a strict management style, inspired by his days in the private Taipei College of Maritime Technology followed by two years in the Taiwanese army.
Critics have dubbed iPhone maker Foxconn's complex an 'i-Nightmare factory'
New recruits at Foxconn are subjected to weeks of military-style drilling in order to build discipline. This is intended, as Gou puts it, to 'agglomerate them to act in unison and in concert' so that he can build a 'unique Foxconnian culture'.
As well as slogans on the walls, Gou orders staff to wear jackets bearing slogans such as: 'Together everyone achieves more.'
Strict discipline is enforced, with pay docked for any breaches under a bizarre points system. Points are deducted for crimes such as having long nails, being late, yawning, eating, sitting on the floor, talking or walking quickly.
During a week-long investigation, which involved dodging the security guards who constantly patrol the Foxconn complex and who beat up a Reuters photographer earlier this year, we spoke to dozens of workers on condition of anonymity.
On top of the living conditions, they all complained of intolerable pressure to hit targets for booming Apple sales, with managers exhorting what Gou calls his 'family' to work until they are ready to drop.
'There are just three points to your life when you work at Foxconn,' says Huang, 21, who finally quit last month because of the pressure. 'Going to work, coming-home from work and sleeping.' He added: 'You are totally isolated from the outside world. I walked the same path from dorm to factory and back to dorm. That was my world.
'There's no entertainment and no TV. There were 12 workers in my dorm, with some doing days, others nights and there was not a single person to talk to.'
Ma Xiangqian, 18, who killed himself earlier this year after just three months at Foxconn, was too scared to give up his job, despite the pressure, knowing poverty awaited as thousands compete for a single post.
He slowly cracked. First, he was 'fined' from his wages for breaking two tools by accident. After being exhorted to work harder, he was eventually taken off the production line and forced to wash toilets for several weeks as punishment.
He told his sister he was 'ashamed' of the way he was being treated. On January 23, he was found in a pool of blood at the foot of his dormitory block. His sister, who also worked at Foxconn, was told he had fainted and was recovering in hospital.
In reality, her brother was already in the morgue. She was then told that Ma was a victim of unexplained 'sudden death'.
After she took the highly unusual step of protesting and demanding a post mortem, Foxconn officials later changed the cause of death to 'falling from a great height'.
Like Jobs, Gou dismisses claims that working conditions at the complex are to blame, saying the spate of suicides were due to ' personal' reasons' such as broken relationships.
No smiles: Workers look on from a Foxconn logo near the gate of a Foxconn factory in the township of Longhua, Guangdong province
To the fury of his dead employees' relatives, Gou also claimed that some people had killed themselves for the money - saying they wanted Foxconn's 'generous compensation' for their families.
That is not the view of Yao Ruoqin, one of three known survivors of Apple suicide attempts. We found her at a Shenzhen hospital, although her name was not on official ward records.
'Terry Gou couldn't care less about me,' she said, recovering from broken hips and a damaged liver after jumping from the seventh floor at Foxconn.
Two other survivors we found at a local hospital - one called Tian Yu, 17, who has been paralysed from the waist down - refused to speak, saying Foxconn had threatened to stop paying their medical bills if they went public.
Appearing to confirm claims of overwork, another worker, Yan Li, 27, collapsed and died last week from exhaustion, according to SACOM, (Students & Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior), a Hong Kong pressure group that is monitoring the situation.
Yan collapsed having worked continuously for 34 hours. He was on the night shift for a month and had worked overtime every night, according to his wife.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, one line manager told us that there is constant pressure among all workers. 'We must meet the quota every day at the maximum quality,' said the man. 'There are several layers of management with the pressure coming from above.'
Qing Tong, 28, a former manager at Foxconn, has written a book detailing her experiences at the company, saying all traces of individual personality among workers must be erased to achieve Gou's mantra that 'time is money and efficiency is life'.
After details of the Chinese suicides leaked out, and Jobs promised he was 'all over it', his Chinese partner announced that his workers would receive a generous-sounding 30 per cent pay rise, raising the basic wage from £90 to £120 a month.
Yet human r ights groups denounced this as a public relations sham, saying that the legal minimum wage was being raised by the Chinese authorities in any case.
Lu Bing Dong, 22, helps produce 21,000 iPhones daily in his workshop alone. 'The pay rise is actually stopping us making more money because now they are strictly controlling overtime,' he says.
'Foxconn are very smart - they say it's a pay rise, but we actually earn less. It's meaningless. They will increase the daily quotas [of products made] to make up for lost time.'
As we left the sprawling Foxconn complex, workers were putting cages on one dormitory block with balconies - yet another measure to keep workers from killing themselves.
'It looks even more like a prison now,' said a weary Lu, 27, returning from a 15-hour shift.
One can't help wondering how Steve Jobs, the billionaire Buddhist, manages to square Foxconn's activities with his belief in karma - that what you do in this life will be repaid in the next..."ÿÿRevealed: Inside the Chinese suicide sweatshop where workers toil in 34-hour shifts to make your iPod

Foxconn Technology Group – the Taiwanese company that manufactures hardware for Apple, Dell, HP, Nokia and Sony and has been hit by a dozen suicides at its plants this year – is holding rallies at all of its factories to raise morale. The theme? ""Treasure Your Life, Love Your Family, Care for Each Other to Build a Wonderful Future."" The impact so far? Check out the picture above.
*'No matter how hard we try, such things will continue to happen'*At the rallies, which are slated to be held at all Foxconn factories, the company announced that it would raise the wages of its troubled workforce, more than doubling pay of its factory workers to $293 per month in the case of the company's Shenzhen compound where a rally was held yesterday, according to Reuters, where its employees had developed a pronounced habit of killing themselves – ostensibly due to the brutal working conditions and low pay.
In case the rallies, slogans and pay increases don't raise morale enough to stem the tide of suicides, Foxconn left suicide nets in place at its facilities that are designed to catch workers before they hit the ground, although it removed them from one facility (see update below).
""No matter how hard we try, such things will continue to happen,"" is how Louis Woo, assistant to the founder of Foxconn's parent company Hon Hai Precision Industry explained the situation at its factories, in a statement.
According to the company, ""success"" is the root of the morale problems it's trying to excise from its workforce.
""For a long period of time, I think we were kind of blinded by our success,"" Woo said. ""We were kind of caught by surprise.""
Due to the continued success of its manufacturing business – which helps the world's top electronics brands inexpensively produce high-end tech products which must typically be replaced every 2-3 years anyway – Foxconn plans to expand its workforce 40 percent, while reducing the number of workers in its Shenzhen industrial park from 470,000 to 300,000 or so over the next five years, perhaps to take pressure off of workers at that plant.
So far this year, 12 Foxconn employees have committed suicide, with the latest occurring on Aug. 4, when a 22-year-old female employee leapt to her death from her company-provided dormitory.
Apple, believed to be Foxconn's biggest customer, said conditions at Foxconn's Shenzhen plant were ""not a sweatshop"" and along with Dell and HP, investigated conditions at its manufacturer's factories, leading to an earlier pay raise. This latest raise precisely mirrors the recommendation of the China Labor Union Bulletin, which asked Foxconn to pay Shenzhen factory workers at least 2,000 yuan per month (the equivalent of $293), up from 900 yuan.
Regardless, China Labor Bulletin spokesman Geoffrey Crothall was not convinced that the raise and accompanying morale rallies will solve all of the problems of these workers, whose cheap wages and long hours are responsible for much of the electronics used by the rest of the world.
""I don't think today's event is going to achieve anything except provide a bit of theater,"" said Crothall in a statement. ""Basically, what Foxconn needs to do is treat its workers like decent human beings and pay them a decent wage. It's not rocket science.""
Update: AP Shenzhen reported on the Taipei Times today that these nets had been put in place, but they were installed earlier this year. After the rallies, Foxconn left them up at all of its factories except for its Taiyuan Campus location, said Woo in his phone statement, because more employees there have the support of their friends and family. The nets remain in place at the other facilities.

So, we thought it would be a great idea to put together a bunch of animal friendly options for friends and family. Gifts that they would not only appreciate and be able to use (as opposed to a dust collecting ornament) but are also in the spirit of Sustainable Jungle.  
…and the result is a collation of our top picks based on our approach to sustainable beauty.
In short, we’ve looked for gifts that are:



vegan
cruelty-free
organic / natural
palm oil free
have ethical ingredient sourcing policies and 
use thoughtful packaging (which is at the very least recyclable)



While we can’t always get every box ticked, this list prioritizes beauty gifts that are VEGAN and CRUELTY FREE.  We hope this is a helpful source of inspiration for all your gift shopping needs in the coming year ♥

YouTube has been subject to various controversies since its creation in 2005.
It has become one of Google's fastest-growing operations in terms of sales by simplifying the process of distributing video online but putting in place few limits on content.
However, parents, regulators, advertisers and law enforcement have become increasingly concerned about the open nature of the service.
They have contended that Google must do more to banish and restrict access to inappropriate videos, whether it be propaganda from religious extremists and Russia or comedy skits that appear to show children being forcibly drowned.
Child exploitation and inappropriate content
By the end of last year YouTube said it had removed more than 50 user channels and has stopped running ads on more than 3.5 million videos since June.
In March last year, a disturbing Peppa Pig fake, found by journalist Laura June, shows a dentist with a huge syringe pulling out the character's teeth as she screams in distress.
Mrs June only realised the violent nature of the video as her three-year-old daughter watched it beside her.
Hundreds of these disturbing videos were found on YouTube by BBC Trending back in March.
By the end of last year YouTube said it had removed more than 50 user channels and has stopped running ads on more than 3.5 million videos since June. One of the deleted videos was the wildly popular Toy Freaks YouTube channel featuring a single dad and his two daughters
All of these videos are easily accessed by children through YouTube's search results or recommended videos.
YouTube has been getting more stringent about deleting videos. One example is the wildly popular Toy Freaks YouTube channel featuring a single dad and his two daughters that was deleted last year.
Although it's unclear what exact policy the channel violated, the videos showed the girls in unusual situations that often involved gross-out food play and simulated vomiting.
The channel invented the 'bad baby' genre, and some videos showed the girls pretending to urinate on each other or fishing pacifiers out of the toilet.
Adverts being shown next to inappropriate videos
There has been widespread criticism that adverts are being shown on some clips depicting child exploitation.
YouTube has now tightened its rules on who qualifies for posting money-making ads.
Previously, channels with 10,000 total views qualified for the YouTube Partner Program which allows creators to collect some income from the adverts placed before their videos.
But YouTube's parent company Google has announced that from February 20, channels will need 1,000 subscribers and to have racked up 4,000 hours of watch time over the last 12 months regardless of total views, to qualify.
This is the biggest change to advertising rules on the site since its inception - and is another attempt to prevent the platform being 'co-opted by bad actors' after persistent complaints from advertisers over the past twelve months.
In November last year Lidl, Mars, Adidas, Cadbury maker Mondelez, Diageo and other big companies all pulled advertising from YouTube.
An investigation found the video sharing site was showing clips of scantily clad children alongside the ads of major brands.
One video of a pre-teenage girl in a nightie drew 6.5 million views.
Issues with system for flagging inappropriate videos
Another investigation in November found YouTube's system for reporting sexual comments had serious faults.
As a result, volunteer moderators have revealed there could be as many as 100,000 predatory accounts leaving inappropriate comments on videos.
Users use an online form to report accounts they find inappropriate.
Part of this process involves sending links to the specific videos or comments they are referring to.
Investigators identified 28 comments that obviously violated YouTube's guidelines.
According to the BBC, some include the phone numbers of adults, or requests for videos to satisfy sexual fetishes.
The children in the videos appeared to be younger than 13, the minimum age for registering an account on YouTube."ÿÿYet ANOTHER Google scandal as it's accused of profiting from extremism

Thousands of Google staff across the world have staged a series of walkouts in protest at claims of sexual harassment, gender inequality and systemic racism.
Demonstrations at the company’s offices around the world began at 11.10am in Tokyo and took place at the same time in other time zones.
They follow allegations of sexual misconduct made against senior executives, which organisers say are the most high-profile examples of “thousands” of similar cases across the company.
An image from the Singapore hub showed at least 100 staff protesting.

In London, the majority of employees left their desks and occupied the main auditorium in the company’s King’s Cross office. Once the room was filled, some gathered outside, as did a separate contingent of employees from the company’s AI subsidiary, DeepMind, prompting some confusion from those who did not recognise their corporate siblings.
“I’m here protesting against harassment in the workplace, to make sure we don’t protect or support those perpetrators of harassment,” one demonstrator told Sky News. “People are supporting those who have been harassed in any workplace situation, by any employer, and this is just part of the movement.”
Employees were urged to leave a flyer at their desk that read: “I’m not at my desk because I’m walking out in solidarity with other Googlers and contractors to protest [against] sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency and a workplace culture that’s not working for everyone.”
Google walkouts across the world
The Walkout for Real Change protest comes a week after it emerged that Google gave a $90m (£70m) severance package to Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile phone software, but concealed details of a sexual misconduct allegations that triggered his departure. Rubin has denied the allegations.
Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, insisted that the company had taken a “hard line” over sexual misconduct and would support employees who took part in the protests.
“Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward. We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action,” he said.
Campaigners have posted a list of five demands, including an end to pay and opportunity inequality as well as greater transparency about sexual harassment.
We, Google employees and contractors, will walkout on November 1 at 11:10am to demand these five real changes. #googlewalkout pic.twitter.com/amgTxK3IYw
The New York Times, which broke the Rubin story, also reported allegations of sexual misconduct against a number of other Google executives. These included Richard DeVaul, a director at the Google-affiliated lab that created far-flung projects such as self-driving cars and internet-beaming balloons.
DeVaul had remained at the X lab after allegations surfaced about him a few years ago. He resigned on Tuesday without a severance package.
Pichai apologised for the company’s “past actions” in an email sent to employees this week. “I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,” it said. “I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society and, yes, here at Google, too.”
The email did not mention the reported incidents involving Rubin, DeVaul or anyone else but Pichai did not dispute the veracity of the New York Times story.
Thursday’s protest will be a test of how effectively Pichai has managed to placate staff anger over the issue. Google and its parent company, Alphabet, employ 94,000 people worldwide.
An estimated 400 to 500 Googlers walked out of the New York office in Manhattan, gathering in a small park a few blocks away. Organisers said later that approximately 3,000 New York staff had taken part in the walkout. Some carrying signs with slogans such as “Workers rights are women’s rights” and “Time’s Up tech” – the latter a reference to the Time’s Up workers’ equality campaign stemming from last year’s reboot of the #MeToo movement in the US.

The mostly young workers listened to some of their co-workers address the crowd, such as Demma Rodriguez, who heads equity engineering at Google in New York.
“Enough is enough is enough!” she shouted, to cheers. “Every single person at Google is exceptional ... it is absolutely disgusting that anyone thinks you can be less than exceptional, worse than that, you can be negligent about sexual assault, sexual harassment and abuse of power.”
One man protesting, who declined to give his name, said he participated in the walkout because “I have a sister, a mother.”
He added: “I’m here for all the women in my life.”
Many were too nervous to talk to reporters, while some said they had been told by bosses not to or to refer the media to the company’s PR department.
But Amelia Brunner, 25, a software engineer, who has been with the company for three years, said that while she hasn’t experienced sexual harassment, she has endured different treatment at work because of her gender.
“People will doubt my work a lot more than they will doubt my male colleagues,” she said. “You will get talked down more in meetings.”
She said that while she has a “loud personality” that helps her overcome this, others may not.
“Theres a trickle-down effect “ she said. “How are you supposed to rise in the ranks?”
Mike Clancy, the general secretary of Prospect, the UK union for technology workers, backed the protest. He said: “The events at Google highlight the frustration many workers feel about their lack of voice in how many tech companies are run. We need a zero tolerance for harassment and greater transparency over terms and conditions for staff.”
Jackie Speier, a Silicon Valley congresswoman, tweeted her support of the walkout using the #MeToo hashtag, which has become a battle cry for women fighting sexual misconduct.

I stand w/hundreds of #Google engineers planning the women’s walkout in protest of the $90M exit package gifted to Andy Rubin after Google found allegations of his sexual misconduct to be credible. Why do they think it’s OK to reward perpetrators & further violate victims? #MeToo
October 30, 2018
Speier represents an affluent district where many Google employees live, the Associated Press reported.
In San Francisco, where approximately 2,500 employees work, hundreds gathered in front of the city’s Ferry Building.
Demonstrators booed as stories of bad executive behavior were told over the megaphone, and cries went up of: “We’re fed up, we can’t take it, equal pay, right now.”
One Latina employee said she was proud of how the event was able to mobilize a lot of workers in such a short time. Standing next to a white male colleague, the woman, who declined to give her name, said: “It wasn’t just women who came together. It was everyone coming together for the cause.”
Just before lunchtime on the west coast, the wave of global protests reached Google’s sprawling corporate headquarters in the San Francisco suburb of Mountain View.
Speakers in a central courtyard flanked by glass-walled office buildings were ringed by several hundred people who packed concrete walkways, waded into flower beds and stood atop benches or low walls.
Around a central folding table, participants wrote signs with slogans like “Time’s Up for tech”, “Happy to quit for $90 million” and “Hey Google, do better”.
The crowd, heavy on jeans and Google-branded apparel, alternately cheered and booed as organizers read stories submitted by female employees, many anonymously. They alleged widespread sexual harassment, a pervasive gender gap in pay and at least one suspected attempted assault.
Individual speakers recounted sexual comments from superiors, and months- or years-long ordeals with human resources officials who often urged silence.

Thousands of Google staff across the world have staged a series of walkouts in protest at claims of sexual harassment, gender inequality and systemic racism.
Demonstrations at the company’s offices around the world began at 11.10am in Tokyo and took place at the same time in other time zones.
They follow allegations of sexual misconduct made against senior executives, which organisers say are the most high-profile examples of “thousands” of similar cases across the company.
An image from the Singapore hub showed at least 100 staff protesting.

In London, the majority of employees left their desks and occupied the main auditorium in the company’s King’s Cross office. Once the room was filled, some gathered outside, as did a separate contingent of employees from the company’s AI subsidiary, DeepMind, prompting some confusion from those who did not recognise their corporate siblings.
“I’m here protesting against harassment in the workplace, to make sure we don’t protect or support those perpetrators of harassment,” one demonstrator told Sky News. “People are supporting those who have been harassed in any workplace situation, by any employer, and this is just part of the movement.”
Employees were urged to leave a flyer at their desk that read: “I’m not at my desk because I’m walking out in solidarity with other Googlers and contractors to protest [against] sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency and a workplace culture that’s not working for everyone.”
Google walkouts across the world
The Walkout for Real Change protest comes a week after it emerged that Google gave a $90m (£70m) severance package to Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile phone software, but concealed details of a sexual misconduct allegations that triggered his departure. Rubin has denied the allegations.
Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, insisted that the company had taken a “hard line” over sexual misconduct and would support employees who took part in the protests.
“Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward. We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action,” he said.
Campaigners have posted a list of five demands, including an end to pay and opportunity inequality as well as greater transparency about sexual harassment.
We, Google employees and contractors, will walkout on November 1 at 11:10am to demand these five real changes. #googlewalkout pic.twitter.com/amgTxK3IYw
The New York Times, which broke the Rubin story, also reported allegations of sexual misconduct against a number of other Google executives. These included Richard DeVaul, a director at the Google-affiliated lab that created far-flung projects such as self-driving cars and internet-beaming balloons.
DeVaul had remained at the X lab after allegations surfaced about him a few years ago. He resigned on Tuesday without a severance package.
Pichai apologised for the company’s “past actions” in an email sent to employees this week. “I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,” it said. “I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society and, yes, here at Google, too.”
The email did not mention the reported incidents involving Rubin, DeVaul or anyone else but Pichai did not dispute the veracity of the New York Times story.
Thursday’s protest will be a test of how effectively Pichai has managed to placate staff anger over the issue. Google and its parent company, Alphabet, employ 94,000 people worldwide.
An estimated 400 to 500 Googlers walked out of the New York office in Manhattan, gathering in a small park a few blocks away. Organisers said later that approximately 3,000 New York staff had taken part in the walkout. Some carrying signs with slogans such as “Workers rights are women’s rights” and “Time’s Up tech” – the latter a reference to the Time’s Up workers’ equality campaign stemming from last year’s reboot of the #MeToo movement in the US.

The mostly young workers listened to some of their co-workers address the crowd, such as Demma Rodriguez, who heads equity engineering at Google in New York.
“Enough is enough is enough!” she shouted, to cheers. “Every single person at Google is exceptional ... it is absolutely disgusting that anyone thinks you can be less than exceptional, worse than that, you can be negligent about sexual assault, sexual harassment and abuse of power.”
One man protesting, who declined to give his name, said he participated in the walkout because “I have a sister, a mother.”
He added: “I’m here for all the women in my life.”
Many were too nervous to talk to reporters, while some said they had been told by bosses not to or to refer the media to the company’s PR department.
But Amelia Brunner, 25, a software engineer, who has been with the company for three years, said that while she hasn’t experienced sexual harassment, she has endured different treatment at work because of her gender.
“People will doubt my work a lot more than they will doubt my male colleagues,” she said. “You will get talked down more in meetings.”
She said that while she has a “loud personality” that helps her overcome this, others may not.
“Theres a trickle-down effect “ she said. “How are you supposed to rise in the ranks?”
Mike Clancy, the general secretary of Prospect, the UK union for technology workers, backed the protest. He said: “The events at Google highlight the frustration many workers feel about their lack of voice in how many tech companies are run. We need a zero tolerance for harassment and greater transparency over terms and conditions for staff.”
Jackie Speier, a Silicon Valley congresswoman, tweeted her support of the walkout using the #MeToo hashtag, which has become a battle cry for women fighting sexual misconduct.

Speier represents an affluent district where many Google employees live, the Associated Press reported.
In San Francisco, where approximately 2,500 employees work, hundreds gathered in front of the city’s Ferry Building.
Demonstrators booed as stories of bad executive behavior were told over the megaphone, and cries went up of: “We’re fed up, we can’t take it, equal pay, right now.”
One Latina employee said she was proud of how the event was able to mobilize a lot of workers in such a short time. Standing next to a white male colleague, the woman, who declined to give her name, said: “It wasn’t just women who came together. It was everyone coming together for the cause.”
Just before lunchtime on the west coast, the wave of global protests reached Google’s sprawling corporate headquarters in the San Francisco suburb of Mountain View.
Speakers in a central courtyard flanked by glass-walled office buildings were ringed by several hundred people who packed concrete walkways, waded into flower beds and stood atop benches or low walls.
Around a central folding table, participants wrote signs with slogans like “Time’s Up for tech”, “Happy to quit for $90 million” and “Hey Google, do better”.
The crowd, heavy on jeans and Google-branded apparel, alternately cheered and booed as organizers read stories submitted by female employees, many anonymously. They alleged widespread sexual harassment, a pervasive gender gap in pay and at least one suspected attempted assault.
Individual speakers recounted sexual comments from superiors, and months- or years-long ordeals with human resources officials who often urged silence.
“I feel like I’m leading young girls and boys to the slaughter,” said one speaker, who identified herself as an employee who works on Android applications for children. “I mean, why would you want to go into tech if it’s like this?”"ÿÿGoogle walkout: global protests after sexual misconduct allegations

There is no market too small or large for Perkins. It’s part of the longtime entrepreneur’s approach to reaching customers wherever they may be.  Since May 1, the retail employee turned financial planner with Bank of America turned retail entrepreneur, has also run a pop-up store in MacArthur Center mall in downtown Norfolk, filling empty space left behind by Banana Republic, one of several mall retailers to leave this year along with Nordstrom.  But he does things the previous occupant, a traditional chain retailer, did not.

Among his customers are several Fortune 500 companies and other publicly-traded corporations who either give him their vinyl advertising materials (think billboards and banners) for him to use to make bags they’ll give as corporate gifts or that they’ll ultimately sell under their own brands. Zappos was one. T.J. Maxx, Dow Chemical and Nordstrom are others. Hewlett Packard commissioned him to make 3,000 bags for VIPs at the Coachella music festival in Southern California, which has become a must-attend event for influencers and style leaders.

(Stephen M. Katz)     Perkins said his 3-year-old company found its rhythm when he started working directly with corporations.  That relationship started naturally, he said. With his mission focused on recycling materials to make new products, he had to find the materials somewhere, and they came from the companies themselves. It evolved from there. Their corporate clients were offering their leftover materials and wanted his products, too.  “In a way, it was their idea,"" he said of the companies who appreciated his way of recycling their materials in a fun way.  “We still have a lot of work to do,” he said of that side of the business, as well as the potential to grow his footprint in retail stores.   Last year, his sales were heavily weighted to his corporate clients, 80 percent wholesale and 20 percent retail, he estimated. Now? It’s about a 50-50 split.  What he’s discovered is that customers still want to touch what they’re buying in person, especially when it comes to unique fabrics. Having the physical store, “amplifies the e-commerce experience,” he said.   Using material made from recycled plastic bottles (a canvas material), banana leaves (leather-like fabric) and used vinyl billboards for colorful accents, Perkins started selling his bags in 2016 after he raised nearly $26,000 from 150 people in a crowdfunding campaign. Now, he works with factories in New York, Los Angeles and China to produce them. He has one other full-time employee, and a part-time worker.

While the story goes that Perkins left the banking world for retailing when he couldn’t find the ideal carry-on for travel and designed his own, he’s been an entrepreneur for as long as he can remember. Whether it was selling candy, cutting grass or washing cars. He worked retail at local shops, including Legends and Cream. He even had a locker-decorating business in middle school. He went into banking after college thinking the corporate environment would lend itself to a quicker learning experience, but he kept being pulled to start his own business.  “I had always been entrepreneurial he said,” he said.

October 26, 2017 | 4:31pm | Updated October 26, 2017 | 5:44pm
German candymaker Haribo will launch an audit of its associated companies following allegations of using slave labor and sourcing its ingredients from producers with cruel animal conditions.
The company, mostly known for its gummy candy products sold worldwide, has come under fire after a documentary aired in Germany accusing the candymaker of using products made in unbearable conditions for animals and humans, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
According to the documentary, the company purchased carnauba wax from a Brazilian company that produced the ingredient under slave labor conditions, including no bathroom aces, no drinking water, and horrible living conditions for its workers. Workers at the company reportedly made $12 a day for harvesting palm leaves.
Workers were forced to labor for a month before being allowed to return home, prompting the Brazilian ministry of labor denounce the company and say the employees were treated “worse than animal” and the conditions “could be described as slavery,” according to German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.
As well as being accused of using companies that produced ingredients using slave labor, Haribo also reportedly sourced its gelatin from producers with cruel animal conditions, the Chronicle reported.
The documentary alleges that the candymaker outsourced gelatin production to a producer that used a farm where pigs had open wounds and pens covered in feces – or even dead pigs.
Haribo promised to launch an investigation into its practices following the documentary, telling Vice’s food site Munchies that “the conditions on the pig farms and the Brazilian plantations shown are insupportable.”
“Should it transpire that urgent improvements are needed in this area, we will insist on their implementation and will not rest until these improvements have been implemented,” a representative of Haribo told the outlet."ÿÿHaribo accused of using slave labor to make candy

08:42 CET+01:00
H&M has been criticized along with several other major clothing makers for how they treat workers in Cambodia, where hundreds of employees at a plant run by the Swedish fashion giant mysteriously passed out in August.
Next week, Cambodian factory workers plan to hold a “people's tribunal” presided over by an international panel of judges who will hear testimony about adverse working conditions and low pay.
While representatives from multinational clothing brands Puma and Adidas plan to attend the hearing, H&M said it won't attend, choosing instead to supply information about what it was doing to address worker concerns, the Guardian newspaper reported.
Jeroen Merk with the Clean Clothes Campaign advocacy group told the newspaper it was ""disappointing"" that H&M, as well as Gap, wouldn't attend the panel.
The hearing is being organized by the Asian Floor Wage Alliance advocacy group, which argues that conditions in Cambodian clothing factories violate basic human rights and that the minimum wage of $61 per month is too low.
While refusing to send a representative to the hearing, H&M said it welcomes initiatives that highlight issues related to workers' rights.
“We work actively to strengthen the rights of textile workers,” H&M's head of sustainability, Helena Helmersson, told the TT news agency.
“Our code of conduct requires that we pay at least the legal minimum wage. But the same factories that H&M purchases products from also sew for other large chains. There are often misunderstandings about how much control we have over wages.”
Helmersson pointed out that it's hard for clothing companies to determine what an appropriate minimum wage ought to be in a given country and that H&M participates in the Fair Wage Network, which tracks wages paid in the textile industry.
At the hearing, hundreds of workers are expected to testify about a series of mass faintings that occurred in August at factories that supply clothes to H&M and other global brands.
According to Helmersson, the Swedish clothing retailer has hired consultants to examine what may have caused the incident, in which hundreds of workers suddenly lost consciousness.
She said that one explanation may be that the workers lacked ways to air their complaints or that they were working too much overtime.
“Overtime is a general problem in the industry. It's a challenge both for us and for other buyers in these countries,” Helmersson told TT.
The Cambodian textile industry employs around 300,000 workers and grew by 28 percent last year. Most of the factories are owned by Chinese or Taiwanese companies.
The workers are mainly low paid women and the unsatisfactory working conditions have led to a slew of strikes and protests in the last few years."ÿÿH&M under fire over Cambodia mass faintings

Children as young as 14 have been employed to make clothes for some of the most popular names on the UK high street, according to a new report.
New Look, Sports Direct’s Lonsdale brand and H&M have all used factories found to have employed children, after several major brands switched their production to low-cost factories in Myanmar. Workers told investigators that they were paid as little as 13p an hour producing clothes for UK retailers – half the full legal minimum wage.
Labour rights campaigners say that the use of children in factories supplying household names is the result of a “race to the bottom”, as brands chase ever lower labour costs.
The Netherlands-based Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (known by its Dutch initials as Somo) interviewed 400 workers in 12 factories supplying international brands and worked with the Observer to finalise the report.
“We thought that brands were getting the message on child labour but this investigation shows the risks involved in constantly trying to cut labour costs,” said researcher Pauline Overeem. “The widespread use of children in Myanmar to manufacture clothes for western brands is alarming and depressing and we urge all companies to take responsibility and to ensure that children are getting the education they need and deserve.”
Brands have had some success eliminating child labour from their main supplier factories in recent years, but as wages have risen in countries such as China, companies are increasingly moving production to cheaper markets, including Myanmar, where children can legally be employed for up to four hours a day from the age of 14.
The legal minimum wage in Myanmar is 3,600 kyat (£2.12) for an eight-hour day – equivalent to 26p an hour. Workers in all the factories investigated worked six-day weeks. Labour NGOs argued when the minimum wage was set that a minimum of 6,000 kyat a day was required for a basic standard of living.
All the factories investigated employed workers below the age of 18. Several workers at factories supplying Lonsdale and New Look stated in detailed interviews that they had started work at the age of 14.
A German brand that sourced from the same factory as New Look reported that it had found “misconducts” at the factory, including evidence of child employment. Researchers said the factory subsequently dismissed all workers below the age of 18. But one of the workers, asked her age by the researchers, replied: “Do you want to know my real age or my age at the factory?” A worker at another factory told researchers: “When buyers come into the factory the child workers are being told not to come to work that day.”
There were also reports of several workers below the age of 15 at a factory supplying H&M and Muji. H&M confirmed that it had found two 14-year-olds but that an inspection in November found no one under 14.
Researchers found wages below the full legal minimum at factories supplying Sports Direct, Henri Lloyd, New Look, H&M, Muji, Pierre Cardin and Karrimor (owned by Sports Direct).
The lowest wages of just 13p an hour were found in factories supplying H&M, Karrimor, Muji and Pierre Cardin. The day rate for those workers was £1.06. Myanmar’s labour laws permit factories to pay newer workers at reduced rates.
Workers say they struggle to live on such low wages. Thiri and Yadana, who both worked at a factory supplying Lonsdale, said they could only afford to live in a makeshift hut in a squatter area without electricity or running water.
Thiri said: “The upside of living here is that we don’t need to spend money on rent which makes it easier to get by.”
According to Myanmar’s factories act, workers should not be expected to do more than 60 hours a week, including overtime, but workers reported longer hours in factories supplying New Look, Sports Direct, Henri Lloyd, Karrimor and H&M. Forced overtime was reported by workers in factories supplying H&M, Muji, Sports Direct and Henri Lloyd, while there were reports of unpaid overtime at factories supplying New Look, Pierre Cardin and H&M.
Factory owners in Myanmar say they are under intense pressure from brands to cut costs. Daw Khine Khine Nwe, secretary of the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association, urged UK shoppers to think about how budget clothes are produced. “We are asking the buyer to increase the rate and we’ll share it with the worker. But they’re not willing.”
In an interview with the Observer in Yangon last year, she said: “The consumer also needs to understand – the consumer asks for better quality but when it comes to the price they always look for the cheapest one. Which do you want?”
The low labour costs in Myanmar have encouraged international brands to switch production from more expensive countries and between 2010 and 2014 exports tripled to £787m. There are now more than 400 factories in the country, employing 350,000 people, 90% of them women.
In its report, Somo urges the companies to pay workers a living wage: “Clothing companies are constantly on the lookout for production locations that can make clothes quickly and at low costs,” it says. “Over the past few years, Myanmar has rapidly become a popular sourcing destination for the garment industry due to a huge pool of cheap labour and favourable import and export tariffs.
However, working conditions in this industry are far from acceptable. Labour rights violations are rife. Asian suppliers are setting up shop in Myanmar in an unseemly ‘race to the bottom’, pushed by foreign buyers that are eager to secure the cheapest possible prices.”
New Look said: “We recognise the issues highlighted in this report. We are working with our suppliers and local partners in Myanmar to address the findings and to support the development of an ethical garment industry in the area.”
H&M said the report raised “industry-wide challenges”. “It is of utmost importance to us that all our products are made under good working conditions and with consideration to environment, health and safety. We want people to be treated with respect and that our suppliers offer all their workers good, fair and safe working conditions.”
The company stressed that child labour was totally unacceptable, but pointed out that the legal age for working in Myanmar was 14.
Sports Direct dismissed the interviews with the workers as “anecdotal and uncorroborated”, with a spokesman adding: “We would therefore strongly advise you not to publish.” But in a statement the company said: “However, we do not condone these types of abuse and we have policies in place which reflect this view. Details of these policies are published on our company website in our statement about the Modern Slavery Act.”
A spokeswoman for Muji said: “We are committed on a global scale to always ensure good working practices, both internally and in cooperation with our external partners.”
Pierre Cardin said it would investigate the matter further and take the appropriate measures.
Henri Lloyd did not respond to repeated requests for comment and did not respond when offered an opportunity by Somo to react to the report."ÿÿHow high street clothes were made by children in Myanmar for 13p an hour

Company to Pay $108 Million to Settle Civil and Criminal Cases
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Hewlett-Packard with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries in three different countries made improper payments to government officials to obtain or retain lucrative public contracts.
Hewlett-Packard has agreed to pay more than $108 million to settle the SEC’s charges and a parallel criminal case announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.
The SEC’s order instituting settled administrative proceedings finds that the Palo Alto, Calif.-based technology company’s subsidiary in Russia paid more than $2 million through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multi-million dollar contract with the federal prosecutor’s office. In Poland, Hewlett-Packard’s subsidiary provided gifts and cash bribes worth more than $600,000 to a Polish government official to obtain contracts with the national police agency. And as part of its bid to win a software sale to Mexico’s state-owned petroleum company, Hewlett-Packard’s subsidiary in Mexico paid more than $1 million in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, and money was funneled to one of those officials.
“Hewlett-Packard lacked the internal controls to stop a pattern of illegal payments to win business in Mexico and Eastern Europe. The company’s books and records reflected the payments as legitimate commissions and expenses,” said Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit. “Companies have a fundamental obligation to ensure that their internal controls are both reasonably designed and appropriately implemented across their entire business operations, and they should take a hard look at the agents conducting business on their behalf.”
According to the SEC’s order, the scheme involving Hewlett-Packard’s Russian subsidiary occurred from approximately 2000 to 2007. The bribes were paid through agents and consultants in order to win a government contract for computer hardware and software. Employees within the subsidiary and elsewhere raised questions about the significant markup being paid to the agent on the deal and the subcontractors that the agent expected to use. Despite the red flags, the deal went forward without any meaningful due diligence on the agent or the subcontractors.
The SEC’s order finds that bribes involving Hewlett-Packard’s subsidiary in Poland occurred from approximately 2006 to 2010. Acting primarily through its public sector sales manager, the subsidiary agreed to pay a Polish government official in order to win contracts for information technology products and services. The official received a percentage of net revenue earned from the contracts, and the bribes were delivered in cash from off-the-books accounts.
According to the SEC’s order, Hewlett-Packard’s subsidiary in Mexico paid a consultant to help the company win a public IT contract worth approximately $6 million. At least $125,000 was funneled to a government official at the state-owned petroleum company with whom the consultant had connections. Although the consultant was not an approved deal partner and had not been subjected to the due diligence required under company policy, HP Mexico sales managers used a pass-through entity to pay inflated commissions to the consultant. This was internally referred to as the “influencer fee.”
Hewlett-Packard consented to the SEC’s order, which finds that it violated the internal controls and books and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company agreed to pay $29 million in disgorgement (approximately $26.47 million to the SEC and $2.53 million to satisfy an IRS forfeiture as part of the criminal matter). Hewlett-Packard also agreed to pay prejudgment interest of $5 million to the SEC and fines totaling $74.2 million in the criminal case for a total of more than $108 million in disgorgement and penalties.
The SEC’s investigation was conducted by David A. Berman and Tracy L. Davis of the FCPA Unit in San Francisco. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and Public Prosecutor’s Office in Dresden, Germany."ÿÿSEC.gov | SEC Charges Hewlett-Packard With FCPA Violations

In her Pulitzer Prize–winning A Problem from Hell (2002), the journalist and lawyer Samantha Power argued that the United States should use its overwhelming power to prevent or halt crimes against humanity. Power was responding to the United States’ failure to thwart genocide in Rwanda, Bosnia, and Kosovo, and her arguments quickly permeated the Democratic Party’s foreign-policy establishment. After all, many reasoned, if the United States was truly the world’s “indispensable nation,” shouldn’t it work for the good of all?
When Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, Power’s arguments helped undergird the liberal internationalism of his administration (in which Power served). Though Obama campaigned on an anti-militarist foreign policy, his administration intervened in Libya to prevent a massacre in Benghazi—which helped engender the chaos the country finds itself in today—and helped militarize the Syrian conflict, in part with humanitarian goals in mind. By the end of Obama’s time in office, humanitarian intervention had become a core tool in the kit of liberal foreign policy.
The unexpected election of Donald Trump, however, has forced intellectuals across the political spectrum to rethink some of their fundamental assumptions. During his campaign, Trump rejected American exceptionalism, the idea that the United States is uniquely able to redeem the world. His victory suggested that many agreed with him and had grown tired of the endless wars cheered on by the foreign-policy establishment.
A group of anti-imperialist intellectuals, in particular, have responded to Trump’s election by crafting an avowedly left-wing foreign policy that doubts the efficacy and morality of humanitarian intervention. To these individuals, recent history demonstrates that military intervention creates more problems than it solves—see Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria—and encourages the United States to assume responsibility for conflicts it has neither the will, capacity, nor knowledge to resolve. Intervention, critics also claim, strengthens an already-too-powerful military and contributes to the imperialism supporting the global network of bases that the United States has constructed since World War II.
Yet anti-imperialists have failed to satisfactorily confront the problems of genocide and ethnic cleansing. This is a significant lacuna, especially given that a genuinely left-wing candidate could win the presidency in 2020 and thus be able to manipulate the levers of state power. What should a president sympathetic to the left-wing critique of humanitarian intervention do in the face of crimes against humanity?
By exploring China’s horrendous treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority, we can examine this issue. China provides an important test case for left-wing foreign policy because it raises the question of whether the anti-imperialist left can alleviate suffering while eschewing military intervention.
Even for a ruling party that has long succumbed to its dystopian urges, the situation in the vast northwest Chinese region of Xinjiang is grim. Roughly a million Muslims—mostly Uighurs, a Turkic minority—languish in concentration camps, detained for crimes like insufficient patriotism or refusing to eat pork. Beijing has also sent approximately 1 million non-Muslim Chinese to live with and monitor Uighur families. These agents record instances of fasting and of “extreme” beards or dresses that are suspiciously long. The government also forces many of the region’s roughly 10 million Uighurs to download apps that monitor all of their communications.
Regardless of whether one believes military intervention is a legitimate tool, China in 2019 is too vast, powerful, wealthy, and economically integrated with the United States to be a reasonable military target. So what should the United States do to respond to the Uighur crisis?
The most effective resistance to the treatment of Uighurs is increasing the public-relations costs for Beijing. The State Department should publicize this issue in other Muslim countries, particularly influential American allies like Saudi Arabia, and among China’s neighbors, especially Pakistan and Kazakhstan, with the hopes of increasing international pressure to end the ethnic cleansing. To help coordinate this work across the Muslim world, it should create a special envoy for Xinjiang akin to the envoys who travel the globe attempting to coordinate diplomatic responses to the crises in Yemen and Ukraine.
A left-wing government could also work to popularize the fact of Uighur oppression among ordinary Americans, many of whom will recoil at the savage treatment. Progressive members of Congress should further introduce bills that bring attention to the Uighur cause so that it is not only conservatives like Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) who are volubly addressing this crime against humanity. The anti-imperialist left, in short, must no longer cede the ground of humanitarianism to centrist Democrats or the GOP but must advocate its own progressive approach to the problem.
US media outlets have covered Xinjiang, but partly because of the lack of compelling images, it has been mostly a print, not television or YouTube, story. To help bring attention to China’s abuse of Uighurs, the left should encourage the State Department to declassify and circulate images of the concentration camps. This will help solidify global opposition to the ethnic cleansing, much as CBS’s 2004 publication of images of American atrocities at the Abu Ghraib prison helped fuel global opposition to the war in Iraq.
Whatever images American organizations manage to secure, the left should lobby government officials and NGO workers to hold public briefings that feature these images as well as testimony from survivors of the camps. Increasing the public relations—and hence, the economic, social, and political—costs for Beijing will hopefully pressure the Chinese Communist Party to scale back its oppressive behavior. In fact, this should be a general left-wing principle: When confronted with genocide and ethnic cleansing abroad, public and diplomatic pressure should be the central instruments the government uses to defend the liberties and rights of foreign peoples.
There is another way the American state could ameliorate the persecution of Uighurs: funding resettlement programs. Many Uighurs no doubt prefer emigration to persecution. A left-wing government should therefore create an office of resettlement to fund Uighur immigration (the United States, of course, must also reform its immigration laws and end the mass imprisonment of asylum seekers). Another option would be to fund and coordinate resettlement programs in the other nations already hosting thousands of Uighurs—such as Germany, Turkey, and Kazakhstan—which would provide immediate relief as the left works to transform the anti-immigrant ideology that informs the worldviews of too many Americans.
Regulation would also be a useful means to sanction the Chinese companies, especially tech and surveillance companies, whose products assist Beijing in repressing Uighurs. The United States has considered sanctioning the Chinese surveillance giant Hikvision, which has provided thousands of cameras that monitor mosques, schools, and concentration camps in Xinjiang. Actually doing so would have the benefit of warning the American companies that have worked with Hikvision—including the public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller, the lobbying firm Sidley Austin, and Amazon—that a left-wing government will not allow American companies to facilitate gross human-rights abuses.
Moreover, civil-society organizations like NGOs and labor unions must take a more activist approach to foreign affairs. When it comes to China, American organizations have long traded access for integrity. For instance, the American Bar Association (ABA), which claims to “hold governments accountable under law,” has barely criticized Beijing’s crackdown on human-rights lawyers, in part because it feared jeopardizing the legal-training programs it runs there. And some American universities even restrict discussions of Chinese human-rights abuses for fear of losing access to the country. Columbia University, for instance, canceled several talks on topics sensitive to the Communist Party because it was worried about offending Beijing.
Civil-society organizations must depart from this trend. The left needs to pressure groups like the ABA to publicly criticize China while simultaneously compelling universities to embrace their commitment to free inquiry, even if this means restricted access to Chinese capital, Chinese students, or Chinese visas. Moreover, the left should encourage civil-society groups to use their connections to politicians to push for programs to resettle Uighurs—and dissent-minded Chinese—who desire to move to the United States. And it goes without saying that this must be done with the active participation—and indeed, leadership—of Uighurs themselves, who understand the needs and interests of their community better than any outsider.
Taken together, we believe that these actions could put pressure on the Chinese Communist Party while avoiding a Manichean struggle reminiscent of the Cold War. Though we appreciate that diplomatic and moral pressure will not be enough to curtail ethnic cleansing within China’s own borders, that doesn’t mean the anti-imperialist left shouldn’t take steps to publicize and mitigate China’s crimes."ÿÿHow the Left Should Respond to Ethnic Cleansing in China

An illuminated Huawei Technologies Co. logo is displayed above their stand on the opening day of the... [+] MWC Barcelona in Barcelona, Spain, on Monday, Feb. 25, 2019. At the wireless industry’s biggest conference, over 100,000 people are set to see the latest innovations in smartphones, artificial intelligence devices and autonomous drones exhibited by more than 2,400 companies.

Cyber-espionage has been going on for years. In one famous example in 2012, it emerged that China had hacked UK defense firm BAE Systems to steal data about a $264 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) jet. And it wasn’t the first time the country had been accused of stealing military jet plans.
But recently, the focus has moved to Chinese companies, particularly those that manufacture network equipment as 5G services start to roll out. So, why is all the focus on Huawei, and how secure is it to use its products and services?
Founded in Shenzhen, Guangdong, in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former People's Liberation Army officer, the firm is owned by 80,000 of its 180,000 employees. Like its rivals Nokia and Ericsson, Huawei has manufactured mobile network equipment for years.
During the last decade or so it has stormed into the consumer market as a smartphone manufacturer and now owns 16% of the market. At Mobile World Congress (MWC) this week, it became the latest to announce a folding smartphone with the launch of the Mate X.
The story so far
There is growing concern about Huawei from governments around the world. So much so, that many have blocked telecoms companies from using Huawei gear in next-generation 5G mobile networks.
So far, the US and Australia have banned Huawei from providing equipment for their 5G networks, while Canada’s relationship with the firm is under review. There is also concern among European telecoms network operators, with some considering removing Huawei’s equipment. BT, for example, has removed Huawei equipment from key parts of its 4G network.
At the same time, the UK has expressed concerns, with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) asking Huawei to fix issues that could pose a new risk to the network.
The US is particularly concerned about Ren’s military background. And the State Department's top cyber official, Robert Strayer, certainly thinks there is an issue.
""A country that uses data in the way China has - to surveil its citizens, to set up credit scores and to imprison more than 1 million people for their ethnic and religious background - should give us pause about the way that country might use data in the future,"" Strayer said, according to The Washington Post. ""It would be naive to think that country, [given] the influence it has over its companies, would act in ways that would treat our citizens better than it treats its own citizens.""
Meanwhile, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, Meng Wanzhou was last year arrested by Canadian authorities, after the US government alleged that she was assisting Huawei in dodging US sanctions on Iran. She and the firm deny any wrongdoing.
Are Huawei phones safe?
Last year, Huawei phones were banned by networks including Verizon and AT&T after being labelled a security threat. Meanwhile, tech site Tech.Co interviewed Timothy Heath, senior international defense research analyst at the RAND Corporation, who believes it is entirely plausible that the firm’s phones could be used to spy:
“The threat is legitimate, given the murky links between Huawei and Chinese authorities. The Chinese state has the authority to demand tech companies like Huawei turn over useful information or provide access to the communications and technologies owned and sold by Huawei.
""Chinese authorities can use this information and access to facilitate espionage or cyber attacks over Huawei communications technologies. Consumer tech devices like phones that rely on Huawei technologies will be easier for Chinese authorities to penetrate and exploit for these reasons.”
He added: “Tech companies play a critical role in developing the dual use technologies that the PLA needs to fight a hi-tech war against world class militaries like that of the United States.”
What about Huawei network equipment?
As an equipment vendor, it is technically possible for Huawei to conduct espionage through the network, or even for it to disrupt communications with disastrous consequences. As more devices are connected to the internet, including autonomous vehicles and electrical grids, this threat becomes all the more real.
The risk becomes bigger with 5G because the way the networks are designed and run makes it harder to monitor security, according to the head of the UK's intelligence service MI6, Alex Younger.
However, many of the UK providers including EE, Vodafone and Three have been working with Huawei to build their 5G networks. They are currently waiting for the UK government to decide whether they will be permitted to carry on doing so, with a decision coming in Spring this year.
China's National Intelligence Law passed in 2017 says organizations should ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work"".
But a Huawei spokesperson says: “We are a private company owned by employees and comply with applicable laws and regulations. If we are forced to maliciously violate the trust of our customers, we would rather shut the company down. We are committed to developing the most innovative and secure technology, to bring digital to every person, home and organization for a fully connected, intelligent world. We will make all sacrifices – at any cost – to defend security without hurting any country, any organization, or any individual. This is our highest agenda.”
What does Huawei say?
It’s Mobile World Congress this week so what better place for Huawei to hit back at recent comments from the US? During his keynote Huawei chairman Guo Ping denied that the firm spies on behalf of its country’s government. It has ""no evidence, nothing"", he said, adding that the vendor had never planted backdoors in its equipment and would not permit third parties to meddle with its kit. Guo said, according to Business Insider: ""Carriers are responsible for the secure operations of their own networks. Carriers can prevent outside attacks.""
He also hit out at the US government for its new law allowing it to demand data stored with Amazon, Microsoft, or other cloud providers.
What should you do?
First, don’t panic. Ian Thornton Trump, head of cyber security at AMTrust international, points out: “If nation states are going to hack, they are going to hack. This has very little to do with security. this has everything to do with market protectionism and vendettas against companies that don’t bend to the will of the US.”
He therefore thinks security is a side show “being used as leverage and FUD to promote someone else’s products and services”. He says: “There has been no public mention of a security issue with Huawei and you can bet an indictment that if it did have a back door this would be blasted to the media.
“The indictment of Huawei is about intellectual property theft – allegedly and perhaps not even an American company – and selling to Iran using front companies. How a Chinese company is subject to American law is of course the big and larger question.”
Huawei is certainly producing some innovative phones and it’s been working on network equipment for years. Of course, intelligence personnel will know a lot more about what’s happening behind the scenes, so it’s important to be wary. But at the same time, much of this is about political posturing: Do we really think Huawei has manufactured a folding phone so it can tap all our calls and take over the network? Probably not."ÿÿHuawei Security Scandal: Everything You Need to Know

Dr. Debra Teachout, DVM, MVSc ""Force-feeding in the foie gras industry is inherently cruel. ...

 Published October 30, 2019 by .  Today, one of the biggest cities in the world has taken a firm stand against cruelty to animals. In a packed room, surrounded by PETA supporters, the New York City Council voted to pass multiple new PETA-backed laws to help animals. The council has banned foie gras, making it illegal to sell or serve the barbaric dish. It further regulated the horse-drawn carriage industry, protecting horses from being forced to work in extreme temperatures. The council also passed an important measure to protect wild birds from poaching, and it passed a resolution supporting a statewide ban on the sale of dogs, cats, and rabbits in pet stores, which would give shelters a leg up and help to stem the homeless-animal crisis. Finally, New York voted to help dogs even more by increasing the mandatory fines for abusing them by keeping them chained.© iStock.com/George_ClerkAs the foie gras ban and horse-drawn carriage regulations faced the stiffest industry opposition, we focused our efforts on making sure those measures passed.“Foie gras” means “fatty liver” in French, and this “delicacy” is actually the diseased livers of ducks and geese who have been force-fed through a large metal rod shoved down their throats multiple times a day until their livers swell to up to 10 times their normal size. A coalition of more than 50 organizations, including PETA, led and organized by Voters for Animal Rights, helped keep this lifesaving bill on track. We held spirited demonstrations, provided expert eyewitness testimony to the city council, and showed the gut-wrenching footage from our investigations into foie gras farms, including Hudson Valley Foie Gras in Ferndale, New York.Despite pushback by the foie gras industry, we won.“Force-feeding a bird for the sole purpose of making it sick to create some bizarre delicacy is gruesome and inhumane.” —New York City Council Member Justin Brannan“I can think of nothing more commonsense than ending the egregious practice of selling a luxury food item made from abused animals.”—New York City Council Member Carlina RiveraFoie gras production has now been banned by 15 countries, and dozens of restaurants and retailers—including Aramark, Costco, FreshDirect, Postmates, Target, and Whole Foods—don’t carry the food as a matter of policy. Many of them made this decision after hearing from PETA and our members. With our help and with assistance from our friends at other organizations, California became the first state to ban it, and now, New York City has followed suit. We won’t stop until no duck or goose ever suffers for foie gras again.The important new law that will help protect horses forced to pull heavy carts full of tourists all day, every day, was introduced by PETA’s friends New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets (NYCLASS). It requires horse-drawn carriage operators to abide by the heat index and suspend operations when the weather becomes too extreme to make the horses work. This vital legislation follows years of efforts by NYCLASS, PETA, and our supporters—including initiating a massive public information campaign, working with city officials and lawmakers on legislation, providing expert testimony on what horses made to pull carriages endure, sending in mounds of petitions, and holding countless demonstrations.Horses don't belong on crowded streets! Moving horse carriages out of #NYC's Midtown traffic & into #CentralPark is an encouraging first step. https://t.co/tkJ6bCXauQ— PETA (@peta) August 30, 2018Animal advocates scored a previous major victory for these horses in January, when a Supreme Court justice upheld Mayor Bill de Blasio’s restriction that moved the horses off congested, dangerous city streets and limited their use to Central Park following several traffic accidents involving the carriages. Horse exploiters sued de Blasio in order to try to keep the animals trudging between blasting car horns and exhaust fumes. So when hundreds of activists stormed the streets of New York City for the annual Official Animal Rights March, the demonstration included loud chants to get the horses out of city traffic.PETA and NYLCASS won’t stop until these abusive tourist amusements have ended and the horses have been retired.Thank you to the PETA supporters in New York and across the country who helped make these exciting victories for animals possible.

PETA uncovered documents about tests revealing that experimenters force-fed mice vitamin D, suffocated them, and broke their necks. Afterward, experimenters drained their blood for analysis.Other tests included force-feeding rats feces and even genetically modifying them. Experimenters fed them corn starch with or without antibiotics and injected them with a chemical that induces colorectal cancer. They also starved rats, injected them with glucose and insulin, cut open veins in their tails, and repeatedly bled them.

Former Canada Goose Supplier Proves There's No Such Thing as Ethical DownTake ActionPETA’s 2017 eyewitness exposé of James Valley Colony Farms (JVC), a former Canada Goose down supplier, revealed that workers rounded up panicked geese, grabbing and carrying them by the neck as they struggled with their entire weight hanging down, and crammed them into densely packed cages for transport to slaughter. There is nothing ethical about the treatment of these geese.Although Canada Goose insists that it was no longer using this farm to source its feathers at the time of PETA’s investigation, the company showcased JVC’s claims of “tender loving care” of geese in a video on its own “down traceability” webpage as well as on YouTube and didn’t remove footage of JVC from its promotional materials until 2019. Regardless of which feathers came from where, there’s absolutely no such thing as ethical down, despite Canada Goose’s claims—birds used by the industry are all slaughtered in violent ways. The company tells customers that it’s “deeply committed” to the “ethical sourcing of all animal materials”—but this is misleading, because all down comes from sensitive birds who didn’t want to be killed.See for yourself what really happens to birds used for their down, and help stop this cruelty.Crushed and ShriekingGeese were herded into small wire pens, where they visibly panicked and trampled each other. Those on the bottom of the pile were crushed. At least one died, and a worker tossed the dead bird over the fence.These distressed geese are climbing on top of each other in panic and fear, and some even suffocate. Grabbed and Carried by the NeckAfter the geese were confined to the pens, workers hauled them to transport crates by their necks as they shrieked and flapped their wings in distress. One worker repeatedly stepped on some geese while reaching for others. Then they were crammed into the crates with such force that the cages clanged.Confined to Cramped Cages for Up to 24 HoursA veterinarian who viewed the footage said, “Being confined to these small crates for prolonged periods would cause painful muscle cramping, unnecessary stress, and predispose anxious birds to injury.” The trip to the slaughterhouse—Schiltz Foods in South Dakota—lasted over five hours, and some geese were left in the feces-covered crates for up to 24 hours without food or water.Watching in Terror As Others Are Shackled and KilledOnce they’d been unloaded for slaughter, the geese watched, terrified, as other frightened birds were again grabbed by the neck, stunned, shackled upside down by the legs, and killed right in front of them when workers cut their throats. Then it was their turn. A PETA observer saw that some birds flapped their wings and moved their heads as they bled out. A veterinarian who watched the video footage believes that these birds were “showing signs of consciousness and sensibility”—meaning that they were awake as they choked, suffocated, or died of blood loss or shock, “an extremely painful and anxiety provoking condition.”Why Do They Have 'Red Elbows'?A PETA observer documented that about half the birds from had bruises on their wings—or even broken bones or dislocated joints—when they were being butchered. When the observer asked why the birds had “red elbows,” a supervisor at the slaughterhouse responded, “from putting them in the cages.”What You Can Do to Help BirdsEvery time someone purchases a Canada Goose down-filled jacket or any down-filled product, they’re supporting violence against animals. PETA filed a complaint with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Canadian Competition Bureau alleging that Canada Goose was deceiving customers regarding the welfare of geese used for down in its products. Following the FTC’s investigation, Canada Goose no longer claims that its standards ensure that suppliers don’t abuse animals. Nonetheless, the company continues to mislead consumers by hiding the inherent cruelty involved in killing animals for coats.The best way to help geese suffering right now is to avoid buying anything containing down. Canada Goose could easily ditch down today—urge the company to do just that!Please call on Canada Goose to stop selling down immediately, and let the company know that you won’t buy any of its products until it does so. With so many humane, warm materials available today—including PrimaLoft, Thinsulate, ThermoBall, and Plumtech—there’s no excuse for using down.Urge Canada Goose to Ditch Fur and Down!

It’s a violent pastime for twisted people like Liautaud. Hunters pay to kill native and exotic species in “canned hunts” that take place on private land, where it’s difficult to enforce laws that protect wildlife. There’s nothing sporty or athletic about traipsing through animals’ homes and killing them, often with the help of a guide and in an enclosed area from which the animals are unable to escape.Hunting Isn’t the Only Awful Piece of the PuzzleIf you’re boycotting Jimmy John’s for the sake of elephants and other animals, take things a step further by boycotting all cruelty to animals: Go vegan! Not eating animals or their coproducts is a surefire way to help save lives. Jimmy John’s sandwiches may be off the menu, but there are countless vegan-friendly chains and eateries to choose from.

87ÿ2012-12-07ÿÿÿ4ÿPoliticsÿ2ÿpositiveÿ28ÿLushÿ30ÿThe Guardianÿhttps://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/07/shop-ensure-your-cash-isnt-tax-havenÿ"How to shop and ensure your cash isn't going to a tax haven
Amazon, Starbucks, Google, Apple, Boots, Caffe Nero, travel operator Tui ... the list of companies named in the debate over tax avoidance grows ever longer. So where can shoppers spend their hard-earned money and know that the company isn't funnelling the cash offshore and paying virtually no corporation tax? Figures prepared for Guardian Money by Ethical Consumer magazine reveal where you can shop with confidence.
Top of its list is Lush, the high street hand-made cosmetics chain and multinational with operations in more than 40 countries. Yet it has chosen not to use devices such as tax havens and ""transfer pricing"" to hide profits. Researchers at Ethical Consumer found that it paid 42% tax on its £21m profits in the UK last year, giving £8.9m to the Treasury. Amazon, meanwhile, revealed to the Commons public accounts committee last month that it had sales in the UK of £2.9bn, yet paid just £1.8m in tax.
If Amazon enjoys the same level of profit margin as Lush, and paid tax at the same rate, then Amazon would be handing over nearly £100m a year to the Treasury – enough to build five secondary schools.
Other store chains scoring highly in Ethical Consumer's research were John Lewis, which paid 35% tax on its profits last year, Marks & Spencer (27%), Next (26%) and Debenhams (22%). Ethical Consumer examined the percentage of actual tax paid on profits and only included companies that did not have ""high risk"" subsidiaries in tax havens.
Lush co-founder and managing director Mark Constantine accuses Amazon of operating a legal but ""basically corrupt business model"" and reveals how top business people, like himself, are repeatedly touted complex schemes to skirt taxes, such as running profits through Ireland or Luxembourg. ""I could spend all day in meetings with accountants and tax experts who show you how you can pay less. In one year, one of our competitors paid just 2%. But it just doesn't feel right.""
He says tax avoidance in Britain has become such a part of boardroom culture that executives are focusing on these schemes and taking their eye off the main job – running their businesses.
""We are big in Japan and have a lot of Japanese staff. There, they absolutely refuse to fiddle their taxes. From the bottom of the company to the top, the staff would absolutely refuse to do it. What we need here is a return to a climate where businesses are not focussed on strange machinations to avoid tax but, instead, on the important things that make you a commercial success.""
But the government needs to take the lead, he says. ""It has to set the rules and vigorously enforce them. In some ways, I'm embarrassed that our business came top in the Ethical Consumer survey. Other businesses probably think we're stupid. We even looked at taking the tax rates paid by all of our competitors over five years, averaging that out and paying 10% more. But even that would have involved us in schemes we didn't want to get into. It's the government that's got to get a lot more vigorous.""
But shoppers don't have to wait for the government to act – many have already begun their personal boycotts. Margaret Hodge MP was so angered by Amazon's aggressive policies that she has already publicly declared that from now on she will stop using it. A poll that ran on the Guardian's website earlier this week asked readers if they would be boycotting Amazon this Christmas: 53% said they would, but 47% said no. Typical of the comments from those people against was: ""Blame the government for not legislating against tax evasion. Don't blame the companies for saving money.""
Today Ethical Consumer, an independent co-operative that produces guides, ratings and best-buy advice, is launching a broader ""Boycott Amazon"" campaign. Tim Hunt, who calculated the figures on tax for Guardian Money says: ""With this research we hope to give consumers some better options. What we have produced is by no means a definitive list. For example, there will be many small independent retailers paying the proper amount of tax who deserve recognition. However, we wanted to produce a list of widely available brands to make it as easy as possible for consumers to avoid using Amazon.
""Over the past few weeks and months there has been an increasing demand to find alternatives. People are rightly angry and are looking to shop with retailers, both online and on the high street, that pay their fair share.
""The companies we are recommending are paying a much higher rate of tax on their profits than Amazon, and contributing a more proper amount to the public purse. During this time of swingeing public service cuts, we feel that this is vitally important as every penny counts.""
But what of the hundreds of traders that use Amazon Marketplace? Amazon is just a platform on which they sell their goods, and many have voiced serious concerns about losing business from a boycott, even though they pay their fair share of taxes. Ethical Consumer says: ""There's no reason why tax-paying traders should take a hit from our boycott. If you see an item on Amazon that you'd like to buy, simply find the name of the company online and then go to the company's website and buy directly.""

					What’s your favorite smell? Ours is anything that comes without harming a living creature.  Oh, and jasmine. We love the smell of jasmine 🙂And why should the two be mutually exclusive? In today’s world of eco conscious beauty, there are so many cruelty free and vegan perfume brands popping up and promoting a brave new world of sustainable beauty scents
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					FINDING VEGAN AND CRUELTY FREE PERFUME BRANDS
				
				
				
				
					But for us, while vegan and cruelty free attributes are non-negotiable, we review brands using our sustainable personal care criteria, and that means the products on this list will be (as much as possible): all-natural / organic (ideally but not mandatory, as we’ll discuss soon)VeganCruelty-freepalm oil freehave ethical supply chains and ideally use thoughtful packagingBecause traditional perfume is problematic in a few ways, let’s get into more detail about how these criteria pertain to sustainable and eco friendly perfume. What is vegan perfume? Or rather, what is non-vegan perfume?It’s just a bit gross to imagine that inside the beautiful crystal perfume bottle on your vanity is an animal byproduct.The horrifying truth, however, is that some of the world’s favorite fragrances are crafted using animal derived ingredients, including:Civet: an anal gland secretion (yes, seriously) from the endangered civet wildcat. To harvest it, these cats are held in cages and kept alive so they can keep producing the secretion every 10 days. Neither vegan NOR cruelty free.Castoreum: a leather-like smell from the genitals of the castor beaver.Ambergris: a perfume fixative (used to make the smell last longer) made from the digestive tract of sperm whales, sometimes harvested from beaches whales, sometimes from hunted whales.Musk: another glandular secretion from the male East Asian musk deerCan you say, “Eau de… ewww.”But that’s not all. These brands don’t even have to disclose which ingredients are animal byproducts. They don’t even have to disclose the true ingredients at all! They just have to disclose water, denatured ethyl alcohol, and “fragrance”, which can mean literally anything. Basically, the whole perfume industry sustains itself by protecting disgusting trade secrets.So how do we tell a vegan friendly perfume from foe? Well that’s why we’re writing this article.The positive note is that people are starting to demand products that don’t harm or exploit animals. In fact, most modern perfumes have replaced animal odors with synthetic replicators.But is that an issue of its own? Let’s dive deeper…
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					SYNTHETIC VEGAN FRAGRANCES: THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS? 
				
				
				
				
					While synthetics defeat one evil and enable perfumeries to do without animal by-products, they do present an entirely different problem. Namely, these syntehtics can cause a range of health issues. They are also made typically made from non-biodegradable petrochemicals which is not exactly ideal. For us here at Sustainable Jungle, that violates one of our core sustainable personal care criteria: natural / organic ingredients. It seems like we have to weigh the importance of animal welfare vs. our own (and the planet’s). Talk about a catch-22… but let’s look at the pros and cons.While there is plenty more to learn about on this topic and perhaps we’ll go deeper on this at some point, for now we’re prioritizing vegan and cruelty free perfumes. For brands that do include synthetic fragrance, we’ve only included those brands that are transparent about their inclusions and ensure only non-toxic systhetics are used. Of course, the best vegan perfumes for us are those that are made from essential oils rather than synthetic fragrances, so we’ve made sure to include a fair few natural oil-based perfumes, too. 
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					THE REAL ISSUE: FINDING TRULY CRUELTY FREE PERFUME
				
				
				
				
					
							
																					Image by DefineMe
										
					
				
				
				
				
					Perfume’s most prolific and pervasive issue is animal testing.  While vegan perfume brands have become quite prolific, the real challenge is finding perfume brands that are both vegan and cruelty free. Heaps of perfume brands no longer use animal byproducts in their formulas, but they still test their products on animals. Once again, we find ourselves in that troublesome ethical gap between vegan and cruelty free. These terms are not synonymous.Here’s the thing: many perfume companies don’t directly sanction animal testing on their products. They brand themselves as “cruelty free”. However, that doesn’t mean they’re entirely against animal testing. For example, these brands may choose to sell products into countries like China, where pre-retail animal testing is legally mandated for any and all beauty products. In the end, these cruelty free perfume brands aren’t truly cruelty free. They’re knowingly selling products in a territory that requires animal testing. They’re complicit in the animal cruelty that is taking place. All this for the sake of profit.And then there’s the whole mess of perfume parent companies and licensing agreements. Essentially a cruelty free and vegan perfume brand can be owned by a larger corporation that is not cruelty free and sells into China. This is the reason most heavy hitting luxury perfume brands, like Vera Wang and Marc Jacobs, can’t be considered cruelty free. We’re not here to call out companies, though. For that, Cruelty-Free Kitty has done a great job of using succinct infographics for listing perfume brands that either directly test on animals or sell into China.Instead, we’re here to stay positive about the perfumes, and the remarkable strides the industry is making (even if it’s not perfect yet). We’ve been spending a lot of time sniffing out not just the best vegan perfumes, but those that don’t support animal testing in any way, shape, or smell! So without further eau de adieu, here are some of the best cruelty free perfumes we could find.

					About Clean Beauty Collective Vegan, Cruelty Free PerfumesWhen researching this article, we were excited to discover that Sephora’s vegan perfume brand list is actually pretty extensive. the trick though is finding brands that are also cruelty free.To the rescue, Clean Beauty Collective is an excellent cruelty free perfume brand at Sephora. They’re also considered a “Clean at Sephora” brand.And they really embrace that “clean” branding. Even the elegant square bottles look crisp and clean with all white labels and classy wooden caps. Their scents come in three main categories:Clean Classic: linear and simple fragrances for the dayClean Reserve: “farm to fragrance” scents made from sustainably harvested flowers and herbs. This includes soothing scents like Citron Fig and Velvet Flora.Clean Reserve Avant Garden: as with the previous, but with a slightly more exotic twistEach of the fragrances consist of a blend of natural plant essences and non-toxic phthalate-free synthetics. For the full list of ingredients they don’t use, see here.But don’t let the use of synthetics end your curiosity, because even those have been carefully chosen: Whether it’s sustainably sourced or tried-and-true synthetics—we’re proud to say we always put you and the environment first. And we never test on animals. That’s our promise.CBC uses glycerin which is a common palm oil derivative. We are confirming their palm oil policis directly with them.  Lastly, CBC has a little something for every budget, from affordable roller ball options to more high end vegan perfumes that cost close to $100.

					About Phlur Vegan, Cruelty Free PerfumesWe think this is one of the best vegan, cruelty free perfume brands around (see why below). It’s no surprise then that it’s also another “Clean at Sephora” vegan perfume. Phlur is Leaping Bunny-certified internationally cruelty free. The Fragrance Foundation’s Indie Fragrance nominee Hanami is their best-seller, with rave reviews for its calming, creamy sweetness derived from fig and sandalwood notes.Aside from all products being highly rated, Phlur makes the shopping process fun. Browse their 11 different scent families through engaging product pages that helpfully convey not just the perfume notes (which, let’s be honest, can get a bit pretentious and ambiguous when it comes to perfumes) but the weight and longevity.  There’s even Spotify playlists that match the mood of each fragrance family! Creative!We love their “conscious choice” section which describes how Phlur supports sustainability with that particular fragrance. For instance, in their Moab, they describe how the fragrance’s ingredient snowbell tree resin is sourced fair trade from a company in Honduras that helps continue the traditional of sustainable resin harvesting.Because transparency trumps all, they publicly disclose every ingredient. No tricky trade secrets, no sketchy secret formulas. You can even check their full company ingredient list here, all of which has been confirmed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a non-threatened plant species.While they opt for natural whenever possible, they do openly use some synthetic fragrances and musks, though never questionable or unsafe synthethics such as nitro or polycyclic musks. They also use no parabens.The only downside is that they are a bit spendy compared to others on this list. If you’re not convinced you’ll love it give their sample size a try – should last roughly a month with daily use.
				
				
				
				
					About PhlurAustin-based and founded as recently as 2016, Phlur is a young vegan perfume brand (that also makes lotion, body wash, and candles) that aims at creating “Good. Clean. Fun”. Their business is built entirely around conscious choice:What’s a conscious choice? It’s a decision made by being mindful, by daring to ask why things are the way they are. And it’s the foundation of everything we do.These core conscious choices that define Phlur are:“Make fragrance without compromise.” Not only are no animals harmed by their products, they coordinate with IUCN to ensure top quality, ethically sourced ingredients all around.“Make fragrance that feels as great as it smells.” No skin irritants or stabilizers, ever.“Package everything with integrity.”  Not only are the glass bottles 20% recycled glass with vegetable based paint (making them fully recyclable), the glass is opaque. That helps filter out light and elongate the life of your perfume.“Design the experience around discovery.” Luxury goes beyond the celebrity sponsored name or fashion branding. “Give back in any way we can.” They’re a certified B-Corp, part of the American Sustainable Business Council, and a member of 1% for the Planet. $5 of every bottle sold goes to either the ICUN or the Central Park Conservancy “Work with like-minded people.” Run by a husband and wife duo, their carefully chosen team of world class perfumers is full of mindful, eco conscious individuals.“Keep an open mind.” Have suggestions?

They’ve been recognized for their ethical beauty practices by The Ethical Company Organisation and Good Shopping Guide.And they donate an inspiring 10% of profits (a sizeable percentage as far as charitable giving is concerned) to environmental and social causes.Aside from perfume, they also make tons of bath and body products, skin care, lip care and gift baskets of all the above.Many of their products are 100% natural, and the rest are mostly natural, as they do use some synthetic aroma molecules. Part of their ethical policy is to reduce “green-washing” in the industry and to them, all manner of ills are covered by using buzzwords such as “natural.” For example, Palm oil is natural but very harmful to the environment, Arsenic is natural, but you wouldn’t want to put it on your skin. Per Bloomtown, “Lots of synthetics are actually better for your skin and the environment. Synthetic musk, for example, prevented the extinction of the musk deer, which was hunted for its glands. And plenty of natural essential oils have just as many, if not more, allergens and irritants as their synthetic counterparts.”

					About For Strange Women Cruelty Free, Vegan PerfumeFor Strange Women are creators of the artisanal avant-garde. For those who want to get away from traditional feminine scents in favor of something a little more understated and unique. While you’ll still find some classic fresh floral options, you’ll also get plenty of unique scent experiences, like Tobacco + Leather and cozy fireside-inspired scents like Coffee + Cocoa.We’re intrigued by the Decadence + Debauchery fragrance, a blend of immortelle, amber, violet, sweet tobacco, and vanilla.  Made “for burlesque beauties and Victorian darlings alike”, reviews call it “deep, luscious and naughty”.  Who says ethically good perfumes can’t sometimes be a little bad…in the right way, of course.Their glass vialed cruelty free perfume oils, solid perfume tins, and perfume jewelry are all natural, free from synthetic fragrances, phthalates, parabens and alcohol.  Scents are instead derived from essential oils and plant essences and blended into a coconut and jojoba oil base.What’s really unique about these perfumes is that while floral notes fade over time on the shelf, the perfume doesn’t lose its power. Rather than expire, the scent actually evolves toward earthier notes!For Strange Women also make some beautiful Perfume Jewelry. Natural perfumes don’t last quite as long as synthetic so these are great for re-applying on the go.We have confirmd that For Strange Women is cruelty-free and entirely palm oil free. While their Oil Perfumes are vegan (made in a jojoba wax base), their solid perfumes are made in a beeswax base and therefore not vegan. A few of their other products lso contain beeswax.

					About Walden Natural Cruelty Free , Vegan PerfumeHere’s one for our UK readers. Inspired by Henry David Thoreau’s iconic transcendental devotional of the same name, “Walden Natural Perfumes are proud to walk in his footsteps”. In fact, each of the six scents are named in reference to various lines of the book. For instance, Castles in the Air recalls the line, “If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost. that is where they should be.  Now put the foundations under them.”Castles in the Air’s citrus and lavender blend is a fresh, relaxing fragrance that, according to several reviews, boosts the wearer’s mood.And since they’re packaged in 50ml elegant square glass bottles with appropriately earthy wooden caps, they’ll even boost your mood just sitting on your vanity.These natural perfumes are made in small batches of pure essential oil, resins and natural absolutes. No synthetic fragrances.The goal is that each wearer can use these simple and pure scents to channel the “simple living in harmony with nature” that Thoreau embodies during his two year stay at Walden Pond.
				
				
				
				
					About Walden Based in the UK, Walden is proud to adhere to the 6 cornerstone values of the Real Beauty Manifesto: compassion, honesty, purity, community, transparency and sustainability.We quite like what Walden has to say about it all:Walden is proud to continue the traditions of high perfumery, when master perfumers blended the finest natural ingredients into fragrant masterpieces. When the price of their creations reflected the cost of the ingredients and not the overhead of the armies of sprayers positioned in every airport duty-free or the celebrities shilling the mass produced chemical cocktails that pass for perfumes there.They are 100% vegan and do not support animal testing practices in any way. We’d say Walden Natural Perfumes are some of the best vegan perfumes in the UK.We are currently confirming their policies directly with them.

					About Natural Wisdom Spa Vegan, Cruelty Free PerfumeWe hope this list hasn’t turned away male readers. Natural Wisdom Spa makes not just perfumes, but vegan cologne as well, in either spray or solid form. The Sandalwood Forest Vegan Cologne looks particularly earthy and enticing. Who needs overpowering musks when you can opt for sandalwood, juniper, cypress, and oak moss? These natural vegan perfumes are made from German-sourced organic CO2 extracted oils that pass the strict qualifiers for being considered food grade, not just cosmetic grade. In making the perfumes, the raw oils remains uncooked, so as not to remove any antioxidants, and are never diluted with carrier oils, wax emulsifiers, synthetic fragrances, dyes, gluten or alcohol.One of the most unique elements of the perfumes is the packaging. The solids come in beautiful sustainably-sourced cedar wooden pots made by a female-run wood co-op in Morocco. The spray perfumes come packaged in bio-photonic Miron violet glass, which protects it from weakening due to light and air. According to the company, this gives the fragrances a lifespan between 18-24 months. A huge amount of excellent reviews (over a 1000) seems to agree with this and that the scents lose very little to no strength over time.They are also phasing out plastic pumps to move toward zero waste perfumes but will still provide one upon request – so make sure you specify your zero waste requirements! 
				
				
				
				
					About Natural Wisdom SpaNatural Wisdom Spa was started in 2007 by Maeve Brazi, a professional artisan perfumer trained in Grasse, France.  According to Maeve:“My passion for the natural world and ecology are the inspiration for all my recipes.  It’s my belief that in the making of something new, we shouldn’t hurt our planet. It’s a choice not an inevitability. Our planet has given us everything we need to thrive without resorting to earth damaging practices. We have a choice.” Preach! We’re so glad to see these attitudes recognized by major awards, too. This year, in 2019, Natural Wisdom Spa received Sublime Magazine’s Good Brand Award. In addition to natural, vegan perfumes, she makes an abundance of other vegan skin care products, including face creams, oils, cleansers and toners, masks, and exfoliators.  They also craft natural lip balms, deodorants, and shampoo bars and can make custom products for any of the above categories.Everything is made in small, fresh batches while adhering to the stringent standards of the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).  “No nonsense. No compromise.”Maeve is so confident in her products that she offers a 100% guarantee that you’ll love them.While the perfumes appear to be palm oil free, we are confirming Natural Wisdome Spa’s policies with them directly.

					About Eden Vegan, Cruelty Free PerfumeTo be clear, we mean Eden Perfumes, not the classic, all-caps luxury version, EDEN.For being a small family run operation, Eden Perfumes make tons of scents, sans synthetics, phthalates and parabens. Not only are they all natural, 80%-90% of the ingredients are certified organic.Here’s the really cool part: the whole company concept is that they’re providing affordable, vegan alternatives to legendary luxury scents. For instance, their No. 533 Fierce Woman fragrance is the cruelty-free vegan version of Abercrombie & Fitch’s Fierce for Her.Even more famously, their best selling No. 007 is the cruelty-free answer to Chanel’s No. 5. The similarity isn’t just hype, either. Reviews on various independent websites rave about how indistinguishable it really is from Marilyn Monroe’s favorite subdued floral scent!  If it’s truly anything like Chanel No. 5, it’s got to be be one of the best smelling cruelty free perfumes around. The Independent even named it their choice for Indy Best Buy for cruelty free vegan perfumes available in the UK.For ease of perusing pleasure, their perfumes are conveniently separated into categories: Ladies, for vegan perfume, choose between fruity, floral, and oriental scents.  Gentleman, for vegan aftershave, choose between woody, aromatic, and oriental scent groupings. They also make unisex fragrances and citrus ones. 
				
				
				
				
					About Eden PerfumesBrighton-based, this small UK cruelty free vegan perfume brand was founded by an all vegan family. As such everything is certified by The Vegan Society.In the effort toward even greater sustainability, they minimize packaging and bottling by creating more concentrated perfumes at 15% intensity. This means they are Eau de Parfum rather than Eau de Toilette. All this leads us to believe these are some of the best vegan perfumes in the UK.  Unfortunately, major pharmacies and beauty stores like Boots do not (yet?) carry Eden. In fact, cruelty free perfume at Boots for instance seems to be a bit of a wild goose chase (let us know if we’re wrong though)!We are confirming palm oil, sourcing and packaging policies directly with this brand. 
				
				
				
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
						
		
				
				
				
					About Lush Cruelty Free and Vegan PerfumesLush is easily one of the best known brands in the vegan cruelty free space. They craft all vegan perfume spray, perfume oil, solid perfume, wash cards and even cruelty free perfume body spray. At around £39 for 100ml, it’s also a very affordable cruelty free perfume.And they have one of the best selections out there! With wildly different offerings on the scent spectrum Lush offers something for everyone.And while perfume companies tend to be pretty great at writing enticing descriptors, Lush wins all.  Take their scent description of their Lust fragrance: “unabashedly carnal jasmine”.  So good!Seriously, they have a scent for every occasion. Wear the sweet and girlie Amelie Mae (named after Head perfumer Simon Constantine’s youngest daughter) to brunch with the girls, then switch to the “boozy and smokey” All Good Things for a night out.We also love that they openly disclose all the ingredients for each perfume and even color code the text on their website to visually differentiate between natural ingredients and safe synthetics. Just note that while scents are primarily derived from essential oils, these perfumes are not totally natural or alcohol free. About 25% of the ingredients are synthetic.
				
				
				
				
					About LushAfter having been around the beauty block for over three decades, they know a thing or two about the cosmetics industry. As with their vast perfume selection, Lush makes tons of makeup, skincare, dental care and any other beauty product you can imagine.Even though Lush as a company is not 100% natural or entirely palm oil free, their no tolerance attitude toward animal testing is pretty darn admirable. Not only do they not test on animals they only sell to (and purchase from) suppliers and stockists that are also cruelty free.Read more about their cruelty-free cosmetics stance here. You can even watch it in video form, complete with cute puppies (in case you need more convincing that animal testing is just stupid and wrong).And to literally put their money where their mouth is, the company gives out an annual Lush Award, a tradition that started in 2012. This generous £250,000 prize is awarded to an individual or group working toward replacing animal ingredients, whether it be through science, political lobbying or just plain raising awareness.They also clearly outline where they are on their palm oil journey – read more here.
				
				
				
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
						
		
				
				
				
					About Kat Von D Vegan, Cruelty Free Perfume brandChoose your side in a classic bottle.  Are you a Sinner? Or are you a Saint?For a high end cruelty free perfume, get a whiff of Kat Von D’s Sinner / Saint series. While these two perfumes “share the same floral soul” Saint is sweet and refreshing, while Sinner is edgy and spicy. Some suggest  wearing them together for a more complex experience. Between the two, the musky vanilla and jasmine notes of Saint Eau de Parfum has three times as many reviews (over 3,000) but both scents have both been highly rated. Sinner is a bit heavier, trading in the soft feminine notes for unapologetic (yet not overpowering is the consensus) sexy cinnamon elements.They come packaged in stunning white or black glass flacons that “reminded [Kat] of a human heart when she held it in her hand”. A 100ml bottle will go for around $85 (though they often go on sale so watch this space!), or get them in travel sized spritzer vials.
				
				
				
				
					About Kat Von DThe edgy and bold Kat Von D brand makes “makeup made with love, not animals”, for everyone from beginners with a brush (which they also sell a whole vegan line of) to professional makeup artists. We love how invested Kat is. In fact, she has a heavy hand in every aspect of product development, from testing them on herself to packaging design. For instance, Kat is the artist behind the lovely filigree scrollwork on the Sinner / Saint perfumes. Kat Von D (and their parent company Kendo) is PETA certified cruelty free. They do not sell  into China, unlike other luxury perfumes like Ralph Lauren, Dolce & Gabbana, Dior, and Marc Jacobs.While all products are historically not all vegan, the entire product line was recently tweaked to ensure 100% vegan status. This meant eliminating common cosmetic ingredients like beeswax and carmine so they can practice truly “fur free artistry”.They’re also all about ethical sourcing through supply chains that adhere to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. We are confirming their packaging and palm oil policies directly with them. 
				
				
				
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					A WORD FOR OUR U.K. READERS
				
				
				
				
					We’ve included options from both the U.S.’s Sephora and Ulta, so you may be asking yourselves, “What about Boots? Are there any cruelty free perfumes available at Boots?”The answer is unfortunately, no. We tried very hard to find some suitable cruelty free and vegan perfumes at Boots. We even looked at comprehensive lists of major cruelty-free beauty brands in the UK. We just couldn’t find anything we felt confident enough in their cruelty free status to recommend. The closest we found to cruelty free perfume available at Boots was a brand called Soap & Glory, which makes their Original Pink fragrance perfume, as well as other vegan perfume body sprays.  While the company claims to be entirely cruelty free and to regularly audit their suppliers, their website has some suspicious fine print saying “no retailer or manufacturer can categorically state that ‘none’ of their raw materials have […] been tested on animals”. Ethical Elephant did some digging and reached out, but still came to inconclusive results. Their official stance on the company is to “buy or boycott at your own discretion”. It’s also worth mentioning that Boots themselves, while “cruelty free”, still sell into China and Thailand. Which is an instant disqualifier for us.There are still plenty of excellent cruelty free perfumes in the UK, as we hope we’ve pointed out. You might just need to shop a bit outside your usual haunts.
				
				
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
				
					Because natural ingredients are not designed to hold for, well, unnatural lengths of time. Especially for 100% natural perfumes free from all synthetic preservatives or stabilizers, you’ll find these options will have a shorter shelf life. Hence some of the complaints of natural fragrances not lasting very long.However, with proper care, you can easily extend the life of your perfume and keep it smelling strong and succulent by:keeping your bottle away from direct sunlight. This can kill the fragrance and deactivate natural plant essences.keeping the air tightly sealed out. This is literally as simple as always putting the lid back on nice and tight. Air can also deactivate and change the fragrance.buying only what you intend to use. Only use perfume for special occasions? Maybe go for a travel-sized vial, or a size that you’re sure you’ll go through. That avoids waste and save you money!
				
				
				
				
						
			
		
						
			
		
				
						
				
				
			
					
				
				
					FINAL THOUGHTS ON CRUELTY FREE AND VEGAN PERFUME
				
				
				
				
					The takeaway from all this? Animal testing is abhorrent. Perfumes that encourage animal testing are also repugnant (in more ways than one).Fortunately there are many fur friendly fragrances out there, and we genuinely hope this list has helped s(m)ell you on to making the switch.Cruelty free perfume (more so than vegan perfume) is still somewhat of a tricky avenue to navigate. With that in mind, we’ve probably missed some great cruelty free perfume brands. Please let us know if we did, especially if you happen to know of any cruelty free perfumes at Boots or other major UK beauty retailers for our UK readers.Or just let us know how you like any of the perfumes on our list. We love getting fragrant feedback! Drop a note in the comment or in our inbox!

Photo: Thomas Kelly Slack / Courtesy of Maggie MarilynIf Maggie Marilyn isn’t satisfied with her sustainability efforts yet, then two things must be true. First, that virtually every designer is miles behind (because who has more ambitious goals than Marilyn?), and second, that for all of her progress and dedication, there are bigger systems in place that simply won’t allow for certain changes. Much of it comes down to economies of sale—regardless of how great a new sustainable fiber or solution might be, it also needs to be commercially viable. The old-school, out-of-touch wholesale model is also a culprit.Marilyn admits she’s “hit a brick wall” with certain retailers that refuse to embrace her missive: Some of them have told her sustainability simply isn’t a priority for their customer. A few e-commerce sites present her collection without mentioning the word “sustainability” at all, while others share little to no information about her organic and recycled materials, her open-source platform, or her efforts to rebuild New Zealand’s manufacturing industry. It’s only on her own website and Instagram (and in reported features like this) that Marilyn can tell you the full story and go into detail about where her merino wool comes from, why you should do less laundry (did you know the sun is a natural detergent?), the problems associated with virgin synthetics, and so on.Not surprisingly, it’s through her direct channels that Marilyn’s customers are the most engaged. Since her 2016 launch she’s received heartfelt emails from women around the world who relate to her values, but many of them can’t justify spending $755 on a silk party dress or $1,400 on an organic wool blazer. “It really made me think about how sustainability shouldn’t be a luxury, it should be something everyone can buy into,” Marilyn says.It sparked the idea of a new “core” collection of simple, accessibly-priced items that every woman has a purpose for: T-shirts, button-downs, sweaters, blazers. (Not all of us need a party dress more than once or twice a year, so it isn’t really worth the investment, but everyone could use a great T-shirt.) Aesthetically, Marilyn also felt she needed some minimal, no-brainer basics to ground the statement-making fashion in her main line. “I wanted pieces that would make it really easy to wear those colorful, out-there skirts or jackets, but I don’t think our customer should have to pay $300 for a T-shirt,” she explains. Her existing model would have required that, to allow room for wholesale margins. So Marilyn took a different route: She’s selling her new essentials line, titled “Somewhere,” exclusively on her website, with prices starting at $65 for an organic cotton tee. (A cotton-wool blazer tops out the range at $420, with $90 turtlenecks, $170 jeans, and $205 cardigans in between.)At a celebratory dinner on Hester Street on Wednesday night, Marilyn made a compelling case for buying one of each: She wore the T-shirt, blazer, and jeans in head-to-toe cream. Her shoes were the same strappy heels the model wears in the lookbook here. She joked that it was probably the first time any of us had seen her not wearing neon pastels or primary hues, but she admitted there are days when she isn’t feeling pink stripes and periwinkle trousers. sometimes you just want something easy, comfy, and vaguely nostalgic: straight-leg jeans, a fine-knit sweater, and maybe a just-oversized-enough blazer to grab on your way out the door.Homebrook farm in Blenheim, New Zealand, where Marilyn sourced her organic merino wool.Photo: Courtesy of Maggie MarilynThat ease and straightforwardness belies the serious work that went into the capsule, which was two years in the making: “We pushed back the launch a few times, because I really wanted to get the product perfect,” she says. Much of her time was focused on tweaking the length of a sleeve or refining the jacket’s tailoring, but just as much—if not more—energy went into the materials sourcing and manufacturing. Like Marilyn’s main line, the fabrics here are as sustainable as it gets—mostly organic cotton and organic merino wool, plus one pair of recycled nylon leggings—but she took it a step further: Every item was designed with the intention of one day being recycled when Marilyn launches a “take-back scheme” in 2021.“I realized that if I want to create this accessibly-priced line of basics, even though they’re made with the same values [as my main collection], inevitably if something costs less, people attach less value to it, and maybe it feels disposable,” she says. “I had a problem with that, so I knew that when a garment has been loved a little too much, there has to be an opportunity for it to be taken back and recycled into a new one.” It’s a concept that’s still new in the industry. the Los Angeles company For Days makes organic cotton T-shirts and sweatshirts you can send back to be recycled into new ones, and earlier this year, Adidas introduced the beta version of its fully-recyclable running shoes. It’s the recycling technology that’s complex. designing into it is simpler. While many “organic cotton” T-shirts still have polyester threads or tags, which impede the recycling process, Marilyn’s are 100 percent organic cotton, so they can essentially be thrown into a shredder and spun into another T-shirt.Even the merino-cotton blazers will be a breeze to break down, because natural fibers are the easiest to recycle, and Marilyn considered the recyclability of every additional detail, from the stitching to the interior construction to the buttons. “The problem right now is that people are trying to find solutions for recycling [existing] garments that weren’t designed this way.”Since the capsule will be sold exclusively online, it’s worth mentioning that the fabrics are more luxe than the prices suggest. The cotton is substantial and velvet-y. the blazers are gently structured, not rigid. the tech-y recycled nylon leggings (which are fully recyclable, too) have a touch of evening-worthy sheen. and the layer-able turtlenecks aren’t cotton, but an ultra-fine merino wool. Marilyn’s website will outline precisely where every fiber was sourced, spun, and dyed, and eventually where the garment was actually manufactured. The cardigan, for instance, uses wool sourced from Homebrook farm in Blenheim, New Zealand, which was spun and dyed at the GOTS-certified Südwolle mill in Zhangjiagang, China, and manufactured at Textile Creations in Auckland, New Zealand.Marilyn doesn’t hesitate to admit that these pieces are “better” than many of her past collections, in terms of sustainability. “It’s really been a back-to-school process for me, to be honest,” she says. “The main line still has our foundational values, where we can trace the supply chain and use the best fabrics that are available now. But when you get into the nitty-gritty of knowing the farmers that make your wool, you really start to understand the challenges they face along the supply chain, and then you can work on helping everyone improve their processes at every tier. With the main line, that’s something we’ve never had the time to do, because once we get to that step, a new collection is arriving,” she continues. “So this new collection is almost like a laboratory for how a ‘perfect’ fashion system could work. And hopefully in a few years time, we’ll be able to adapt all of these learnings to the main line.” You can stock up at maggiemarilyn.com starting today."ÿÿMaggie Marilyn’s New Sustainable Basics Are Fully Recyclable—So You’ll Never Throw Out an Old T-Shirt Again

Consumer rights legal firm Hagens Berman initiated legal action against Nestlé earlier this month. It alleged the confectioner failed to inform consumers cocoa in its chocolate may come from child or slave labor.
It told ConfectioneryNews at the time it also intended to sue Hershey and Mars.
Consumer Danell Tomasella –who also brought the lawsuit Nestlé – filed two separate class action complaints against Mars and Hershey in Massachusetts district court on Monday (February 26).
Earlier lawsuits against Nestlé USA, Mars and Hershey dismissed

Law firm Hagen Berman previously represented private consumers Elaine McCoy (against Nestlé USA), Laura Dana (against Hershey) and Robert Hodson (versus Mars) in lawsuits intiated in September 2015. The suits alleged companies had failed to disclose cocoa in some chocolate brands may come from slave labor. A district court in California threw out the suits in 2016. The judge said it was not “sound policy” to compel manufacturers to disclose certain facts on packaging. “There are countless issues that may be legitimately important to many customers, and the courts are not suited to determine which should occupy the limited surface area of a chocolate wrapper,” he said.
‘Failed to inform’ at point-of-sale
“Like Nestle, Mars and Hershey’s have failed to take action on this issue, despite clear knowledge of their support of the use of child and slave labor, and have also failed to inform consumers at point-of-sale that their purchases are supporting this supply chain linked directly to atrocious human rights violations,” said Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman.
The suits allege Mars and Hershey have violated the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, which states “unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful”.
Mars: ‘Progress has been far too slow’
A Mars Wrigley Confectionery US spokesperson told ConfectioneryNews: “While we don’t comment on pending litigation, we believe that the worst forms of child labor have no place in the future of sustainable cocoa.”
They said child labor continues to be a challenge in West Africa’s cocoa sector.
“Mars has been working to address this challenge both on our own and through collaboration across sectors for years, and yet our view is that progress has been far too slow.""
The lawsuits against Mars and Hershey allege the chocolate industry repeatedly broke promises made in 2005 in the Harkin-Engel Protocol to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in Côte d’Ivoire by 2005.
The deadline was postponed to 2008, to 2010, and now to 2020, according to the complaint.
Mars’ spokesperson said: “While this is a complex issue with numerous drivers, we believe it can and must be addressed. We must identify and activate new and innovative strategies, partnerships and programs as we work across government, industry and civil society to make progress.”
Hershey points to certified volumes
Jeff Beckman, director of corporate communications at Hershey, said the Reese’s maker stood by its earlier comments to ConfectioneryNews.
“We are now sourcing more than 75% of our cocoa for our products around the world from certified and sustainable sources verified by independent authorities and will be at 100% by 2020.
“Certification includes strict regulations for cocoa farms, including prohibiting illegal and forced child labor in accordance with International Labour Organization conventions,” he told us earlier this month.

              There is a lot of confusion in the recycling industry at the moment, but the one thing most can seem to agree on is that the future is circular. Central to moving towards a circular economy is products designed to last and to be fully recyclable. Method are the makers of beautiful recycling bins that are not only beautiful but effectively facilitate the circular economy in modern organisations.
Method began when co-founders Steven and India Korner continued to see organisations that wanted to recycle without the tools to be successful. They believed that a well designed bin had the power to change workplace recycling behaviours, and they were right. The innovative bins and leading philosophy of Open Plan Recycling have made recycling, waste and sustainable practice part of a buildings DNA.
More so, the bins are designed to be long lasting and fully recyclable in a circular fashion. The bins are made from polypropylene, a durable and strong plastic, including 50% recycled materials. While introducing recycled materials into their bins Method was focused on making sure that it was done in a way that doesn’t impact their recyclability. Meaning that the bins made from recycled materials can be made into bins again and again – at the end of their long life.
At its core Method works to facilitate the circular economy, keeping materials in use for as long as possible. so this considered design is critical to Method’s success both as a product manufacturer and sustainability facilitators.
This means that Method’s bins are capturing the materials to produce their own products, seeing the circular economy in action now. The journey isn’t over yet, Methods internal research and development and sustainability teams are constantly working to establish the supply and infrastructure required to achieve 100% recycled materials.

The Method System
The  beautiful bins are placed together to form flexible recycling stations that are positioned out in the open in modern workplaces. Recycling rates are improved through visibility, increased accountability and the removal of easy general waste options, such as desk bins. Being out in the open users are more likely to consider where their waste goes, even subconsciously, when they are visible to others. Whereas, traditional options such as desk bins allow users to easily place all of their waste into one bin.
The recycling stations become a featured part of a building’s design, acting as a visible statement of an organisations commitment to sustainability.
Method are the long term sustainability partner of innovative and leading facilities around the world. including the Sydney Cricket Ground, Qantas, The Office Group’s coworking spaces and Foster + Partners in London.

Thanks you so much to those of you who emailed Microsoft’s CEO asking him to investigate the use of child labour in parts they source to make their products.
Thanks to you and our supporters around the world Microsoft are beginning to bow to pressure.
They released a report in October 2018 setting out the steps they’ve taken to map their cobalt supply chain. While this is progress, Microsoft has a long way to go to meet our concerns and international standards.
The company has yet to tell us exactly how they’re identifying, preventing and addressing potential human rights abuses in their cobalt supply chain.
We’re halting our action for the moment, but we won’t let Microsoft rest until they follow up on their commitments, and there is real evidence of change on the ground in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The story so far
“I worked in the mines because my parents couldn’t afford to pay for food and clothes for me. There is lots of dust. It is very easy to catch colds. We hurt all over.”Paul, 14, started working in the mines at 12
Our investigators have uncovered terrible exploitation of children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Children as young as seven are mining cobalt, toiling in dangerous conditions for the rare metal that’s a crucial component in our laptops and mobile phones.
It’s backbreaking work. 12 hours a day they lug huge, heavy sacks, breathing in toxic dust,. They have no protection for their young bodies – no gloves and no masks.
Our damning evidence
Using public records we tracked the supply of this hand-dug cobalt, through a company in China, to some of the biggest consumer electronics corporations in the world.
After raising our concerns, some companies we spoke to have taken steps to investigate their supply chains and have helped by publishing lists of their cobalt smelters and refiners in line with international standards.
However, none are doing enough to stop human rights abuses in their supply chains. None have said they’ll help improve the situation for those harmed by their operations. Although the price of cobalt has soared, the miners have seen none of the benefits.
Child labour is a human rights issue
Our researchers found that child miners in the DRC work in extremely dangerous conditions, with inadequate safety equipment, for very little money.
This is one of the worst forms of child labour, which governments are required to prohibit and eliminate.
Corporations are also required by UN standards to identify and prevent adverse impacts on human rights. This means they must disclose what they’re doing to make sure child labour isn’t being used anywhere in their cobalt supply chain.

It’s hard to think of an issue that you would less like your company to be associated with than modern slavery. Yet last November Nestlé, the world’s largest foodmaker and one of the most recognisable household brands, went public with the news it had found forced labour in its supply chains in Thailand and that its customers were buying products tainted with the blood and sweat of poor, unpaid and abused migrant workers.
By independently disclosing that Nestlé customers had unwittingly bought products contaminated by the very worst labour abuses, the company said it was moving into a new era of self-policing of its own supply chains. A year-long investigation by the company confirmed media reports that the seafood industry in Thailand is riddled with forced labour and human trafficking and that slave labour was involved in the production of its Fancy Feast catfood brand.
Nestlé also made sure to make it clear that no other company sourcing seafood from Thailand, the world’s third-largest seafood exporter, could have avoided being exposed to the same risks.
“As we’ve said consistently, forced labour and human rights abuses have no place in our supply chain,” said Magdi Batato, Nestlé’s executive vice-president in charge of operations, in a written statement. “Nestlé believes that by working with suppliers we can make a positive difference to the sourcing of ingredients.”
The disclosure was considered by many to be ground-breaking. Nick Grono, the chief executive of NGO the Freedom Fund, which has invested heavily in anti-trafficking initiatives in Thailand, believes Nestlé’s admission could be a considerable force in shifting the parameters of what can be expected of businesses when it comes to supply chain accountability.
“Nestlé’s decision to conduct this investigation is to be applauded,” he says. “If you’ve got one of the biggest brands in the world proactively coming out and admitting that they have found slavery in their business operations, then it’s potentially a huge game-changer and could lead to real and sustained change in how supply chains are managed.”
The research (pdf) for Nestlé’s report was conducted by US corporate accountability business Verité, which works closely with organisations trying to help improve their supply chain transparency.
Last year Verité was involved in another exercise in self-disclosure by outdoor clothing company Patagonia, which announced that it had discovered several points in its supply chain in Taiwan where forced labour and unethical recruitment practices were flourishing.
Verite’s chief executive, Dan Viederman, said: “In the last six months Verité has been involved in two high-profile disclosures from major brands and one of the most important lessons for us to recognise is that in neither case did the companies suffer greatly in terms of being associated with these labour conditions. Instead, they received some credit [for] being bold enough to be associated with this.”
“I really hope that the recent examples help mobilise companies to be bolder and investigate more deeply because soon the reputational damage in not doing so could be considerable”
For Viederman, the biggest issue is working out how to manage the disclosures into actual change for vulnerable people trapped at the bottom of global commodity chains.
Cleaning up the supply chain
There is also a growing legal imperative for many large multinationals to start seriously engaging with labour abuses in their business operations. Legislation in both the US and the UK requires larger companies to publish annual reports on their efforts to keep their businesses slavery-free.
The success of the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act has been patchy but it has spawned a series of civil litigation suits, with consumers or workers using the legislation to launch legal actions against companies they accuse of making misleading public statements on their anti-slavery efforts.
Nestlé is one of the companies facing legal action in the US. Last week the company, along with Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, failed in its bid to get the US Supreme Court to throw out a lawsuit seeking to hold them liable for the alleged use of child slaves in cocoa farming in the Ivory Coast.
This puts the company in the unfortunate position of disclosing slavery in one part of its operations, while at the same time fighting through the courts to fend off accusations that it exists in another – more profitable – part of its business.
Andrew Wallis, chief executive of Unseen UK, an anti-trafficking charity advocating for more supply chain accountability, said: “For me there is a big issue with one part of Nestlé saying, ‘OK we have been dragged along with everyone else to face the issue of slavery in Thailand and so let’s take the initiative and do something about it’, and at the same time fighting tooth and nail through the courts to avoid charges of child slavery in its core operations in the Ivory Coast.”
He argues that Nestlé’s self-reporting could also be seen as a tactic to head off or deflate other pending civil litigation suits.
“It’s easy to own up to something that has already been uncovered,” he says. “By the time Nestlé owned up to slavery in the Thai seafood industry it was accepted knowledge. It’ll be a brave new world when companies are actually doing the real investigation to probe into part of their supply chains that have remained outside the public domain.
“We need to move into a space where we say, ‘We’re all guilty. let’s get past that to a place where we can properly address the problem’ – and I don’t think we’re there yet.”

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, I gave Nestlé chair Peter Brabeck, a present – an original, signed copy of The Baby Killer, the 1974 report that I wrote for War on Want.
The Baby Killer explained how multinational milk companies like his were causing infant illness and death in poor communities by promoting bottle feeding and discouraging breast feeding.
Our Swiss associates were less subtle. They titled the report ""Nestlé Toten Babies"" (or Nestlé Kills Babies), which a Swiss court found was libelous. On the substance of the argument, however, the judge warned Nestlé that if the company did not want to face accusations of causing death and illness through sales practices such as using sales reps dressed in nurses' uniforms, they should change the way that they did business.
That shocked the company and undermined its benevolent self-image. It also launched a long-running global campaign, proving that networked social action was possible even in snail mail days.
Nestlé boycotts spread from Switzerland and Britain to the US, where shareholder activism and court challenges against other milk companies – led by the Sisters of the Precious Blood, a religious order working under the umbrella of the Interfaith Centre for Corporate Responsibility – achieved a fine balance between grassroots organising, legal process and catchy communication.
The campaigns attracted wide-spread support from medical professionals, health authorities and civil society in developing countries. So in 1981, the UN World Health Assembly (the governing body of the World Health Organisation) recommended the adoption of an international code of conduct to govern the promotion and sale of breast milk substitutes. Global regulation of consumer industries was – and remains – a threat to business. UN resolutions are ""soft law"" that have little direct effect, yet often lead to hard national enforcement.
Back then, Nestlé's response was that their critics should focus on doing something to improve unsafe water supplies, which contributed to the health problems associated with bottle feeding. I spent 30 years doing just that in Mozambique, South Africa and elsewhere. So it was appropriate that water brought me together with Brabeck.
I don't like the way companies such as Nestlé promote bottled water, turning one of life's essentials into a brand that only the better-off can afford and undermining the value of public supplies in the process. But I have to acknowledge Brabeck's efforts to get business and governments to work together to manage and protect the world's vital water resources.
However, for Nestlé and the rest of the global food industry, the baby milk scandal has grown up rather than gone away. The industry today stands accused of harming the health of whole nations, not just their babies. New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has committed his own money to a campaign against unhealthy food, comparing this to his fight against the tobacco industry. The WHO faces opposition to proposals from the NGO Global Action for Improved Nutitrion to establish partnerships with industry. What started as skirmish in the nursery is turning into full-scale war on many fronts.
While the diseases are now obesity, diabetes and heart disease, the issues about the food industry's responsibility remain the same: its huge marketing budgets clearly influence peoples' behaviour, even if direct causality can't be demonstrated. Children and young adults may get fat because they do not get enough exercise. But if they are offered and encouraged to ""choose"" super-saturated fat diets, dosed with excessive salt and drinks laced with multiple sugars, can the industries that produce and promote those products absolve themselves from the ugly outcomes? Back in the 1970s, the Swiss judge ruled to the contrary. Today public and political opinion is again swinging in that direction.
Important questions are being raised in discussions about the new global development goals to be adopted when the UN's current Millennium Development Goals 'expire' in 2015. Should sustainable development goals focus on the unsustainable and unhealthy lifestyles of the rich as well as on the plight and basic needs of the poor? As the world searches for better measures of development than gross domestic product (GDP), counting dead babies remains an important indicator. But if infant mortality was a stark indicator of poor infant feeding practices in the 1970s, gross obesity is a parallel indicator of poor nutrition today. And action to control the products and marketing of large food companies are an obvious means to improve people's health.
So the spectre of global regulation still looms, an existential issue for the global food companies. ""Ethical investors"" now turn for guidance to the FTSE 4 Good index, which screens company behaviour. But there will need to be more explicit codes of practice and the political will to enforce them if shareholder action is to be effective. If global companies are to produce and promote healthier food and treat their suppliers more fairly and remain market leaders, such standards must also be enforced or cheap unregulated competition will inevitably undermine those who comply.
Critics of the global food business also face challenges. Realists know that a return to a bucolic world of trusted small-scale local food production cannot meet the needs of seven billion people today and more tomorrow. But should activists build on existing regulatory platforms by raising the bar, setting new standards and mobilising shareholders to promote a more responsible and accountable global food industry? Or should they take a more aggressive approach to monitoring and acting directly against damaging behaviour? We will probably see a mix of both strategies, making the food business a challenging place to be over the next few years.
Back in Davos, my dedication to Brabeck was simple. Reading the Baby Killer report today showed that we had made progress since the 1970s, I said. I thanked him for his support on the global water agenda, and I meant it. Of course there are many places around the world where Nestlé's operations are challenged by workers and communities, for many valid reasons. But in an imperfect world, at least some of the immediate issues are now on the table for public discussion and he has helped to put them there. I could perhaps have added the Mozambican adaptation of that old revolutionary slogan: ""Victory continues – the struggle is certain"". But, however accurate, that would have spoilt the moment.

Reporters have unveiled some 13.4 million secret documents detailing evidence of tax avoidance among high-ranking politicians and the super wealthy. Some in US President Donald Trump's cabinet have been implicated.
Some 400 reporters from 67 countries have scoured 13.4 million secret documents and uncovered tax-avoidance techniques used by the super rich and high-ranking politicians, German media reported on Sunday.
The leaked data was obtained by German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which said that the majority of the documents stem from offshore law firm Appleby, which was founded in Bermuda but has offices in several other locations. The company reported last month that it had been hacked.

The documents also show that by using shell companies, corporations such as Nike, Apple, Uber and Facebook are able to shrink their taxes to low rates.
Rock star Bono, as well as British Queen Elizabeth II's private estate, has also been involved in offshore funds, Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.
Over 120 politicians from 47 countries are involved in the tax-avoidance schemes, the paper reported.
Economist Gabriel Zucman told the Süddeutsche Zeitung that the global elite have parked an estimated 7.9 trillion euros ($9.1 trillion) in offshore tax havens.
The data was published by a number of news organizations in cooperation with the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).

German ex-chancellor implicated
Data from the Paradise Papers shows that former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder had a management role at an offshore company.
In 2009, he was part of a so-called ""independent supervisory board"" of the Russian-British energy company TNK-BP, the documents show. The joint venture by Britain's BP and Russia's Alfa-Group was based, like many other oil joint-ventures, in the British Virgin Islands.

Appleby declined to offer their services due to a conflict of interest with another client.

In December 2011, Schröder stepped down from his post on the board. In 2013, TNK-PB was taken over by Russian oil giant Rosneft — Schröder was appointed chairman of Rosneft's supervisory board a few weeks ago.
Several German companies also had dealings with Appleby, including car rental service Sixt, Deutsche Post (DHL), Siemens, Allianz and Deutsche Bank.
Panama Papers — the sequel
The Süddeutsche Zeitung was also involved in exposing the so-called Panama Papers leak last year.
The papers were initially leaked to the Süddeutsche Zeitung last year. The Panama Papers consist of some 11.5 million leaked documents implicating individuals stashing their wealth in offshore tax havens.
The documents revealed how Mossack Fonseca had created some 200,000 shell companies and listed the names of individuals, including politicians, celebrities and athletes, who had hidden their wealth in those companies."ÿÿParadise Papers expose tax schemes of global elite | DW | 05.11.2017

The European commission has opened an investigation into the tax treatment of Nike in the Netherlands, saying it may have given the US sportswear maker an illegal advantage.
The commission said in a statement that Dutch authorities had issued five tax rulings from 2006 to 2015, two of which were still in force, endorsing a method to calculate the royalty payments to two Nike entities based in the Netherlands.
The executive body, which oversees competition policy in the 28-member European Union, said it was concerned that the royalty payments endorsed by the rulings “may not reflect economic reality”.
It confirmed that it had intensified its investigation following allegations arising from the Paradise Papers, an investigation into tax avoidance published by the Guardian as part of a global collaboration of news organisations led by the ICIJ in Washington.
“The commission had already received some information on these rulings in the course of its overall investigation on tax rulings practices in all member states before the Paradise Papers were leaked,” a commission spokesperson said.
“Following the Paradise Papers allegations, the commission intensified its investigation and requested additional information from the Netherlands, which led to the doubts the commission is expressing in its opening decision of today.”
The commission has pushed governments to tighten taxation rules in response to revelations in the so-called LuxLeaks and the Panama and Paradise Papers, but some countries have resisted EU-wide changes.
The Nike case, announced on Thursday, follows other investigations by the EU executive since 2013 into tax schemes in Belgium, Gibraltar, Luxembourg, Ireland and the Netherlands that it says allow companies to establish structures to reduce their taxes unfairly.
The countries have been ordered to recover the tax from beneficiaries of such schemes, which have included Amazon, Apple, Starbucks and Fiat.
“Member states should not allow companies to set up complex structures that unduly reduce their taxable profits and give them an unfair advantage over competitors,” the EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement.
Nike said it was subject to and ensured that it complied with all the same tax laws as other companies operating in the Netherlands.
“We believe the European commission’s investigation is without merit,” a Nike spokesperson said.
The Dutch finance ministry said it would cooperate with the commission’s investigation and said that it agreed tax rulings should provide certainty and not preferential treatment.
Vestager did say she welcomed actions taken by the Netherlands to reform its corporate taxation rules and to help to ensure that companies operate on a level playing field.
The commission said its new investigation concerned the tax treatment of two Nike companies based in the Netherlands – Nike European Operations Netherlands BV and Converse Netherlands BV – which market and record sales for the US sportswear retailer’s operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
They received licences to use intellectual property rights of Nike and Converse products in the region in return for tax-deductible royalty payments to two other Nike entities also based in the Netherlands, but not taxable there.
The commission said the royalty payments appeared higher than what independent companies would have agreed between themselves. As a result, the Netherlands may have allowed the Nike companies to pay a lower amount of tax. If this was confirmed, it would amount to illegal state aid."ÿÿEU investigates Nike's tax status in the Netherlands

Five days before Christmas 2006, Nike chief executive Mark Parker was in an upbeat mood on a conference call with Wall Street analysts.
“So, how are we doing?” he asked himself out loud, almost a year since his promotion to the job. “In a word, I would say ‘good.’ ”
He reeled off a list of recent achievements, including a brief mention of “a more favorable long-term tax agreement in Europe,” according to a transcript of the call. This had, he said, “secured a big advantage.”
An advantage over whom or what? How big? What did this favorable agreement entail? These were all questions the analysts did not ask. The mechanics of tax avoidance are rarely scrutinized on such calls despite the enormous earnings boost they can provide – and the damage they can do to national treasuries.
Behind the scenes, authorities in the Netherlands had effectively given Nike the green light for a 10-year tax-avoidance arrangement that would allow the sportswear-maker to shift billions of dollars in profits from Europe to the tax haven of Bermuda.
Nike’s tax burden hasn’t been the same since. In the three years after that conference call, its after-tax profits would jump by an astounding 55 percent, to $1.88 billion, thanks in substantial part to a drop in its worldwide effective tax rate from 34.9 percent to 24.8 percent – on its way to 13.2 percent last year.
Evolving tax strategies
Nike’s tax planning over the years exemplifies how adept multinationals can be at staying ahead of the game. By building cross-border structures of interconnected companies that trade with one another, global businesses are often able to find ways of unlocking tax savings that no lawmaker intended them to receive. In many instances, these structures have no purpose other than to push global profits into offshore tax havens or into companies that are, for tax purposes, based nowhere at all.
Vital to Nike’s new arrangement was a Bermudan subsidiary, Nike International Ltd. Through it, the sportswear-maker held ownership of its iconic Swoosh design, together with other prized trademarks, for markets outside the United States.
The Bermudan subsidiary was able to charge trademark royalty fees to Nike’s European headquarters, in the Dutch town of Hilversum, which was selling sneakers and other sportswear to thousands of independent wholesalers and retailers as well as directly to customers through Nike’s own stores across Europe.
The royalty fees shifted billions in profits away from Europe, where they would otherwise have been taxed, and salted them away about 3,680 miles across the sea in tax-free Bermuda – where, the leaked documents reveal, Nike has no staff or offices but merely a few documents on file at the Bermudan corporate registry and at Appleby, a legal and corporate services firm.
The ICIJ, Süddeutsche Zeitung and more than 90 other media partners, have been analyzing about 6.8 million leaked documents, the Paradise Papers, from the internal files of offshore law firm Appleby Global and corporate services provider Estera, two businesses that operated together under the Appleby name until Estera became independent in 2016. Together with other documents and test purchases made across Europe, the leaked files reveal how Nike’s tax-avoidance structure worked.
Internal Appleby files show how much of Nike International’s affairs were run by senior executives, lawyers and accountants at Nike’s headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. A duplicate of Nike International’s official seal – a stamp used to execute documents in significant transactions – was kept in Beaverton.
Nevertheless, for tax purposes, Nike International remained firmly Bermudan.
For years, enormous royalty payments to Bermuda went unmentioned in the accounts of Nike’s Dutch subsidiaries. The first clue as to the amount of money flowing offshore came last year when Nike made limited disclosures in a largely unrelated case in U.S. Tax Court. Court submissions included brief mention of royalty payments to Bermuda in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Together, they totaled $3.86 billion.
The flow of trademark royalties had helped Nike build a $6.6 billion pile of offshore profits by June 2014. This sum had been taxed at just 3 percent outside the United States. And because it remained offshore, it had yielded no U.S. tax at all.
Presented with questions about this tax arrangement, Nike responded only with this statement: “Nike fully complies with tax regulations.”
The Netherlands Neverland
In 2014, the generous 10-year deal that Nike received from Dutch tax authorities was about to expire. But Nike and its advisers, including the U.S. law firm Baker McKenzie, came up with a solution. With only a few adjustments, they realized, trademark payments could continue to flow out of Nike’s European headquarters with little or no tax.
After a reorganization of Nike’s tax-avoidance structure in 2014, its operations in Hilversum made royalty payments of $982 million in 2015 and $1.13 billion in 2016, company accounts show.
Under the revised structure, the Swoosh and other trademarks had been transferred from the Bermuda subsidiary to a new Dutch subsidiary, Nike Innovate CV.
The initials “CV” appear repeatedly in the leaked Appleby and Estera records, offering a glimpse at one of the most secretive and effective components in tax-avoidance strategies.
The Netherlands’ CV – which stands for “commanditaire vennootschap,” or limited partnership – is born out of legislation dating back to the 1830s. In recent times, it has proved popular with multinationals because, if set up carefully, it can escape Dutch taxes and taxes elsewhere, too.
In effect, a CV that is owned by partners outside the Netherlands can be entirely stateless, and as a result taxless. Many U.S. multinationals, therefore, set up non-Dutch holding companies that agree to form Dutch CVs.
This is how it works: Under the Dutch law, profits made through a CV are regarded as if they were made by the partners. As such, these earnings have been made outside the Netherlands and cannot be taxed there. Other countries, meanwhile, see the picture differently. They see Dutch CVs as much like regular companies and regard the taxing rights as belonging to the Dutch.
In tax-avoidance circles, this confusion is much sought after and is known as a “hybrid mismatch.”
According to an analysis of U.S. balance-of-payments data by Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, almost one in six dollars of foreign profit made by American multinationals last year was made – on paper at least – through Dutch subsidiaries.
The ICIJ reviewed stock market filings for America’s 500 largest publicly traded multinationals, using data available in June 2017 and found 214 subsidiaries that were formed as Dutch CVs. Nike currently has 11 CV subsidiaries.
Regulators playing catch-up
Despite initial resistance from the Netherlands, the European Union this year adopted a directive requiring member states to tighten their tax laws to combat the most aggressive avoidance structures – including those involving CVs – by 2022 at the latest.
The Dutch Ministry of Finance said it expected to publish draft legislation next year with a view to having the news rules become effective at the start of 2020.
In late 2016, the ministry had urged other EU member states to delay reforms because of the heavy toll they were likely to take on the Netherlands, where the government estimates that 77,660 jobs are linked to U.S. multinationals that have been drawn there by the possibility of developing tax structures using CVs.
“The loss of the advantages provided by this structure would make the Netherlands less attractive to the American multinationals who use it,” the ministry told the ICIJ in a statement.
“Without simultaneous changes in tax rates, jobs may be lost as companies relocated their head office functions to alternative locations where they can set up a hybrid mismatch structure or to low-tax countries.”
Despite the likelihood of new legislation to curb the use of CVs in tax planning, it has remained popular with U.S. multinationals.
Ride-hailing app provider Uber has set up a Dutch CV with the help of Appleby, as has data-storage group NetApp. For 2014 and 2015, NetApp’s CV made royalty profits of $1.1 billion, on which it paid no tax.
In the last two years, Tesla has asked Appleby’s office on the Isle of Man – a tax haven about 5,100 miles from its headquarters in Palo Alto, California – to take minutes at meetings for its new CV.
Asked whether these meetings were taking place in the Isle of Man, whether Tesla’s CV held rights to any of the carmaker’s valuable intangible property and where the CV filed tax returns, Tesla declined to comment specifically. Instead, a spokesperson said in a statement: “Not only are we fully compliant with the law, but Tesla has not realized any tax benefit from [its CV].”
NetApp declined to comment, as did Uber, which has yet to realize a benefit from its tax structure as it spends profits on expansion.
Asked whether Nike Innovate CV files tax returns in any country or whether it is in fact stateless, Nike declined to comment.
In a statement, Nike said, “We rigorously ensure our tax filings are fully aligned with how we run our business, the investments we make and the jobs we create.”
Since switching property rights to the Swoosh and other trademarks from the Bermuda subsidiary to the Dutch partnership in 2014, Nike’s pile of offshore profits has continued to grow. At the end of May 2017, it had reached $12.2 billion. These accumulated earnings have been taxed at less than 2 percent by foreign tax authorities – and not at all in the United States.
Meanwhile, Parker, the Nike CEO, has also continued to prosper. For the last six years, he received compensation worth a total of nearly $144 million, in part for increasing profits and keeping taxes down. The chair of the compensation committee that sets Parker’s pay is Apple chief executive Tim Cook, whose company has been similarly aggressive in reducing taxes.
On his conference call to Wall Street at the end of September 2017, Parker once again sounded optimistic. “We’re very bullish on what’s coming down the pipeline,” he said.
And once again, Wall Street analysts were told that Nike had revised downward its forecast for the multinational’s effective tax rate.
Three months earlier, Nike had predicted finishing its financial year in May 2018 with a rate between 16 and 18 percent. Since then, executives explained, expectations had altered. The new likely range was 15 to 17 percent."ÿÿNike Stays Ahead Of The Regulators - ICIJ

Update: Georgetown University agreed to not renew its contract unless Nike signs compliance agreement.
Dive Brief:
* Recent reports of poor working conditions at a Nike contractor near Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam spurred 17 students to occupy Georgetown University President John DeGoia's office with demands the university not renew its contract with the apparel supplier., * The demands follow a year-long movement by solidarity advocates, student athletes and various universities demanding Nike comply with university codes of conduct and produce with an eye to just labor conditions., * Nike is the only university contract that does not comply with Georgetown's code of conduct, according to The Hoya — despite being one of the university's closest corporate partners. Nike has produced Georgetown's basketball jerseys since 1985, student-athletes wear Air Jordan brand shoes and former Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson Jr. sits on Nike's Board of Directors.,
Dive Insight:
The activism at Georgetown University shows human rights abuses in the supply chain are a touch point for consumers, the perceived importance of supplier codes of conduct, and the web of insufficient audits, enabling companies the be able to hide workforce abuse.
""None of us are going to stand to allow clothing in our school store, clothing that's worn by our athletes to be made by people in 90 plus degree factory heat, in a factory where workers face harassment, in a factory where workers face forced overtime,"" Georgetown University student Dan Zager told Supply Chain Dive. ""It's a shame, and it's an embarrassment of the university that upholds such high morals and Jesuit values would be willing to perpetuate this kind of violence and injustice.""
The yearlong pressure on Georgetown University by students and its Licensing and Oversight Committee began in October, 2015, when a worker strike at Hansae Viet Nam, Nike's contractor producing university apparel, revealed the widespread abuses.
At that time, workers' rights advocates demanded that Nike sign the university code of conduct for suppliers, which would subject Nike to oversight by the university's preferred auditor - the Worker Rights Consortium. The company has yet to comply with these demands, but half a year and numerous protests later, Georgetown's president intervened via letter. Last May, Nike allowed WRC access to Hansen Vietnam without signing the code of conduct.
The results of the audit were released Tuesday, and on Wednesday students organized a sit-in with a new demand: the company should cut the contract and renegotiate it to allow the WRC full access to Nike supplier factories.
""Fourteen months ago we were open to collaboration with Nike, but the past year plus has shown that Nike is not willing to bargain in good faith with the university."" Zager added. ""We are demanding that Nike facilitate timely and independent access to WRC to all of its supplier factories. We want to make clear that it's not just a Hansae problem, it's a Nike problem.""
Students at Georgetown University were still occupying the president's office as of 8 AM today, according to Zager. Hansae Viet Nam employs 9197 workers, 80% of which are female.
Nike's preferred auditor is the Fair Labor Association, which has previously audited Apple's plants, among others, and has been accused of being too easy on companies. Independent watchdogs have also revealed hidden violations at Uniqlo, Marks & Spencer, and Australia's fruit supply chains, despite company audits assuring labor compliance.
""Brand and retailer audits never identified and never corrected most of the serious labor rights violations taking place at Hansae,"" the WRC wrote in its report. ""Instead, these were not uncovered until the WRC launched its investigation in October of 2015. It is hard to imagine a clearer illustration of the importance of universities’ ongoing efforts to independently monitor licensees’ labor practices."""ÿÿStudents demand Georgetown University cut Nike contract amid reports of supply chain abuses

An Open Letter to Concerned Americans, Nike Shareholders and Consumers
Enclosed you will find our report on Nike labor practices in Vietnam and Nike's own corporate statements and promises. This report is the result of several months of research as well as interviews with 35 Vietnamese workers from Nike factories in Vietnam. Please do compare what Nike said to the reality of Nike workers in Vietnam. We, then, urge you to send the enclosed letters. The first letter is for President Clinton urging him to ask Nike to provide monetary compensation to workers in Vietnam who are owed backpay. The second letter is for Nikes CEO, Mr. Phil Knight, asking Nike to:
2. Adopt a fair living wage practice for all workers, one that would enable workers to meet basic needs, as well as save for the future. Nike can use independent studies by academics and NGOs to determine living wage standards.
3. Promote conditions at Nike factories conducive to the empowerment of workers. Stop Nike subcontractors from using boot camp techniques in managing factory workers. Adopt a corporate goal of having no tolerance for physical abuse, humiliation, corporal punishment as well as sexual abuse in Nike factories.
4. If Nike agreed with our findings concerning issues related to its violation of Vietnamese minimum wage law, then Nike should provide some forms of backpay to its Vietnamese factory workers to compensate for lost wages that Nike factory workers have endured.
5. Nike should forced all its factories in Vietnam to comply to the recommendations of the HCM City Health department and Bien Hoa Health Department.
Nike is a consumer oriented company and will respond to public pressure. Therefore, your letters to President Clinton and to Mr. Knight will make a big difference in this effort to improve the daily living conditions of Nike factory workers in Vietnam, China and Indonesia. Thank you very much for your help.

Exhibit 1-22
This report is the result of a six month effort by Vietnam Labor Watch (VLW) to understand the working conditions of workers at factories in Vietnam that make Nike products. The effort was started in October 1996, after the CBS News program 48 Hours ran a segment detailing the abuse of Nike workers in Vietnam. A group of Vietnamese Americans, deeply disturbed by the report, decided to contact labor groups and journalists in Vietnam to verify the report, to meet with Nike officials to discuss the problems and to organize a group called Vietnam Labor Watch to monitor the issue on an ongoing basis.
From March 2-18, 1997, at the invitation of Nike, Vietnam Labor Watch traveled to Vietnam to visit the factories. We met with workers, shoe manufacturing executives, labor union officials, union representatives, legal experts and foreign investment experts in Vietnam. In addition to the official factory tour of the Sam Yang plant, we did surprise visits to Sam Yang and three other plants that produce Nike shoes Pouchen, Dona Victor and Tae Kwan Vina. We conducted in-depth interviews with 35 Nike shoe factory workers outside their respective factories.
This study covers the following issues: labor law violations, wage, working conditions, health and safety practices, and sexual harassment. The study also compares what Nike told the American consumers about its labor practices versus what VLW has found in Vietnam.
We are glad that Nike is providing needed jobs in Vietnam, but we are deeply concerned about the companys labor practices. Nike contractors are exploiting the Vietnamese workers in many areas, including wages, working conditions, health and safety practices. Nike has a fine Code of Conduct but this Code of Conduct is being violated consistently by Nike contractors in Vietnam. While Nike claims it is trying to monitor and enforce its Code, its current approach to monitoring and enforcement is simply not working.
A simple story illustrates this fundamental problem. On the day we made an official visit with Nike representatives to the Sam Yang plant in Ho Chi Minh City, we found that the doors to the six factories of this facility were wide open, as stipulated in the fire codes. However, on the day, we made a surprise visit to the same facility, we found three factories had their doors closed, while workers were still working inside. A small industrial fire in any of these factories could easily lead to the loss of many lives.
Under the current system, Nike has no way to ensure that its contractors abide by its Code of Conduct. There are not enough Nike expatriates or employees in all of Nikes various departments in Vietnam to ensure that Nike contractors are complying with the code of conduct on a day-to-day, shift-to-shift basis. Auditing is also not adequate. Any visit, audit or study to find out about working conditions through worker interviews within the confines of the factory will simply be inaccurate. The workers are under a constant threat of retaliation and would not reveal their true feelings to anyone while they are inside the factory. To be accurate, any study or audit must interview workers outside the factory and must be done by a neutral party who could guarantee the anonymity of the workers.
We found that Nike subcontractors violated many critical Vietnamese labor regulations. We found violations of the laws covering overtime wages, night shift wages, and Sunday wages. We were shown pay stubs with such irregularities in compensation that they suggest a systematic form of wage cheating. We found many workers who received below minimum wage during the first three months of employment, which is another violation of Vietnamese law. We also found that in 1996, many workers worked over the legal maximum of 200 hours of overtime per year. In 1997, we already found several workers working such long hours of overtime that they were reaching the yearly limit within the first two months of 1997!
Over 90 percent of the Nike workers in Vietnam are women, and most of them are between the ages of 15 and 28. A uniform complaint among the women we interviewed was that they were not being paid a livable wage. The daily wage is approximately $1.60 and the cost of three simple meals is $2.10 per day. The women told us that they literally have to make a daily choice between eating a balanced meal or paying rent for the single rooms that most of them rent out. Ninety percent of the workers we interviewed told us that they received extra help in terms of finance, food, or housing from their families to make ends meet. Most of the women are from the countryside, and all the women we interviewed told us that they cannot afford to save money to send back home to their families.
The treatment of workers by the factory managers is a constant source of humiliation. We found that verbal abuse and sexual harassment are frequent, and corporal punishment is often used. During our two week visit, 56 women workers at a Nike factory were forced to run around the factorys premise because they werent wearing regulation shoes. Twelve of them suffered shock symptoms, fainted during the run and were taken to the hospital. This deplorable event occurred on International Womens Day, an important holiday when Vietnam honors its women. This abuse of workers reflects Nikes inability to enforce its Code of Conduct. It took place during a period when Nike knew that Vietnam Labor Watch was in Vietnam investigating Nike labor practices. During this same two week period, the workers at another Nike factory conducted two work stoppages, one of which lasted for three days.
Several factory rules in place violate sensibilities and indeed, human dignity. Workers cannot go to the bathroom more than once per 8-hour shift and they cannot drink water more than twice per shift. Forced and excessive overtime to meet high quotas is currently the norm at Nike factories. During January 1997, we found workers who worked over 80 hours of overtime, and in February, which was a short month due to the national four-day holiday for Lunar New Year, they were forced to work over 70 hours of overtime.
Many health and safety standards in Vietnam are ignored by Nike factories. In March 1997, we found that a Nike factory had not even implemented a single health and safety recommendation from a list of many made in September 1996 by the Ho Chi Minh City Health Department. It is a common occurrence to have several workers faint from exhaustion, heat and poor nutrition during their shifts. We were told that several workers even coughed up blood before fainting. The medical facilities at the factories we visited were inadequate. The Sam Yangs medical facility is only staffed with two nurses for approximately 6000 employees. There is only one doctor who works for two hours a day, even though this factory operates 20 hours per day.
Given the distressing conditions, the relationship between factory managers and worker is extremely tense. We believe if this antagonistic relationship continued, there could well be very serious clashes.
VLW believes that Nike can only enforce its code of conducts for its factories through the use of monetary fine and independent monitoring. Nike needs to adopt a policy of zero-tolerance for corporal punishment and physical abuse of its workers just as it has a policy of zero tolerance for poor quality shoes. Nike can only improve the working conditions at Nike factories in Vietnam by working with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor and the labor union representatives at the factories. Nike also needs to consult with other shoe manufacturers in Vietnam who have managed to produce high quality shoes for other US shoe companies while providing higher wages and offering much better working environment than Nike factories in Vietnam.
Nike Claims:
1. In the Nike Production Primer, Nike stated that workers in its factories in Vietnam ""can earn triple the wage offered in state-run factories"" (p. 2.8)
2. The first rule of Nike's code of conduct is that ""(Subcontractor/supplier) certifies compliance with all applicable local government regulations regarding minimum wage. overtime. child labor laws""
Reality:
* Vietnam Labor Watch has obtained actual pay stubs from 1996 and 1997 that confirm CBS News report that Nike violates Vietnamese laws in regards to minimum wage and forced overtime. In addition, we found that Nike has violated the training wage provision of Vietnamese labor law., * CBS news program 48 Hours reported that workers at Nike shoe manufacturing plants in Vietnam made an average of 20 cents per hour. Team leaders were making $42 per month, which is less than the Vietnamese minimum wage of $45 per month. Regular workers made even less. CBS documented this through interviews with team leaders and even showed a copy of a labor contract in its broadcast., * We also have obtained pay stubs (exhibit 1 & 2) in which a full-time worker received less than $27 for March and April 1996. the minimum wage in Vietnam at that time was $35. While Nike claims that this practice has ended, we found pay stubs of other workers who received less than $38 a month between November 1996 and February 97 (exhibit 3, 4, 5). the minimum wage in Vietnam since July 1996 is $45. All 35 workers from Nike factories in Vietnam that we interviewed confirmed that they received a wage lower than the minimum wage for a period of 90 days when they first started working at the factory. All 35 are not aware that this was a violation of the minimum wage law., * Article 69 of Vietnam's Labor Law stipulates that ""The labor user and the laborer may agree to work overtime, but not for more than four hours a day, 200 hours a year"". Several workers told CBS News that they are forced to work overtime to meet a daily quota that is set very high. We have found that on average Nike workers are forced to work 500+ hours of overtime per year., * The many irregularities we found in our analysis of pay stub records suggests a deliberate form of wage cheating. We also received complaints from workers about not getting the correct compensation for overtime wages, night shift wages or Sunday wages. According to Vietnamese labor law, the overtime wage is 1.5 times the regular wage, night shift wages should be 1.3 times, and Sunday and holiday wages should be twice the regular wage., * In conclusion, Nike factories violate many labor laws in Vietnam, including the provisions regarding minimum wage (Article 3 of Decree 198-CP of December 31, 1994, Section II. (1.) of Circular 11/LDTBXH-TT of May 03 1996), provisions regarding probationary period (Article 28 of the Labor Code and Article 5 (4.) of Decree 198-CP), in addition to the above-cited provision regarding the overtime limit.,
Nike Claims
1. Nike has agreed to ""only do business with partners whose workers are all cases employed voluntarily, not put at risk of physical harm, fairly compensated, and not exploited in any way."" (Athletic Footwear Association's Statement of Guidelines on Practices of Business Partners, signed by Nike, 3/93)
Reality
* The 35 workers we interviewed told us that they cannot live on the basic factory wage, which is the equivalent of $47US per month. It is simple math, they said. A simple, basic meal (like rice, vegetables and some tofu) costs 70 cents. three meals a day costs $2.10. They are paid about $1.60 per day. So the basic salary they receive from Nike factory jobs does not even cover the cost of food. Then there are other expenses: renting a room ($6 per month), clothing, soap, toothpaste etc. They also do not receive the full $47 wage, because there are deductions for health insurance, social insurance and meals from their paycheck., * All 35 workers told us that they receive some financial assistance to make ends meet from parents or relatives in terms of housing, money and food. They were surprised that the cost of living in Ho Chi Minh City is so much higher than in the rural areas where they came from and they were not prepared for city life., * All 35 workers we interviewed confirmed that they do not send any money home to their parents in the rural areas of Vietnam. They were quite surprised that we even asked such a question. They all felt that there is no way any of them could save enough money to send home unless they stopped eating for a couple of days per week., * How do they currently manage with the salary from Nike factory jobs? They skipped meals. When they eat, they only eat rice and vegetables. And a couple of times a month, they get help from their parents or relatives in terms of gifts such as money, rice, chicken, eggs and fish., * Thirty-two out of 35 workers we interviewed told us that they had lost weight since working at Nike factories. All reported not feeling good generally since working at the factories. They complained of frequent headaches as well as general fatigue., * The economic statistics released from the World Bank confirmed the reality facing these workers. The GDP for Ho Chi Minh City was $925 for 1995. Considering that Nike factory workers only make about $564 per year, it is not surprising that they are having trouble making ends meet.,

3. At the shareholder meeting on Sept 16, 1996, Nike CEO Phil Knight said about reports of physical abuse from Vietnam Nike factories (from transcript of Nike shareholders meeting),
We had a situation that got some publicity more in Asia maybe than in the United States, where we had a -- a stitching room floor lady, a Korean floor lady in -- in one of the Vietnamese factories, you know, hit a Vietnamese stitcher on the -- on the arm with an upper. And an incident was made out of that.
The -- The Korean floor lady was sent back to Korea and doesn't work in that factory anymore. It's basically an enforcement of our (quote) ""conduct.""
* We believe that the incidents of worker abuse found at Nike factories in Vietnam are not isolated incidents but are caused by the ""boot camp assembly line"" system in which workers are subjected to various forms of corporal punishment. Corporal punishment, including humiliation, is employed as a form of worker control by Nike contractors in Vietnam. This tactic is current employed in other Nike factories in Indonesia and Southern China. The ""boot camp assembly line"" is a method of controlling workers similar to those used in boot camps of military institutions to train new recruits. The only difference is that these young women have no idea that they were signing up for boot camp when they agreed to work for a Nike factory. Coming mostly from rural areas of Vietnam, they are not educated and are not familiar with their labor rights., * Fifteen Vietnamese women told CBS News and other Vietnamese newspapers that they were hit over the head by their supervisor for poor sewing at Nike Sam Yangs facility. two were later sent to the hospital. At Nikes Tae Kwan Vina facility, women were forced by their supervisors to kneel down with their hands up in the air for 25 minutes . A supervisor also taped the mouth of several workers for talking during work. Throughout 1996, we found many incidents of corporal punishment at Nike factories reported by Vietnamese newspapers, i.e. forcing workers to stand in the sun (sun-drying), writing down their mistakes over and over again like parochial school children, cleaning the toilet and sweeping factory floors.,
* Despite the many employees that Nike claims are at the factory sites in Vietnam, Mr. Knight did not present the correct information about these incidents to shareholders at the Nike shareholders meeting. If Mr. Knight had just consulted the Vietnamese newspapers, he would have had a more accurate picture. For example, the headline story in The Worker newspaper on March 31, 1996 proclaimed, ""Foreign Technician Strikes 15 Vietnamese Workers."" The same newspaper, on April 1, 1996, proclaimed: At Sam Yang Company, Cu Chi District, Ho Chi Minh City , Korean Technical Employee Strikes Many Vietnamese Female Workers. It went on to say that immediately after the incident took place, 970 workers on strike to protest the mistreatment of their fellow workers., * On Nov. 26, 1996, 100 workers at the Pouchen factory, a Nike facility in Dong Nai, were forced to stand in the sun for an hour over lunch because one worker had spilled a tray of fruit on an altar. After 18 minutes, one employee (Nguyen Minh Tri) refused to remain in the sun and walked away. he was then formally fired. Mr. Nguyen Minh Tri was reinstated after intervention by Nike management and the local labor federation officials. The three supervisors who abused the workers are still working at this factory. These supervisors must be severely reprimanded or fired (exhibit 20)., * The use of corporal punishment continued even during our Vietnam visit. On March 8, 1997, International Women Day, a supervisor at the Nike Pouchens facility in Dong Nai forced 56 women workers to run around the factory in the hot sun (exhibit 21). Eleven of them suffered shock symptoms and fainted, one became unconscious. All 12 were taken to the hospital by other factory workers. The Peoples Committee of Dong Nai has asked the police to hold the supervisor, Hsu Jui Yun, and to investigate the matter further. Vietnamese all over the country were outraged that on the International Womens Day, when most companies in Vietnam give women workers flowers and other gifts, 12 Vietnamese women were so abused that they have to spend the day in the emergency room., * Even with all the publicity about abuse of women workers at Nike factories, Nike has not put an end to the use of corporal punishment in its boot camp assembly lines. Therefore, we have no choice but to conclude that the current monitoring system is woefully inadequate. Just from examining the Nike departments in Vietnam, we could see that no matter how well intentioned these expatriates were, they could not be in all five factory facilities, which have eight to nine factories in each facility. These factories also run night shifts, a time when Nike expatriates are rarely present.,
* This method of boot camp assembly line creates an extremely tense atmosphere at the Nike factories. Strikes, work stoppages and work slowdown occur frequently. During a one week period, when Vietnam Labor Watch representatives were in Vietnam, one work stoppage occurred on 03/06/97 and another on 03/10/97. There were also several work slowdowns in February 1997 (exhibit 22). The reasons for these strikes or work stoppages are disputes about overtime pay, arbitrary firing of workers, and abusive treatment., * Verbal abuse is common. One worker recalled a story when a supervisor told the entire line how his dog in Korea could be trained better in one year than all the Vietnamese workers on the line. One worker, when asked how they were treated in Nike factories, said, ""They treat us like animals."", * Basic principles of human dignity are being violated at Nike factories. The workers we interviewed all complained about not being allowed to drink water more than twice per 8 hour shift or go to the bathroom more than once per shift. If they violate this rule, they are given a warning and after three warnings, they can be dismissed. Drinking water and using the toilet facility is controlled by a card or hat system. In order to use the facility, the supervisor must first assign a card or a hat to a worker. Wearing the hat or carrying the card, the worker is allowed to go. However, the number of cards or hats are limited per assembly line to 3 cards for 78-person line, 4 cards for a 300-person line., * Based on interviews with workers, Nike factory workers have no choice but to work overtime. If they refuse, they will be punished (using the various forms of corporal punishment that we have discussed earlier) or received a warning. After three warnings, theyll be fired. Only in a family emergency (major illness or death) are workers be allowed to skip the mandatory overtime., * The workers we interviewed are afraid of retaliation from Nike contractors if they are known to make complaints about the factory management. The workers told us that people are being fired without any reason and without the presence of their union representative. During the last strike at Sam Yang factory in October 1996, all mechanics were fired. Several workers were also fired and under pressure, were later hired back. During a work slowdown between March 10-12, 1997, the whole line was fired and then rehired., * The workers also told us that the factory management prepared the factory and warned the workers when there were visitors from the United States or Europe. Workers are too afraid of retaliation to express their true feelings to these visitors. During such a factory visit, workers are allowed to work slower and verbal abuse or other forms of corporal punishment do not occur. But when the visitors leave, things go back to the normal, miserable conditions. When VLW made a visit to a Nike facility in Ho Chi Minh City with a Nike representative, we found that the doors to all the factories were open, as stipulated by law. But on our subsequent, surprise visit to the same facility, several factories have their doors closed with workers inside, constituting a serious fire hazard., * Based on our experiences, we believe that any visit, study or audit using interviews of workers within the confines of the factory will not be accurate. To be valid, the worker interviews must be done outside the factory by people who can guarantee workers their anonymity.,
* Working in an environment with the threats of corporal punishment, fear of retaliation and excessive overtime is debilitating to the workers. Workers we interviewed complained about weight loss and general fatigue. In general, they are in poor health. We can easily see the reasons. Working on a Nike assembly line is a stressful job: workers must keep up an inhuman pace and on top of that they have to worry about potential corporal punishment or verbal abuse when they slow down. The hours are long: many factory workers work 11 hours a day, six days a week, and sometimes have to work on Sundays as well. Pay stub records reflect that it is common for workers to put in 40 to 50 hours of overtime per month. During February 1997 the month of the Lunar New Year, a major holiday in Vietnam when workers get 4 days off, we found pay stubs in which a worker worked over 70 hours of overtime (exhibit 19)., * Workers fainted often while working in Nike factories in Vietnam. About three incidents of fainting occur per day. The union representative told us that he witnessed one worker cough up blood and faint while working on the assembly line. All 35 workers we interviewed confirmed that at least once a week they saw or heard about someone who fainted while working in the factory. As to the reasons, they attributed them to stress, exhaustion, heat, the smell of chemical (glue, paint) in the factory as well as people not eating to save extra money., * We obtained a report dated September 9, 1996 from the Ho Chi Minh City Health Department which describes problems at Sam Yang, a Nike facility. The major problem is that many areas of the factory have a high concentration of toluene, reaching a level of 180 mg per sq. meter when the legal limit is 100 mg per sq. meter. The noise level in several area were found to be much higher than the legal limit. The report also provided many recommendations to ameliorate these problems. As of March 12, 1997, the Sam Yang factory management did not implement any of the recommendations in this report. We also found that the factory management ignore recommendations made by Nikes labor practice department, such as the recommendation that they leave factory doors open in case of fire., * The medical facility at the factories we visited were inadequate. The Sam Yang medical facility is only staffed with two nurses for about 6000 employees. There is only one doctor, who is available for only two hours a day, while this factory operates 20 hours a day. We were told that the factory management did not want to spend the money to hire a full-time doctor. Workers during the night shift complain about having to go to the hospital about 30 minutes away for medical emergencies such as electric shocks, loss of finger nails, or severe cuts in their hand and fingers.,

2. At the shareholder meeting on Sept 16, 1996, Nike CEO Phil Knight also commented on a report of sexual abuse at Nike factories in Vietnam. This is what Mr. Knight said (from transcript of Nike shareholders meeting),
Fairly recently in Vietnam, that basically there was a situation on the night shift where four of the woman th-- who were in the stitching fell asleep. And -- and the night watchman who again was Korean in coming through the room, two of them woke up and fled the room. And he shock the other two. And in the shaking of one of 'em, there was perhaps some misappropriate behavior. And then he touched a part that he should not have.
That basically she protested. And -- and basically, it comes about as close as you can get to sexual harassment in U.S. terms, as you can get. The night watchman was sent back to Korea. And - essentially, trying to rectify the situation. However, it was reported in one of the Vietnam -- at least one of the Vietnamese newspaper as a rape.
* A Nike plant supervisor fled Vietnam after he was accused of sexually molesting several women workers. The Nike expatriates who were at the factory daily did not try to make the supervisor stay in Vietnam to face criminal charges. The government of Vietnam later instigated extradition procedures against the supervisor., * Once again Nike CEO still did not have or did not present the correct information about these incidents to Nike shareholders. From The Worker newspaper, Nguoi Lao Dong, August 23, 1996.,
At 4:40 am on the morning of August 18, 1996, Kim Sung Rat went to inspect passing an area where there were four Vietnamese female workers working in the computer embroidery room. Kim Sung Rat let two of the workers take a break and called the other two female workers, NTH and NTVP, to come to the storage area at the farthest end of the factory where there was no one working, about 50 meters away from the computer room. Here Kim Sung Rat called NTVP into the storage area and made a gesture that she should take off her shirt. After that, Rat tore the shirt of P and felt her up. P ferociously resisted, and was able to run and escape.
At that moment Rat grabbed a hand and pulled H into the room. Again with a very obscene action, he rubbed her chest, pulls the pants zipper of H, and rubbed her private parts. After that, Rat made a sign by his finger in a very obscene manner indicating sexual intercourse. Although weaker than P, and being unable to escape nevertheless, H ferociously resisted. Being able to guess the activity or Rat in the storage room, as he had done with her, Miss P had run to call the guards, and R was caught in the act.
* There are many problems with Nike using its own expatriates to try to clean up problems in the factories. Besides not having the correct information, the on-site expatriates at the factories in Vietnam have not prevented the contractors from engaging in unethical and probably illegal behavior. Nike subcontractor, Taekwang Vina, has offered bribes to the two female workers, asking them to keep quiet. From The Worker newspaper, Nguoi Lao Dong - August 25, 1996 (excerpts of an interview with the victims),
Questioner: (to NTH) Can you tell us, after this took place, on the side of the company, what was their manner?
NTH. After this took place, the leadership of the company put forth their ""separate condition"" with me and P. The company agreed to compensate us in order to smooth over this matter. Two times they gave to me and to P, each of us, an envelope full of money in order to buy us off and smooth over the action of this expert Kim. But we refused. I answered them, we will not for money sell our dignity or our honor.
* Nike factory workers in Vietnam we interviewed all complained about frequent sexual harassment from foreign supervisors while working on the assembly line. In broad daylight, in front of other workers, these supervisors would try to touch, rub or grab the buttocks or chest areas of these women. Those women who are considered particularly good looking are frequent targets of sexual harassment. One supervisor even told a female factory worker that it is a common custom for Korean men to greet women they like by grabbing their behinds.,
For comparative purpose, we also interviewed 25 workers at two other shoe manufacturing companies in Vietnam: Thai Binh and Hiep Hung. Thai Binh is privately owned and Hiep Hung is a state enterprise. Both of these companies are currently producing shoes for Reebok, as well as other European shoe companies. Both are employing from 4000 to 6000 workers each. We found that the working conditions and even the wages are better than those found in Nike factories. The Thai Binh factory is in Song Be province, which has a lower minimum wage than Ho Chi Minh City. Yet the factory workers there receive a higher wage than those in Nike factories.
Just from a few visits, it is easy to see the difference in treatment of workers as soon as one walks into these factories. The workers smile at the guests. they are working but they are relaxed, while workers in Nike factories are tense, sheepishly looking at the guests. At Thai Binh and Hiep Hung factories, several workers started conversations with us when we walked through the factory floor. At Nike factories, the workers did not even want to sit next to us during lunch.
During lunch at Thai Binh, workers and managers all share the same table, talking and eating. At Nike factories, the managers have a separate dining room. At the end of the shift, one can also see another major difference in treatment of workers. At Thai Binh, the workers simply walked their bikes and packages out of the factory. At Nikes factory Sam Yang, the workers are searched if they carry any bags because the factory management does not trust its own employees .
In terms of wages, both of these Vietnamese shoe factories offered higher pay than Nike factories. Thai Binh, in Song Be district (a lower minimum wage than Ho Chi Minh), offered $52 US per month. At Hiep Hung, the entry level wage is $65 US per month.
* In the June '96 issue of Life Magazine, Sydney Schanberg (author of The Killing Fields) documented child labor being used in Pakistan in the production of Nike soccer balls -- for 60 cents a day., * The March 16 edition of the New York Times carried a story on union busting by Nike shoe contractors in Indonesia. One worker was ""locked in a room at the plant and interrogated for seven days by the military, which demanded to know more about his labor activities."", * The October 17 edition of the CBS program 48 Hours had a segment on Nike's labor rights abuses in Vietnam, including: beatings, sexual harassment and forcing workers to kneel for extended periods with their arms held in the air., * On November 3, an article by Australian labor scholar Anita Chan was published in the Washington Post. She described Chinese shoe factories -- producing for Nike and other companies -- where supervisors submit workers to a military boot camp style of control., * On March 14 1997, Reuters had a report on a Nike factory, Pouchen in Dong Nai, forced 56 Vietnamese women workers to run around the factorys premise, 12 fainted and were taken to the hospital emergency room.,
Vietnam Labor Watch firmly believes that a modern, high-tech shoe factory canand mustbe managed without practices that are exploitative and abusive to factory workers. Corporal punishment and severe disciplinary measures should not be necessary to produce high-quality shoes. Labor practices of the 19th century should no longer be tolerated at the end of the 20th century, especially by a U.S. corporation that claims the moral high ground, projects a progressive image, and is extremely wealthy.
We believe that Nike is willing to change its practices, and we also believe that Nike has the power to make its contractors rectify their labor practices. In a spirit of cooperation, so that we can improve the daily lives of the workers, we recommend that Nike take the following steps in Vietnam:
* Nike should abandon the practice of using training/probationary wages or paying the workers below minimum wage under the guise of providing technical/vocational training. Many Nike factory jobs do not qualify as technical vocations and the current Nike factories cannot be considered vocational schools. Using this approach to underpay Nike workers is illegal and unethical. Wages in Vietnam are already at rock bottom. There is no need for Nike to pay workers any lower than the $45 monthly minimum wage., * Nike should make the implementation of its Code of Conduct a top priority, putting it above even quality and cost. Once the situation improves, then Nike can shift this priority. Nike should demand that all managers who use corporal punishment or are guilty of sexual harassment be dismissed. Nike should make it the responsibility of the general manager of the factory to run a factory that respects its workers. After three violations of Nikes Code, the general manger should be dismissed. The current approach of having no specific punishment for violating the Code of Conduct generates the impression that the Code has no teeth., * Nike should levy a stiff monetary penalty on the contracting company whenever it violates the Code of Conduct. The current practice of not making the subcontracting company responsible for its managers treatment of workers will only encourage further violations. Companies tend to respond well to severe monetary fines. With so many repeated violations after only 18 months of operation in Vietnam, this is the only course of action left to demonstrate to outsiders that Nike is serious about enforcing its Code of Conduct., * Nike should immediately enforce the 60 hour work week specified in the Code. The current practice of excessive, forced overtime (sometimes over 70 hours per month) would be considered abusive by any standards., * Nike should be a good corporate citizen in Vietnam. Nike cannot assume that creating low paying jobs is good enough. Vietnamese workersand their supporters around the worldwill not simply be grateful for the jobs and ignore the deplorable labor practices in the factories. Moreover, it is unjust that Nike shareholders profit handsomely from the low wages paid these Vietnamese workers. Nike should take some of the profits it makes from Vietnamese workers and invest them in projects that help improve the lives of poor Vietnamese., * Nike should work directly with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor to hear the complaints from workers and to talk with workers outside the factory environment. We found that as long as the workers remain within the confines of the factory, they are very fearful and are not willing to talk about their conditions to anyone. The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor at both the local and district levels were very helpful to us in arranging meetings with factory workers outside factories. We believe that the Confederation could be an important addition to Nikes efforts to improve its labor practices., * Nike should consult with several Vietnamese who are experts in shoe factories and on how to establish better labor practices. Beside Nike factories, we had an opportunity to visit two other shoe factories in Vietnam: Thai Binh and Hiep Hung. Both are Vietnamese companies and both are producing high-quality shoes for Western shoe companies such as Reebok and Fila. The presidents of both of these companies have expressed their willingness to consult with Nike on how to treat its Vietnamese workers. Even though they consider Nike a competitor, both of these managers are willing to help because they want to improve the working conditions of the workers at the Nike factories. Their desire to help is sincere and generous, and we believe that Nike should take them up on their offer., * Nike should form an independent monitoring board in Vietnam consisting of representatives from neutral parties, including government labor officials, NGOs, and labor unions There are many excellent organizations, as well as respected individuals, who would be willing to serve on such a board., * Nike should immediately implement all of the recommendations made by Vietnams Health Department to improve the health and safety conditions at Nike factories., * Nike should implement all of the recommendations made by Ho Chi Minh Citys General Confederation of Labor, which include: classes on labor rights for workers, regular medical examination for workers, and establishing a pay scale that is fair and abides by Vietnamese labor law.,
Exhibit 1
Exhibit 2
Exhibits 1 & 2 combines together demonstrate that Nikes subcontractor, Samyang Vietnam Co., Ltd violated the minimum wage law of Vietnam. The minimum wage in Vietnam for the period of March and April 1996 is $35 USD or 387,000 dong (VND). These two exhibits demonstrate that this worker, employee no. 6032, received a wage 271,000 VND for 32 days. According to Vietnamese law, Nike subcontractor can pay a wage that is less than the minimum wage for a trial period of 6 days. Therefore, Nike factory definitely owed at least 26 days of backpay to this worker.
Additionally, Exhibit 1 shows that employee 6032 worked 4 hours of overtime for March 1996 and Exhibit 2 shows that the same employee worked 20 hours of overtime for April 1996.
Exhibit 3, 4 & 5 also demonstrate that Nikes subcontractor, Sam Yang Vietnam Co, Ltd. violated the minimum wage law of Vietnam for the month of November, December 1996 and February 1997. These three exhibits show that employee no 6111 received a wage of 387,000 VND for 3 months. VLW could not obtain a paystub for Jan 1997., nevertheless we can easily assume that this worker received the same wage as December 1996. The minimum wage in Vietnam since July 1996 is $45 USD.
Exhibit 3
Exhibit 3 demonstrates that in Nov. 1996, employee 6111 received a basic salary of 387,000 VND which is below the minimum wage of Vietnam ($45).
Exhibit 4
Exhibit 4 demonstrates that in Dec. 1996, employee 6111 received a basic salary of 387,000 VND which is below the minimum wage of Vietnam ($45 USD).
Exhibit 5
Exhibit 5 demonstrates that in Feb 1997, employee 6111 received a salary of 387,000 VND for 16 days of work which is below the minimum wage of Vietnam ($45 USD). There are other irregularities with this paystub. Please refer to exhibit 19 for explanation.
Exhibit 6
Exhibit 6 shows that employee 6032 worked 40 hours of overtime in May 1996.
Exhibit 7
Exhibit 7 shows that employee 6032 worked 36 hours of overtime in June 1996.
Exhibit 8
Exhibit 8 shows that employee 6032 worked 31 hours of overtime in July 1996.
Exhibit 9
Exhibit 9 shows that employee 6032 worked 53 hours of overtime in August 1996.
Exhibit 10
Exhibit 10 shows that employee 6032 worked 29 hours of overtime in September 1996.
Exhibit 11
Exhibit 11 shows that employee 6032 worked 21 hours of overtime in October 1996.
Exhibit 12
Exhibit 12-17 shows that employee 5101 worked 236.5 hours of overtime from May 1996 to October 1996. The Vietnamese legal limit of overtime is 200 hours per year.
Exhibit 13
Exhibit 13 shows that employee 5101 worked 36 hours of overtime in June 1996.
Exhibit 14
Exhibit 14 shows that employee 5101 worked 31 hours of overtime in July 1996.
Exhibit 15
Exhibit 15 shows that employee 5101 worked 55 hours of overtime in August 1996.
Exhibit 16
Exhibit 16 shows that employee 5101 worked 31 hours of overtime in September 1996.
Exhibit 17
Exhibit 17 shows that employee 5101 worked 39.5 hours of overtime in October 1996.
Exhibit 18
Exhibit 18 shows that employee 5101 worked 84 hours of overtime including 21 Sunday hours in Jan 1997
Exhibit 19
Exhibit 19 and exhibit 5 have many irregularities suggesting a systematic form of wage cheating. Both paystubs indicate that both employees worked 29 days in February 1997 but there were only 28 days in February 1997. If the workers have worked for the entire month of February, then they must have worked 4 Sundays, yet the paystubs indicate that they did not receive any Sunday pay (2 times the basic salary). If the workers have worked two shifts on some days, then the second shift should be compensated as overtime pay and not as night-shift pay. Overtime pay is higher, 1.5 times the basic salary, than night shift pay, 1.3 times the basic salary.
In February, there is a 4 day national holiday for the Lunar New Year. If the workers have worked during the holidays, they did not receive holiday pay which is 2 times the basic salary. The worker in exhibit 19 insisted that she got 4 days off for the Lunar New Year, and she worked at least 100 hours of overtime including several Sundays, and several days of double shifts. Exhibit 19 indicates that she only worked 73 hours of overtime.
Exhibit 18 and 19 together demonstrates that this one worker has already worked over 157 hours of overtime during the first two months of 1997. The maximum overtime limit for Vietnam is 200 hours per year. After two months in February 1997, this worker is reaching the legal maximum limit.

At Pouchen Company, Dong Nai, at mid-day 10/16 Lunar Calendar
3 Taiwanese technical experts punished about 100 employees by forcing them to stand in the sun during lunch
Exactly at 12 noon, 11/26/1996, during the process of punching lunch tickets, it was not sure who but someone accidentally spilled a tray on the altar to commemorate October 16th, Lunar calendar. No one admitted to the mistake, afraid of being fired, 3 Taiwanese technical experts: Hoang, Trinh and Ky forced the entire group of Vietnamese workers (approximately 100 workers of in the construction crew) to stand in the sun (sun-drying) for 20 minutes, including workers who were getting ready to eat lunch.
Refusing to accept this kind of humiliating punishment, after 17 minutes, Mr. Nguyen Minh Tri (a worker in the construction crew) expressed his objection to the indignity. Immediately Mr. Tri employee card was taken and he was fired at 3 pm.
The labor officials at Dong Nai is still trying to clarify the matter. PV

 Published September 20, 2019 by .  The Amazon rainforest is burning. Are your shoes, car seats, or sofa to blame?New research by Global Canopy confirms what PETA has been saying for decades: Raising cows for their skin and flesh is responsible for 80% of the deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. The group’s report exposes the link between Amazon deforestation and the leather industry, and you might be surprised by some of the companies that it names.© iStock.com/SPmemoryGlobal Canopy lists companies based in the U.S. or in Europe that import and sell a great deal of leather and could have suppliers that are contributing to deforestation.

U.S. meat companies import $295 million in Brazilian beef every year, making our country a major contributor to the death of the Amazon and to climate change.PETA billboards that have been placed outside the oldest U.S. leather tannery—the Horween Leather Company in Chicago—and near the Brazilian consulate in Los Angeles expose the link between the leather and beef industries and Amazon deforestation.We can—and we must—save the Amazon.

The Greek government has launched an official investigation into pharmaceutical giant Novartis, following the publication of allegations of corruption and bribery in national news media.
NGOs, however, indicate that the reported crimes are not isolated to Greece.
The Athens-Macedonian News Agency (ANA) reported on Tuesday (3 January) that corruption prosecutors raided the offices of Swiss drug maker Novartis in the Greek capital as part of an ongoing investigation over bribery allegations ordered by Greece’s supreme court.
According to media reports, two executives of Novartis in Greece had given the US government documents indicating that more than 4,000 private and public doctors were bribed in order to promote the company’s products and boost prescriptions.
American prosecutors have been investigating Novartis for over two years.
euractiv.com was informed that the products were innovative and expensive anti-cancer drugs.
According to Kathimerini, the company’s turnover in 2015 in Greece was only 0.35% of global sales of (€341 million), but US law allows Greece to intervene and fine the Swiss company over illegal corporate practices committed in the country.
State broadcaster ERT TV reported on Wednesday (4 January) agents from America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had arrived in Athens to provide assistance.
During the raid, the police confiscated computer hard disks and tablets, while prosecutors requested a thorough search to gather electronic data related to the probe.
Syriza lawmaker Marios Katsis warned that the investigation “may result in serious criminal responsibility for a number of persons”.
“There are people who were covering for many years this scandal and have every reason to fear,” he said.
Greek government sources underlined the need to shed light on the case, while Justice Minister Stavros Kontonis promised a “quick and thorough” investigation.
Suicide attempt
Meanwhile, further questions were raised after a Greek Novartis official, who was interviewed for the case, attempted suicide in a famous hotel in Athens on New Year’s Day.
The 44-year-old Novartis executive was taken in for questioning, and had asked to meet the Head of the Prosecution Against Corruption, Eleni Raikou, who is responsible for the Novartis case.
Novartis’ reaction
Contacted by EURACTIV, a Novartis spokesperson stated that the company was aware of media reports concerning its business practices in Greece and noted that it was actively seeking further information.
“We are fully cooperating with requests from local and foreign authorities [...] Novartis is committed to the highest standards of ethical business conduct and regulatory compliance in all aspects of its work and takes any allegation of misconduct extremely seriously,” the company emphasised.
EURACTIV also asked the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) for a comment, but we did not receive a reply in time for this article’s publication.
Novartis currently holds the Presidency of EFPIA.
Not a surprise
For Yannis Natsis, Policy Coordinator at the European Public Health Alliance, the bribery allegations do not come as a surprise and he doubts that this is a practice limited to Greece only.
“Should these be confirmed, they will prove that the pharma industry is once again abusing its excessive power to buy influence and shape patients’ behavior,” he told EURACTIV, stressing that it remains to be seen who was bribed aside from the doctors.
According to Natsis, the alleged bribes must have been “fruitful” for two reasons.
“First, although Greece could be described as a bankrupt country, numerous medicines with exorbitant prices particularly in oncology are still reimbursed whereas that is not the case in other wealthier EU member states,” he said. Doctors in Greece have systematically shied away from criticising the high prices demanded by the industry.
“The above are telling and point to how effective the bribes may have been,” Natsis added.
The Maltese Presidency
Medicines’ affordability and accessibility have been under discussion for the last seventeen months in the EU Council and will also take center stage in Malta’s EU Presidency, which began on 1 January.
EU health ministers took timid steps last June to address the rising price of medicines, recognising that in many cases, market failures prevented drugs from reaching patients in need of treatment (See background).
In a recent interview with EURACTIV, Maltese Health Minister Chris Fearne confirmed that the Council would like to see more transparency in the way that pharmaceutical companies negotiate with the national purchasing authorities.
At the moment, individual member states and national purchasing authorities are more or less not allowed to share the prices they get among themselves.
“I think this is keeping prices high and there is a move even within the different member states to start talking about how we can introduce measures to make negotiations more transparent, something that might bring prices down and therefore make medicines more accessible to patients,” Fearne noted."ÿÿNovartis under scrutiny for alleged pharma scandal in Greece

WASHINGTON – Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics Inc. and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation have agreed to pay $72.5 million to resolve civil False Claims Act allegations arising from the marketing of the cystic fibrosis drug TOBI, the Justice Department announced today. The settlement resolves allegations that, between Jan. 1, 2001 and July 31, 2006, Novartis and its predecessor, Chiron Corporation, caused false claims to be submitted to federal health care programs for certain off-label uses of the drug.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved TOBI, an inhaled antibiotic, for the treatment of certain cystic fibrosis patients. The United States alleges that Chiron, and then Novartis, marketed TOBI for unapproved uses, such as diseases other than cystic fibrosis, and for cystic fibrosis patients who did not meet the parameters of the FDA-approved indication and for which TOBI was not a medically accepted use. The government alleges that this conduct caused the submission of false claims to federal health care programs.
""Pharmaceutical companies must not promote their drugs for uses that have not been proven to be safe and effective,"" said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. ""We are committed to pursuing False Claims Act violations and recovering taxpayer dollars lost to off-label marketing.""
""This office is committed to safeguarding the federal health care programs against false claims caused by off-label marketing and other types of illegal conduct,"" said Joseph Russoniello, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California.
Under the agreement announced today, the proceeds from the settlement will be divided between the federal government and various states, with the United States receiving $43.5 million to resolve the federal claims, and the states receiving $29 million to settle their respective claims.
""The Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) is thoroughly committed to pursue any and all allegations of fraud that drain precious resources from America's war fighters,"" said Richard W. Gwin, Special Agent in Charge of the DCIS Western Field Office. ""This particular fraud was directly related to the healthcare of our brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and their families throughout the world. The settlement with Novartis was only made possible by the hard work of the prosecutors from the Department of Justice, agents from the DCIS and all the other joint investigative agencies.""
This settlement resolves a lawsuit brought by three former Chiron employees – Robert Lalley, Courtney Davis and William Manos – under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, which permit private individuals known as relators to bring a lawsuit on behalf of the United States and to share in any recovery. The relators will receive $7.825 million of the federal share of the settlement announced today.
This settlement is part of the government’s emphasis on combating health care fraud. One of the most powerful tools in that effort is the False Claims Act, which the Justice Department has used to recover approximately $2.3 billion since January 2009 in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs. The Justice Department’s total recoveries in False Claims Act cases since January 2009 have topped $3 billion.
The settlement was the result of a coordinated effort among the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California. the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. the Office of Personnel Management, Office of Inspector General, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, Office of Inspector General. the Defense Criminal Investigative Service. the Federal Bureau of Investigation. the FDA. and the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units."ÿÿNovartis Vaccines & Diagnostics to Pay More Than $72 Million to Resolve False Claims Act Allegations Concerning TOBI

Novartis' Japanese subsidiary was raided yesterday as part of an investigation into allegations of mis-promotion of its hypertension drug Diovan.
The Japanese authorities are looking into a complaint - filed by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in January - which alleges that Novartis advertising carried falsified data from trials that inflated the benefits of Diovan (valsartan).
If the allegations turn out to be true, the perpetrators face fines of up to 2 million yen (around $20,000) and up to two years in prison, according to local press reports. While the material impact to the company would therefore be light, it could damage Novartis' reputation in the world's second-largest pharma market.
News of the claimed data falsification first emerged last month and at the time Novartis strenuously denied the allegations, suggesting it was not involved in the research that is said to be flawed and unaware of any data manipulation.
It has remained tight-lipped on the latest development, limiting itself to saying it will cooperate with the Japanese authorities' investigation. Novartis has also been drawn into the ongoing probe into corruption by the pharmaceutical industry in China.
Diovan was the driver for Novartis' top-line growth in recent years, although it has since succumbed to patent expiration in most world markets, including Japan. Sales reached a peak of around $6bn in 2011 but fell to $3.5bn last year and are expected to decline further with the start of generic competition in the US this year.
Alzheimer's probeMeanwhile, the raid comes in the wake of another Japanese health ministry probe into data falsification. The MHLW is also investigating an anomaly in a $31m neuroimaging study involving Alzheimer's disease patients that was backed by 11 pharma companies, including Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Takeda Pharmaceutical and Astellas Pharma.
A Tokyo University professor is acting as a whistleblower in that case, claiming that researchers have manipulated data in the ongoing J-ADNI study and included patients not eligible for enrolment, according to Business Monitor."ÿÿNovartis under fire in Japan over Diovan promotion

The Swiss drug giant Novartis is paying $422.5 million to settle criminal and civil investigations into the marketing of the antiseizure medicine Trileptal and five other drugs, federal officials said on Thursday.
Federal prosecutors accused Novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to health care professionals through speaker programs, advisory boards, entertainment, travel and meals. But aside from pleading guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mislabeling in an agreement that Novartis announced in February, the company denied wrongdoing.
Novartis joins a growing list of pharmaceutical companies that have settled government investigations into health care fraud in the last few years, including Pfizer, which paid $2.3 billion. Eli Lilly, $1.4 billion. Allergan, $600 million. AstraZeneca, $520 million. Bristol-Myers Squibb, $515 million. and Forest Laboratories, $313 million. Pfizer, Lilly, Allergan and Forest pleaded guilty to crimes in the cases.
The settlement includes a $170 million criminal fine and $15 million in criminal forfeiture by Novartis Pharmaceuticals, its United States subsidiary. The plea was announced by the office of the United States attorney in Philadelphia, which has specialized in health care fraud investigations of companies that promote drugs for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, known as off-label marking.
“Off-label marketing can undermine the doctor-patient relationship and adversely influence the clear judgment that a doctor’s patients have come to rely on and trust,” said Zane David Memeger, the United States attorney.

Federal prosecutors said Novartis illegally promoted Trileptal for neuropathic pain and bipolar disease, singling out psychiatrists and pain specialists who were known to use the drug off-label. Physicians are legally permitted to use approved drugs for any purpose, but companies are prohibited from promoting them for conditions not authorized by the F.D.A.
Novartis settled the investigation into the other drugs for $237.5 million.
In a statement, Novartis said it had been cooperating with the investigations since 2005 and had already corrected its promotional practices. “We are pleased to have reached resolution on this matter,” said Andy Wyss, president of Novartis Pharmaceuticals. He added that the company would “continue its commitment to high standards of ethical business conduct and regulatory compliance in the sale and marketing of our products.”
Erik Gordon, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan school of business who follows the drug industry, said it was “easy to stifle a chuckle” when the company announced a guilty plea and, in the same news release, promised to continue ethical conduct.

Prosecutors said top management at Novartis had approved illegal marketing from July 2000 to June 2004. No individual, however, was named or charged. Four whistle-blowers in the case will share more than $25 million under a government program intended to encourage company insiders to report illegal activity.
Ruth R. Faden, a professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins and executive director of its Berman Institute of Bioethics, said off-label marketing undermined the government’s work to ensure the safety of drugs.
“When drugs are in the market, they can be used for any indication at the discretion of the physician,” she said. “But that’s different from a situation in which companies make aggressive efforts to persuade physicians that there’s value in a drug for which there is no evidence.”
Novartis stock fell by about 1 percent an hour before the 1 p.m. announcement and closed at $57.67, down 0.53 percent.
The five other drugs involved in the civil settlement are Diovan, a hypertension drug that is the company’s top-selling product, at $6 billion last year. Sandostatin, a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder that had worldwide sales of $1.2 billion last year. Exforge, a hypertension drug that sold $671 million. Tekturna, a blood pressure medicine that sold $290 million. and Zelnorm, a medicine for irritable bowel syndrome and constipation that was later withdrawn from the United States market.
In a filing last winter, Novartis said it was increasing reserves by $318 million in the fourth quarter, to a total of $397 million, to pay for pending settlements into past marketing practices.
As part of the settlement, Novartis also signed a five-year corporate integrity agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services, which requires the company to monitor its sales practices and report any irregularities.
Frank Lichtenberg, a Columbia professor who receives pharmaceutical financing for research on innovation in the industry, said off-label prescribing was encouraged by the American Medical Association and paid for by insurers, but off-label marketing was clearly illegal.
“So it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on,” he said.
Dr. Lichtenberg said the nation might be seeing a peak in drug companies’ settling such cases and the misconduct might decline in the future because of stepped-up enforcement and corporate integrity agreements."ÿÿNovartis Settles Off-Label Marketing Case

Novartis has become the latest Western drugmaker to be accused of bribing doctors in China and has started an investigation into the allegations.
The claims were made by a former sales representative at the company's Chinese operations who has reportedly filed a complaint with the authorities, saying she was instructed to pay bribes to doctors in return for prescribing Novartis drugs.
Specifically, the unnamed rep said she was told to pay inducements of 50,000 yuan (around $8,000) to doctors who had prescribed at least five doses of Novartis' growth hormone inhibitor Sandostatin LAR (octreotide), used to treat some forms of gastrointestinal cancer.
Novartis said it had launched an internal investigation into the allegations, and said the whistleblower had filed a claim for 5m yuan ($800,000) in compensation after resigning from the company.
""Novartis takes allegations of misconduct seriously and will take appropriate actions depending on the findings once the investigation is concluded, said the company in a statement.
The latest allegations emerged in an article published by the 21st Century Business Herald, the same newspaper that published claims that Sanofi had offered bribes of around $280,000 to more than 500 doctors in China.
Novartis is now the third company to have been accused of paying bribes, after GlaxoSmithKline was linked to the payment of almost $490m in kickbacks to doctors and health officials using a series of middlemen, including travel agencies and consultancy firms.
All three companies say they are cooperating with the authorities and there is speculation that other drugmakers may also soon be dragged into the probe amid suggestions that there has been a culture of paying kickbacks by the pharma industry - particularly to doctors in state-run hospitals who are generally low-paid - over many years.
Last week, China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) unveiled a three-month probe into bribery in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
Other companies reporting they have already been visited by the authorities in recent weeks include Novo Nordisk, Lundbeck, Lilly, AstraZeneca, and UCB."ÿÿNovartis drawn into Chinese corruption probe

Two former Greek prime ministers, former ministers and bankers have responded to the inclusion of their names in the Novartis bribery case tabled in parliament.
The Swiss pharmaceuticals company is being investigated by Greek authorities over allegations of bribery towards public officials in the 2006-2015 period.
According to the Athens Macedonian News Agency (AMNA), the ministers named in the file served in the ministries of health, economy and development. The case will be submitted to parliament, as required by the law over ministerial immunity from prosecution.
Corruption prosecutor Eleni Touloupaki handed over part of an ongoing investigation into allegations of corruption and bribery to Supreme Court prosecutor Xeni Dimitriou after the names of two former prime ministers and eight former ministers appeared, sources in the prosecution said on Monday.
Retired senior judge Panagiotis Pikrammenos, who served as caretaker prime minister in the period between May 2012 and June 2012 before being succeeded by Antonis Samaras, said on Monday he and the cabinet he presided over had not been involved in any way in the scandal.
Samaras accused the current prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, of slander on Monday.
“I was informed about Mr. Tsipras’ new slander against me. And in fact, from fabricated testimonies by anonymous people,” Samaras said. “And since slander is the weapon of cowards, I tell them that they do not touch me. And they can be certain that the slanderers and those behind them will be held accountable to justice,” he told AMNA.
‘Bullying’
Bank of Greece Governor Yiannis Stournaras, who served as finance minister from July 2012 to June 2014, said he never signed any decisions remotely related to Novartis.
“The political targeting and bullying suffered by me and my family for three years now has its limits. During my term as finance minister I never signed any decision directly or indirectly related to Novartis. Incidentally, based on the law, the minister of finance has no relevant competence,” Stournaras said in a statement.
EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said on Monday that the pricing of pharmaceutical products was not in the health ministry’s jurisdiction during his tenure as health minister between 2006 and 2009.
“I was surprised to learn that my name was mentioned in the Novartis case that was sent to parliament along with other names of prime ministers and ministers in the period 2006-2009.
“In the period that I was health minister, from 2006-2009, the policy on pharmaceuticals and their pricing was not in the health ministry’s competence and therefore I had no involvement, and could not have any [involvement] in this issue,” he told AMNA.
Former Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos called the inclusion of his name in the Novartis scandal “a cheap political diversion”.
“As the public interest was and remains my guiding principle, I will not remain silent on the government’s barbaric assault on institutions in a rule of law which it carried out with the unfortunate assistance of judicial officials, in order to set up a cheap political diversion,” Venizelos told AMNA."ÿÿGreek Officials Hit Back at Novartis Bribery Allegations

Klaus Moosmayer has been appointed Novartis' chief ethics, risk and compliance officer, a new more powerful position created after the scandal surrounding multi-million dollar payments to Michael Cohen.
Earlier this year Novartis found itself in a storm of controversy after its then-CEO Joe Jimenez was revealed to have signed off payments to Donald Trump’s then lawyer and ‘fixer’ Michael Cohen.
The payments amounted to $100,000 a month for one year in return for advice on the Trump administration - even though it quickly transpired that Cohen wasn't able to provide any relevant insights.
Novartis was one of several companies caught in the spotlight when payments were exposed, and the company struggled to explain why the fees hadn't been declared in its accounts, suggesting the company had been engaged in dubious 'back channel' engagements in the all-important US market.
New chief executive Vas Narasimhan quickly moved to tighten the reins on Novartis’ ethics and compliance functions, while the company’s head of legal Felix Ehrat claimed responsibility for the scandal by resigning.
Ehrat (pictured below) resigned after it was discovered that he was co-signatory, along with Jimenez, on the contract to hire Cohen’s firm, which provided the consultancy services.
However, now attempting to “win and maintain the trust of society and stakeholders”, Novartis has hired Moosmayer in the chief ethics role, and will join the executive committee of Novartis, its most senior board of leaders. Shannon Thyme Klinger was recently appointed group general counsel, and has been in charge of the chief ethics position in the interim period.
Commenting on his new role, Moosmayer said he aims to build a “world class risk and compliance function” at Novartis.
He added: “Society has high expectations of the pharmaceutical industry and rightfully so. I am pleased to see that there is already a strong focus on driving personal accountability for behaviours, and generating learnings that can be applied across the organisation with Novartis.”
Moosmayer joins Novartis from multi-industry company Siemens, where he has served as chief compliance officer since January 2014 and prior to that, he served as chief counsel compliance at the company for four years.
His career history has seen him practise law in Germany, specialising in 'white collar crime', litigation and business law. He has also been chair of the anti-corruption task force of the business and industry advisory committee at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Novartis chief executive Vas Narasimhan, said: “Klaus has extensive experience in leading compliance for large global organisations and is internationally recognised in his field.

OneCircle, formerly known as Lightweight Containers, has produced a version of its market-leading 30L KeyKeg with an overall recycled material content of 58%. This is a world first development for a keg using such a high percentage of rPET. The circular keg will be showcased at the OneCircle booth at BrauBeviale, Germany. The technical innovation is part of OneCircle’s commitment to the circular economy and its ambition to produce keys from 100% recycled material in the future.

KeyKeg is the most innovative, safe and sustainable PET keg range and is revolutionising distribution by providing premium protection for draught beverages, ensuring they reach consumers around the world as fresh as the day they were produced. Its Double Wall technology ensures maximum safety during shipping, transport and dispensing and the unique laminated inner bag inside a high-tech PET container protects the taste and shelf-life of beverages better than single-walled kegs.

In the new keg, the outer container contains 62.5% post-consumer RPET material and the load-bearing inner container contains 40% post-industrial RPET material. Like every KeyKeg, the grip and basecup are made of 100% recycled PP. The product has been mechanically tested and passed all demanding tests which ensure KeyKeg’s high quality standards.

The availability of recycled materials in the marketplace is currently limited. Therefore, OneCircle is rapidly growing its KeyKeg collection community in order to ensure it has enough supply of circular materials to reuse in new kegs. OneCircle is aiming to start producing KeyKegs containing 45% recycled material in the second quarter of 2020.    KeyKeg is currently collected through hubs in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Switzerland, Ireland and Belgium.

EU legislation requests all packaging to contain at least 25% of recycled materials in 2025 and 30% of recycled materials in 2030. By achieving the 45% goal, OneCircle will by far exceed the demands in EU regulations for 2030 already next year. OneCircle has also joined the Plastic Alliance and signed its declaration that its products meet the environmental criteria of the European Union so no additional tax needs to be levied on its products.

Commenting on the development, Bert Hanssen from OneCircle said: “OneCircle is committed to increasing the recycled content of its kegs as quickly as possible. That’s why we have taken the initiative and created our own collection hubs to boost recycling alongside existing waste streams. We want to grow the community as quickly as possible to enable the production of KeyKegs containing the maximum amount of recycled materials and make the circular economy a reality.”

About KeyKeg/Unikeg

KeyKeg and Unikeg are serving thousands of happy customers from warehouses and sales offices spread worldwide and production facilities in the United States, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom and the company’s native Netherlands. Across all continents, breweries, winemakers, producers of soft drinks and other beverages are making the switch to KeyKeg and UniKeg.

* At the same time, outside activists on Thursday interrupted a keynote speech from Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels at the company’s annual AWS Summit in New York City.,
* Amazon executives have previously avoided answering questions from employees about having Palantir as a customer. Palantir did not respond to a request for comment from Forbes. Amazon on Monday said ""companies and government organizations need to use existing and new technology responsibly and lawfully"" but did not address whether it would stop hosting Palantir.,
The email, which has been circulating internally since Monday, asks employees to sign onto the June 2018 letter demanding Amazon stop selling its facial recognition technology to government agencies and drop Palantir as an AWS customer.
The email cites a renewed sense of urgency in response to the squalid conditions at several migrant detention centers that have been widely reported over the last month. The New York Times also reported Thursday that ICE will carry out immigration raids on at least 2,000 immigrants living in the U.S. with deportation orders.
“Our demands have become even more urgent given recent news. The U.S. government has been responsible for detaining people, including young children, in concentration camps under horrific conditions,” the email reads.
Palantir, which was founded by Trump ally and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, has come under scrutiny because its software has been used by ICE agents to identify and start deportation proceedings against undocumented migrants, the Intercept reported. Palantir pays Amazon for its cloud computing network.
“This is a horrifying violation of human rights—and it’s powered by AWS,” the internal email reads.
While employees are working to protest internally, a group of demonstrators that included pro-immigration organizations such as Mijente and Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, interrupted the keynote speech at Amazon’s annual AWS Summit. According to activists, more than 500 people also staged a protest outside.
“You just heard the voices of and the tears of children being held in detention facilities. Cut your ties to ICE Vogel, and all you tech workers are being complicit,” one protester shouted.
Amazon said, in an emailed statement, ""There is clearly a need for more clarity from governments on what is acceptable use of AI and ramifications for its misuse, and we’ve provided a proposed legislative framework for this. We remain eager for the government to provide this additional clarity and legislation, and will continue to offer our ideas and specific suggestions.”"ÿÿInternal Email: Amazon Faces Pressure From More Than 500 Employees To Cut Ties With Palantir For Working With ICE

Matthew Marks, Pallite compliance and sustainability manager, said after three rounds of use and recycling, around 50% of the materials used to make a Pallite pallet would still be in use, while 97% of those used in a wooden pallet would have been wasted – either downcycled into wood chip, panel board or kindling, or burnt, contributing to carbon dioxide emissions.

Patagonia has spent a lot of time and money on billing itself as a sustainable, environmentally-friendly brand. In 2011, the company slapped its anti-consumerism ""Don't Buy This Jacket"" advertisements all over the U.S.--effectively suggesting people not buy its products. And it regularly touts the work-life balance policies first codified by Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard. A company mantra displayed prominently and reverently adhered to: ""Let my people go surfing.""
Imagine the shock when in 2011 the company learned that some of its suppliers put workers through deplorable conditions--including making them pay thousands of dollars just to work. To secure a job in Taiwan, migrant workers must pay a ""broker"" to help them find a position. As Patagonia notes, these fees can be upwards of $7,000, and can take migrant workers more than two years to repay.
""We quite frankly discovered modern slavery in our supply chain,"" says Adam Fetcher, Patagonia's global director of PR. He adds that the problem is pervasive and plagues manufacturers of all kinds in many industries. ""For Patagonia, it became an urgent priority to fix it,"" he says.
In a blog post, the outdoor outfitter says that it first became aware of mistreatment of its factory workers after extending its ""social responsibility audits"" to include its Tier 2 suppliers in 2011. Looking specifically at the conditions of migrant workers in its factories in Taiwan, Patagonia discovered that many migrant workers were subject to long hours, low wages, and enormous broker fees.
Migrant workers have long had a tumultous history in Taiwan. Over the past 30 years, Taiwan has been losing factory business to China, where labor costs are much lower. As a result, factory owners in Taiwan have started to hire migrant workers over locals. Local workers were further thwarted when the Taiwanese government passed a law in 2012 permitting companies to have a workforce of up to 40 percent migrant workers, a 5 percent increase from the previous cap.
Patagonia partnered with Verite, a NGO that focuses on securing fair working conditions for workers around the world, to implement changes in its supply chain. As of June 1, Patagonia's Taiwanese suppliers can no longer require migrant workers to pay broker fees to secure a job. They must also repay current workers affected by broker fees. Going forward, factory owners either have to pay the fee themselves, or find workers without using a broker. The company also wrote a guide outlining its new employment standards for migrant workers, displaying it on Patagonia's website, and held meetings with Taiwanese suppliers to explain the new changes.
This isn't the first time Patagonia has highlighted its problems on its company blog--it acknowledged using a Durable Water Repellent in its jackets that had toxic byproducts for years. Still, it's a rare misstep for the typically-polished company. And while it seems to have taken a few too many years to address the oversight, the company's effort to address its supply chain is admirable--and serves as a lesson for other entrepreneurs who must cope with similarly systemic shocks.
That pledge has paid off in the eyes of some big players. In January, the retailer's Chief Operating Officer, Doug Freeman, and Director of Social Environmental Responsibility Cara Chacon were asked to present on the company's work at the White House Forum on Combating Human Trafficking in Supply Chains. By acknowledging its mistakes to customers, Patagonia has proven that its commitment to social issues doesn't just start and end in the store."ÿÿWhat Patagonia Did When It Found Human Slaves in Its Supply Chain

          We started developing our social responsibility program in the mid-1990s, working side by side with factory partners. In 2001, we became a founding member of the Fair Labor Association, a nonprofit that works to improve working conditions worldwide.With over a decade of close focus on our cut-and-sew factories, in 2011, we moved one link back in the supply chain to audit labor practices in the mills that make our fabrics. After joining Fair Trade USA’s apparel program in 2014—an effort that required us to change our internal procedures and work across many departments to embed the Fair Trade principles—we launched a successful pilot of 10 Fair Trade styles in the fall of that year.This year marks a giant step forward as we grow our Fair Trade numbers to 480 styles and 14 factories. The effort has been worthwhile because now 15,700 factory workers are directly benefiting from every Patagonia Fair Trade purchase, and the factories we work with can scale their Fair Trade production when other brands sign on.

          How Fair Trade Makes an ImpactHelena Barbour, Patagonia’s Vice President of Global Sportswear, is one of the driving forces behind the Fair Trade USA (FTUSA) partnership and the ongoing initiative to steadily increase the number of Fair Trade products at Patagonia. We spoke with her to get some insight into the early steps she took to usher in this company-wide change.Why did you want to create a Fair Trade apparel line?In early 2014, I visited several factories in Sri Lanka with our production team. It reminded me that although we purchase clothes based on fabric and fit in the store, the people who make our clothes are a huge part of the equation and are often forgotten. Most people—including myself—know very little about the people who make their clothing.I came back wanting to do something, and after a colleague mentioned Fair Trade USA were in the early stages of partnering with apparel companies, was hopeful that this could be a tangible solution to empowering workers and recognizing them.FTUSA has long been associated with coffee and chocolate and already had programs in place. They provided the link between what I saw in the factories and how we could make further improvements. And in terms of the opportunity to scale, I knew that we could use the sportswear product line to amplify the really good work our Social Responsibility team was already doing in our factories.FTUSA has also spent decades working to fight poverty in the nonprofit sector and has learned through experience what motivates and inspires workers. One of the most empowering aspects of the FTUSA program is that a brand pays a premium to a workers fund, and through a democratic process, workers decide how to spend the money. By making workers central figures in financial decision-making, it creates a true sense of partnership.Because we were able to work with FTUSA, everything happened quite quickly and it was a matter of months before we had a program in place. We were able to launch 10 styles in June, 2014.What happened next?We weren’t sure what to expect, but early on we realized the benefits extended way beyond just paying premiums directly to workers. It opened up constructive dialogue between workers and management, and engaged workers directly in making collective decisions about how to use premiums.Still, it was not a clear path, especially since we were the first apparel company to dramatically scale Fair Trade across multiple factories and regions. The concept seemed like a win-win for the factory and workers so it was hard to anticipate some of the trepidation expressed by factory owners. Their questions made us look even harder at the Fair Trade program and actually helped us gain more confidence in the work we were about to do.Sometimes the factory owners would ask, “Why don’t you just pay us more and we’ll pay workers more?” But having a third party like Fair Trade USA monitoring the program was important. We can’t just say to our customers, “We’re doing the right thing,” and expect them to blindly trust us. But those early rough patches ended up opening up many dialogues between workers and managers, which in itself was another type of success.How did workers choose to use the Fair Trade premiums?For me, that was when the program really came alive. We have seen the premiums used in a variety of ways, from water filters in every workers home to a cash bonus at the end of the year. But what was surprising was that it wasn’t always an obvious benefit that served the majority.For example, in Sri Lanka the workers voted on a daycare center, which serves mothers and fathers with young children in the factory. While not every worker will benefit from this directly, as a whole, the workforce felt it was worthwhile to have a program that helped parents maintain their jobs, which in the end, benefits everyone at the factory. The way the premiums are used take on the character of the people participating in the program. It’s not a cookie-cutter solution, which is a really great thing.What are some of the broader implications of Fair Trade?Again, it goes back to recognizing the people who make our apparel. Brands have a lot of power. Factory workers don’t. Being able to work in safe conditions and to have a voice in the workplace is hugely empowering. Also, the majority of factory workers are women, and every woman deserves the right to feel financially empowered. Fair Trade is one of several programs we are using to meet and elevate our commitment to social responsibility.What would you say to someone who doesn’t know anything about Fair Trade?Of course most people recognize that their clothing is made out of materials, but it’s important to understand that it’s also made by hands. And the people who make our clothing deserve to be seen and recognized. Fair Trade is one way to achieve that goal. It’s so much more than just paying premiums to workers. It positively affects workers lives, but also factories, brands and customers who get to make informed choices. It’s about a journey together to change the way we think about our clothing and the people behind it.

          Creating a More Equitable Global EconomySince launching Fair Trade USA in 1998 (in a one-room converted warehouse in Oakland, California), Paul Rice has helped build a vibrant global movement to change the way goods are produced, traded and consumed. We spoke with him about his early steps with Fair Trade USA and his goals for the future.Why is there a need for Fair Trade products?First, we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Globalization is already happening. The lowering of trade barriers over the last 20 or 30 years has led to a dramatic increase of trade, and with that, economic growth. Unfortunately, the benefits of globalization are not trickling down to the world’s poorest people. Literally billions of people are being left behind.How does Fair Trade help with that?In addition to creating rigorous social, environmental and economic standards to improve working conditions and protect the environment, we’re using a market-based approach that uses the power of companies and consumers to create sustainable solutions to some really challenging problems.How did you get started in Fair Trade? I got started fresh out of college. I wanted to be involved in international development, so in 1983 I bought a one-way ticket to Nicaragua to work with farmers. I worked on several well-intentioned projects funded by international aid that aimed to alleviate poverty. They were all top-down, charity-driven programs. All of them failed. I developed a belief that they failed because we didn’t figure out how to develop the farmers’ own capacity to solve their own problems. The farmers didn’t want our charity. They just wanted a decent return for all their hard work.What was your “light bulb” moment?I was pretty disillusioned with charity work and was about to bail and head back to the U.S. Then around 1990 I heard about these crazy people in Europe called “Fair Traders.” They were offering a dramatically higher price if we could just get our coffee farmers organized and sell directly to them. It was such a simple, powerful concept based on trade, not aid, and a fair price for a great product. I got 24 braves souls to sign up. We went from getting ten cents to $1.26 for a pound of coffee.Soon we had over 3,000 families signed up. It was a transformational moment for me. I realized that we could use the market as a powerful force for good. In essence, a new model for capitalism. All of a sudden families were able to eat three times a day instead of two times a day. Schools were being built. There was also an increase of hope, pride and self-confidence—what I call the “invisible dividends.”Can you explain how Fair Trade works?One of the most important aspects of the Fair Trade movement is that we go beyond social auditing and compliance. We know that model is broken. An outside auditor coming into a factory doesn’t really understand what’s going on. We know problems are still there and this approach doesn’t do enough. There’s a role for it, but it’s not enough.That’s why we provide workers and management with compliance training so everyone knows their rights and can be involved in enforcing standards. Beyond that there needs to be some type of incentive to do the work and become a Fair Trade factory. That’s where premiums come in. It’s a way to address the deepest problems, while also rewarding responsible production.For every Fair Trade Certified™ product sold, the company pays an additional premium that goes directly into a worker-managed account. The workers decide how to spend every dollar, based on what their greatest needs are. It could be scholarships, community projects or medical care. They can also vote to take the premium as a cash bonus.When did you start offering Fair Trade certification in the apparel Industry?We spent several years developing a certification model specific to the apparel industry, and then officially launched in 2010. Even though the factory program is different from our roots in agriculture, the basic premise remains the same: If you buy a Fair Trade product, you can reach halfway across the world and help a family create a better life for themselves and their community.What have you learned about your approach to businesses?I’m a mission-driven guy and I’ve found a lot of like-minded mission-driven leaders in corporate America. More often than not Fair Trade appeals to the values of executives, but unfortunately some, but not all, have had to check their values at the door. I spend a lot of time taking CEOs to the places where products are made, to show them the true power that their company and their customers have to transform lives. This experience is always a game changer.How does the customer fit into all of this?This whole thing hinges on customers purchasing products, whether it’s a chocolate bar or a fleece sweater. We’re essentially asking them to be our allies. They are at the heart of our theory of change. Just like Fair Trade premiums are empowering in communities, the purchasing act is also empowering. Conscience consumers have the power to affect change, especially when they feel like the government isn’t serving their interests in a particular area.Where do you think all of this is heading?I see a new model of globalization that’s emerging and growing very rapidly. Fair Trade proves that you can eliminate the conflict between profitability and sustainability. If we can combine this idea of doing the right thing and supporting company profitability, then we’ve hitched ourselves to the most powerful force around.This story first appeared in the October 2017 Patagonia catalog.Visit patagonia.com/fairtradeclothing to see the entire collection.

Patagonia's 'Sustainable Wool' Supplier Exposed: Lambs Skinned Alive, Throats Slit, Tails Cut OffEyewitness video shows workers plunging knives into the throats of conscious lambs and starting to skin them while they’re still alive and moving.Video take actionThis video should mean that millions of people will think twice about ever buying wool socks and sweaters again. A gut-churning PETA video exposé reveals that life is hell for lambs and other sheep exploited for so-called “responsibly sourced” wool on so-called “sustainable” farms. A witness found workers in Argentina hacking into fully conscious lambs, starting to skin some of them while they were still alive and kicking, and otherwise mutilating, abusing, and neglecting lambs and sheep on farms in the Ovis 21 network—Patagonia’s wool supplier.UPDATE:  Under pressure from consumers who have pledged to bury, burn, return and give away anything they have with the Patagonia brand, and never buy again, Patagonia has gone beyond apologizing, and now says it will not buy more wool until it can extract certain assurances from its supplier. On August 17, 2015, following PETA’s expose, Patagonia announced that it was dropping Ovis 21 as a supplier and would not buy wool again until the company could be assured of “the humane treatment of animals.” PETA praises the new move, as ‘all steps are good steps,’ but cautions that as Patagonia delves deeper into the wool supply chain, it will find that cruelty will always be a part of wool production as we have found in Australia, the U.S., and now Argentina. If the company is honest, we doubt it could return to buying real wool again.UPDATE:  Patagonia and  Stella McCartney have stopped sourcing from Ovis 21, and after a meeting with PETA, Kering also agreed to stop sourcing from Ovis 21 for all brands, including Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Brioni, Christopher Kane, Gucci, Volcom and Saint Laurent. Bound by Their Legs, Slashed Open, and Skinned While Still Alive and KickingWorkers picked up gentle lambs and—while they were fully conscious—tied their legs together, plunged knives into their throats, and sawed through their necks. Blood poured from the wounds as they kicked with their only free leg. Workers then snapped their heads backwards, apparently trying to break their necks.Even after all that, some of the lambs still managed to cry out and gasp.Minutes later, some lambs were still alive and kicking when a worker drove a knife into their legs to start skinning them. Eventually, they were hacked apart. Their organs were carved out of their bodies and their severed heads dumped into a bloody tub.All this happened in full view of other lambs. They were just feet away and cried out in what must have been terror and severe distress. Older sheep—used for their wool, then no longer wanted—were lined up, tackled, and dragged away to be shipped to slaughter.Ears Mutilated, Tails Cut Off, Castrated—All Without Pain ReliefAs is common in the wool industry, lambs who were kept for their wool endured hideous mutilations—all without anesthetics or any pain relief.A manager used a tool similar to pliers to cut out pieces of the lambs’ sensitive ears, which dripped with blood onto his hands. He wiped the blood off on one of the lambs.He also put a tight ring around one lamb’s scrotum, which is extremely painful. These rings cut off the blood supply to the testicles, which are expected to shrivel and die over the course of several weeks.Then, another worker cut off their tails. Lambs are prey animals who suffer in silence, rather than drawing attention to themselves and attracting further predation, but they struggled as much as they could while the workers restrained them. They were then unceremoniously dumped onto the ground, where they huddled together as blood dripped from their ears and the stumps of their tails.The man just tossed their mutilated tails onto the ground.Stomped and Cut Open During Shearing, Left to Suffer, Die, and Be EatenThis exposé found cruelty among Argentina’s shearing crews similar to that documented in Australia and the U.S. in 2014.Shearers stomped and stood on sheep’s legs. Fast, rough shearing left them cut up and bleeding.One sheep’s internal tissue protruded from a serious shearing wound. A worker dragged the bloodied sheep away. Another worker, carrying a needle and thread, followed. After evidently having crudely sewed up the gaping wound without any pain relief, the men dragged the sheep back and clipped off the rest of the wool. The next day, a worker said that the sheep had died as a result of the wound and would be eaten by the workers, but the shearer who had mortally wounded the sheep was right back on the job.One sheep, whose back right leg was broken, was sheared and left in a pen—in pain and without any care—for at least an hour before being slaughtered and eaten, according to a manager.You Can Help Stop This!No matter where wool comes from, whether it’s “responsibly sourced” or from a “sustainable” farm, it’s the needless product of a cruel business. There is simply no way to raise and kill animals for the mass market in a humane way. To protect sheep from this abuse, please, refuse to buy wool. It’s easy to check the label when you’re shopping. If it says “wool,” leave it on the shelf.Please thank Patagonia for dropping Ovis 21, but urge them to drop all wool in favor of animal-friendly materials because there is simply no such thing as humane wool.

          On the best days—on any day, in fact—the view from the Mirador is about as beautiful as one could ever imagine. Past the stands of cactus in the foreground, you look out to the castle-like ramparts of the Morros, the swirling congregations of seabirds, and the long lines of swell marching in from the Pacific and barreling into whitewater as they sweep along the point.It’s a vista that the people of Punta de Lobos have admired for generations, becoming an integral part of their lives and identities in this small community on the Chilean coast. But like any beautiful ocean view, it’s also been highly coveted by developers in recent years—because to their minds, what seascape wouldn’t be that much better from the seventh floor of a condo tower?The surfers and fishing families of Punta de Lobos have never thought that way, thankfully, and ground level has always worked just fine to gaze out at one of the world’s best lefthand points. Though it’s surfable at almost any size, Lobos holds well into the XXL range, and it was on big winter days here that our close friend and surf ambassador Ramón Navarro honed his skills in heavy surf. Though he hailed from a place far removed from the centers of the surf industry, his fearless performances earned him a deserved place among the world’s big wave elite.

          In the years that followed, traveling around the world to ride huge waves only reinforced something Ramón had always known—that the place where he grew up was priceless and absolutely irreplaceable. So when Ramón, along with other local activists, learned that there were potential plans for large-scale development along the Lobos shoreline, they rallied hard to protect the place they loved. Their vision was to keep the area’s marine and terrestrial environments as intact as possible, to keep development in check, and to ensure continued access to the ocean for the community of people who called Lobos home.Before long, with Ramón’s leadership, a passionate group of local surfers, environmentalists, government officials and business leaders banded together, and Patagonia decided to do as much as possible to help. Save The Waves Coalition led a successful crowdfunding campaign called Lobos Por Siempre, gathering small donations from surfers all over the world. Chris Malloy directed a short film and collected stories for a book to raise awareness. Patagonia then matched $100,000 in donations, with the funds helping local activists establish the nonprofit Fundación Punta de Lobos. Work began to establish Lobos as a World Surfing Reserve, and to raise funds to purchase private properties along the point and transfer them to the Fundación for conservation.This past summer, we donated $150,000 from our PSI Vest licensing program to the campaign. But a substantial funding gap still remained before the Mirador, the iconic property at the top of the point, could be purchased.Believing in the necessity of taking practical action to protect threatened places, we decided to donate another substantial sum to close the gap. Chilean philanthropist Nicholas Davis had generously held the Mirador in trust until it could be purchased for conservation, and it has now been successfully transferred to the Fundación—saving the Mirador from development forever. ¡Por siempre! Punta de Lobos now has full status as a World Surfing Reserve, and a celebration of the reserve’s dedication will be held this November. It’s an all-too-rare conservation success story, and huge thanks are owed to everyone who contributed to the campaign in ways great or small.

          “The most important thing is what this place will be for future generations,” Ramón says. “I want my son to be able to enjoy this place as I did, and I’ve been learning that anything is possible when communities come together to find common ground. For me, this work is really about leaving a legacy, and the only way to accomplish that is by being an example and protecting the places that gave me the memories I cherish. As a surfer, contests and trophies are good for your ego and that’s about it.

The Fundación is still in need of support to restore and preserve the point, and it is currently working to acquire further properties at Punta de Lobos to protect their beauty and biodiversity for generations to come.

          “Nature is the only thing we can count on for real and forever. And we have an amazing opportunity to do things right, to learn from many mistakes, and to upraise as much as possible our unique nature while it’s being developed so fast,” notes Matías Alcade, the Fundación’s executive director.“We need to care and make people care. We need to find market-based solutions, upstream from the final environmental problems. I have been inspired working with a unique group of humans, giving a special mention to Ramón Navarro and Nicholas Davis who are really creating a difference. That difference, plus the relevance that Punta de Lobos has for surfers, tourists and scientists, will help this serve as a prototype for future settlements along our coastline. We have the opportunity to save what’s important, and the moment is now.”

          Before we could challenge the snow industry to move to recycled materials, we had to change our thinking, too.There are a number of ways to reduce a garment’s impact, but none more significant than making it out of recycled fabric. Doing so keeps material out of landfills and cuts demand for the petroleum used to make weather-resistant stuff like nylon and polyester—the material used in every ski or snowboard jacket you’ve ever worn (including ours). Ironically, anytime we’ve looked to switch to a nonvirgin fabric, we’ve basically had to start from square one.The problem isn’t the science, it’s convincing our partners that there’s a healthy demand for recycled alternatives—and making sure there’s zero compromise in performance. “The industry has had a mental block, a stigma around recycled, so for a long time we didn’t even try,” says Pasha Whitmire, Patagonia’s senior material developer. Whitmire is as easygoing as he is unwavering—valuable qualities when you’re trying to change people’s minds. Once he did, he found that working with fabrics made from postconsumer waste was just not that hard. He helped develop a new PowSlayer Jacket with 100% recycled GORE-TEX Pro face fabric (the first of its kind), which we introduced last year and remains a favorite with backcountry skiers and snowboarders. Still, that was just one, highly specialized jacket.“The real gut punch for me was going to one of the biggest textile-producing regions in the world,” says Whitmire. “In just one factory, thousands of weaving machines produce meters of new, petroleum-based fabric every minute. It’s pretty sickening.” Whitmire realized we could do more, so now we’re extending the PowSlayer’s recycled benchmark across our Snow line.No question, we’ve had failures along the way. Our tearing instrument, which puts a small cut in the fabric and tests at different forces, would rip a piece easier than we’d like for those minute nicks and cuts that inevitably happen from ski edges or a crampon encounter. Or the abrasion machine would destroy a material after rubbing it vigorously with the rough side of a Velcro® fastener. Every recycled Snow shell we build must be just as bomber as its virgin counterpart or we won’t release it.This fall, 77 percent of our Snow garments passed those tests and are fabricated with recycled content, including our popular Powder Bowl Jacket. This diverts more plastic bottles and nylon than ever from the waste stream and into the Snow gear we make. Now, the wide availability of these previously discarded materials has the potential to change the industry, and we’re hoping other brands will start to use them, too.“If it can be thought up,” Whitmire says, “then we can make it happen. The path is rarely blazed for us, but we’ll happily set the track.”Visit patagonia.com to see the entire Snow collection.

          The Trump administration wants to open almost all of America’s coastline to the oil industry, putting our beaches and oceans at serious risk.Fifty years ago, an offshore rig spilled 100,000 barrels of crude oil into California’s Santa Barbara Channel, creating a 35-mile slick that fouled the wave-rich shoreline from Goleta to Ventura.It should have been the end of offshore oil in the United States, but Big Oil don’t surf, and the industry has always been more concerned about its own profits than the damage done to America’s waves, waters and marine wildlife. So our oceans keep suffering—and not just from high-profile spills like Santa Barbara in 1969, the Deepwater Horizon in 2010, and Refugio in 2015. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, “thousands of oil spills occur in U.S. waters each year,” and there have been 44 spills over 10,000 barrels each since the Santa Barbara catastrophe first brought offshore oil into the public eye.
            Spilled crude at the waterline on Refugio State Beach in Southern California. In May 2015, a ruptured oil pipe dumped over 140,000 gallons of oil with the slick spreading along seven miles of the Gaviota Coast. Hundreds of birds and marine mammals were killed, commercial fisheries were shut down for weeks, and the surf break at Refugio State Park was closed for months. Photo: Paul Wellman
          Now, despite the inarguable risks, the Trump administration is trying to open almost all of America’s coastline to drilling and exploration. The administration’s draft proposal was to “make more than 98 percent of the offshore continental shelf available,” and “allows for unprecedented access to America’s extensive offshore oil and gas resources.” It’s a radical and potentially disastrous plan that must be resisted by everyone who cares about America’s coasts, oceans and climate—especially those of us who want to keep on riding waves.“This is going to pollute the ocean and put our breaks at risk,” notes Pete Stauffer, the environmental director of the Surfrider Foundation. “Expanded drilling will also industrialize our coastlines and threaten coastal communities, economies and livelihoods. As surfers, we need to speak out against the federal government’s dangerous plans—the ocean is a public resource, and our leaders are required to consider the public’s input.”

          It’s not just an American issue, either—the global climate knows no borders, and neither do the ocean’s storms, swells and currents. Our friends Down Under are among the many surfers and activists standing up to Big Oil around the world, as a Norwegian company called Equinor tries to turn the Great Australian Bight into an oil field. The Bight is one of our planet’s last great tracts of marine wilderness, and the company’s own spill modeling shows the potential of oil washing up on the entire length of the South Australian coastline, not to mention the damage to water quality and wildlife offshore. Like the Trump proposal, drilling in Australia’s offshore waters is too dangerous to accept, and you can learn more about the Fight for the Bight here.
    Stop New Offshore Drilling
  Whether it’s America, Australia or anywhere else on our shared planet, what we do now will determine the future of our oceans, and there’s simply no time to lose. Patagonia is supporting Surfrider in its campaign to stop new offshore drilling, and you can help stop President Trump’s plan before it’s too late.

                          It's a growing business network around the world: Companies that commit to give 1 percent of their sales each year to environmental groups as members of the One Percent for The Planet alliance.More than 1,200 businesses in 48 countries now are One Percent members. They've donated more than $100 million so far through the network founded in 2002 by environmentalists and outdoor outfitters Yvon Chouinard of Patagonia and Craig Mathews of Blue Ribbon Flies.Donations to environmental groups reached about $25 million worldwide last year, including giving by more than a dozen firms based in Florida, according to the nonprofit alliance often called ""1%.""Entrepreneur Scott Seddon, a chef living in Palm Beach Gardens, joined more than four years ago with his firm, Rincon Heat Sauce Co., a hot-sauce maker with roots in surfing-haven Rincon in Puerto Rico.
            
  An avid surfer, Seddon donates 1 percent of his company sales yearly to Surfrider Foundation, a nonprofit that protects oceans, waves and beaches.The label on his hot-sauce specifies that donations go to Surfrider through One Percent, a message that has wooed buyers at surf shops who are familiar with Surfrider and its programs.""It's helped my sales a lot"" to be part of One Percent, said the 41-year-old Seddon. ""It's given me added exposure and easier access to some markets that I might not have entered into.""Hannah Helsabeck gives 1 percent of sales from her Plantation-based company, Essential Safe Products, to a fellow South Florida nonprofit: Reef Relief, which protects and improves coral reefs.
  ""I thought it would be nice to support our local environment, and reefs are getting ruined,"" she said of why she chose the Key West-based group for her support..Helsabeck could donate directly to Reef Relief, but she said she gladly pays $200 dues each year to One Percent to help promote the alliance and ""encourage more people to join and donate.""She also figures affiliation with the network — included on her website and other marketing materials — helps boost the credibility of her startup as community-minded and eco-friendly, likely helping sales.The recent college grad started her online business in 2011 after seeing her mother struggle to find non-toxic kitchen products. Her mom did extensive research online, but could find no single website that pre-selected healthy and safe products and made them available for purchase.
        
              Helsabeck decided to launch that site herself and offer a broader range of goods for the home.

She clicked on a link to learn more and soon joined, too.""This is a great way for us to give back,"" said HelsabeckOne Percent said it uses dues partly to check that members donate 1 percent of sales and that groups receiving the donations are legitimate.

          Glad you asked … and if you aren’t already aware, in December 2017, President Trump issued a proclamation slashing Utah’s Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, 100 miles to the west of Bears Ears, by half. In an unprecedented response, we joined a coalition of Native American and grassroots groups challenging the legality of the president’s action in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The legal theory is simple: The Antiquities Act of 1906 grants the president the authority to create national monuments, but not to reduce or rescind them.There are five pending lawsuits—two for Grand Staircase and three for Bears Ears. The district court has consolidated each set of cases—the Grand Staircase suits on one hand, the Bears Ears suits on the other—for administrative purposes so that the cases within each consolidated set proceed on the same schedule.In January 2018, the Trump administration tried to move the case from DC to Utah (the court refused), and in October, the government filed a motion to dismiss the complaint altogether. Each side has since submitted briefs. Right now, we’re awaiting a decision on whether the case will proceed from Judge Tanya S. Chutkan. That’s expected in mid-to-late 2019.We are proud to join several Native American Tribes (Hopi, Navajo Nation, Ute, Ute Mountain Ute, and Zuni) and conservation nonprofits in the Bears Ears litigation, including our co-plaintiffs: Utah Diné Bikéyah, Friends of Cedar Mesa, Conservation Lands Foundation, Archaeology Southwest, National Trust for Historic Preservation, Society of Vertebrate Paleontology and Access Fund. These two national monuments were designated to protect a multitude of sites of cultural significance to Native Americans. The facts aren’t in dispute. all five cases come down to what the Antiquities Act does—or doesn’t—say.“There continues to be a lot of misinformation about Native communities, and negative stereotypes, in the state of Utah, and these prevent the tribes from having equal rights and being treated as equal citizens,” says Honor Keeler, the assistant director of Utah Diné Bikéyah, who is working on the case. Establishing these monuments was part of a healing process, Keeler, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, says, and “an acknowledgement that Indigenous Peoples have a right to determine the future of their sacred and traditional homelands.”“I’ve been very encouraged by how well all the plaintiff attorneys are working in unison on these cases,” says Natalie Landreth, a senior staff attorney for the Native American Rights Fund, which is representing the tribes in their lawsuit. Landreth is a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation, and is based in Anchorage, Alaska. “Simply given the sheer number of people involved—something like 20 lawyers—it gives you pause. The collaboration has been much easier than expected, and it has really benefitted the case.”The political landscape surrounding Bears Ears, meanwhile, has changed considerably. In the past, Utah’s San Juan County Commission had opposed the designation of Bears Ears as a national monument. With the election in November 2018 of Willie Grayeyes, a Diné (Navajo) leader, the commission has since condemned the president’s move to slash the monument. Reflecting the wishes of a majority of local communities, the commission has gone further, passing a resolution supporting the monument’s restitution. In Congress, Arizona representative Ruben Gallego and New Mexico rep Deb Haaland introduced the Bears Ears Expansion And Respect for Sovereignty Act (BEARS Act), which would bring the monument to the size originally petitioned for—600,000 acres larger, in fact, than the boundaries then-President Obama designated in 2016.“While we’re waiting to see how the litigation plays out, the federal government—the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service—have been expediting the planning process for an Environmental Impact Statement for the Shash Jaa’ and Indian Creek units,” Keeler points out. “These two units comprise only 15% of the original Bears Ears National Monument boundary. We are concerned that the proper cultural surveys and environmental studies have not been done. To fully understand how to protect Bears Ears, meaningful consultations with tribes are necessary, which are part of the government-to-government relationship tribes have with the federal government. Tribes have maintained Bears Ears since time immemorial.”“While legally the tribes and NGOs are making the same case—that the president does not have the authority to reduce these monuments—the tribes have consistently asked for separate briefings to address their unique cultural concerns,” says Landreth. “While the public lands in a monument belong to everyone, the tribal interest in these areas is different from recreating in them. To the tribes, Bears Ears is very much alive. They have ancestors buried there, and still consider it part of their home to this day. This is a place where there are structures and human history that’s older than the Egyptian pyramids: the very kind of place the Antiquities Act was meant to protect. If there are to be arguments in front of the judge—and I hope there will be—that will be a place where these stories come alive.”For Patagonia, joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. For more than a decade the company has worked side by side with the tribes, climbers, canyoneers, trail runners and anglers to protect these public lands, so when Trump tried to offer them up to oil, gas and mining interests instead, the decision to sue came quickly.“It took exactly one email to the board,” says Patagonia General Counsel Hilary Dessouky. “And the response was instant: ‘Yes. Absolutely. Go for it.’”Learn more about why Patagonia is in the fight for Bears Ears at Patagonia Action Works.

        “Americans have voiced overwhelming support for protecting the Arctic Refuge, and the fight is far from over. If we destroy the Arctic Refuge today, we will never get that wild, unspoiled wilderness back.”
                  —Rose Marcario, President and CEO of PatagoniaOn December 20, Congress passed the tax bill that included a measure authorizing oil leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, exposing this fragile and beautiful landscape to the devastation that inevitably comes with exploration and extraction. Tragically, there was no real public debate on the issue. It was snuck past the American people as a means to a political end, and most Americans still don’t know that this pristine landscape, first set aside a half-century ago by Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, is now at grave risk of being destroyed. The refuge is, perhaps, our wildest and most intact American ecosystem and home to polar bears, caribou, musk oxen and millions of migratory birds. It is revered by the Gwich’in people, who call it “the sacred place where life begins.” Protecting the Arctic Refuge represents many things to us: the pinnacle of a decades long campaign to save our public lands. a fight for basic human rights. and an effort to save our entire planet from the impacts of fossil fuel driven climate change.For these reasons, we are more determined than ever to defend the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We stand with our partners and friends in this long effort, and the statements below represent and speak for many of the groups we work with. This is neither the beginning nor the end of the fight—but, it is a turning point, and a time for all Americans to wake up to the reality that, unless we push back hard, our most treasured places will be put on the chopping block.

          Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee“We’ve hit a whole new level of defense and this fight has just begun! We will rise up and protect the Arctic Refuge, the ‘Sacred Place Where Life Begins.’ We will not stop. We will not waiver. We will continue to protect our way of life, as we always have. Our identity is non-negotiable and our human rights inalienable.”In a Gwich’in creation story, the original people of the Arctic used to be caribou. When they separated, the caribou kept a bit of the human heart and the human kept a bit of the caribou heart. They made an oath that the caribou would always take care of the Gwich’in as long as the Gwich’in would always take care of the caribou. Photo: Florian SchulzPrincess Daazhraii Johnson, Gwich’in writer, organizer and actress“Passing of this highly unpopular tax bill that opens the Arctic Refuge to oil drilling is an assault upon indigenous human rights and sets a dangerous precedent for how we as humans will treat our remaining intact ecosystems on our planet. All of us must now stand to defend clean water, air, land—all the life sustaining elements of our Mother Earth. We continue to heed the call of ancestors and this land that has provided for the Gwich’in Nation for thousands of years and we recognize our fight has only just begun.”
            Musk oxen have been around since the Pleistocene era. along with caribou, they are the only hoofed animals that survived the end of that era (10,000 years ago). Today, they roam the open tundra of the Arctic Refuge in search of vegetation growing under or above the snow. Photo: Florian Schulz
          Andy Moderow, Alaska Wilderness League, Alaska director“President Trump’s allies in Congress just dishonored the past by voting to sell the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the highest bidder. If they succeed and oil development destroys one of America’s last wild areas, there is no doubt that history will judge them harshly. Our work today to protect this area just got more difficult, and we will be doubling down in the years ahead. We won’t stop until this truly wild place is protected for current and future generations alike—we know our lands and waters are worth it.”

          Mollie Foster, photographer and author of Hiking Alaska “Last August I started a two-week backpacking and packrafting trip in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, with a visit to the expansive oil development in Prudhoe Bay. We saw a few birds, in the shadows of oil rigs. It felt empty, dirty, and void of emotion. The contrast between the sights there, compared to backpacking through the wild, untouched landscape in the Arctic Refuge, is something I can’t get out of my head. The refuge is filled with signs of life everywhere, every day we walked by dozens of caribou antlers sheds, bear scat, and species of birds. We paddled our packrafts as a wolf swam across the river in front of us, just upriver from a cow moose with her calves. We saw signs of life, but very little signs of human life (a few bush plans the whole trip). I’ve covered miles of backcountry in Alaska traveling to each corner of the state through my work as a journalist and photographer. The Arctic Refuge is one of the most pristine, untouched landscapes I’ve ever visited, and I will fight for it, so future generations can have the same experiences I was so lucky to witness.”
            The Arctic Refuge offers unparalleled wilderness opportunities, including backpacking, camping, climbing and fishing. It has no phone service, cell phone coverage, campgrounds or ranger stations within its boundaries. Because of its remote nature and potentially extreme conditions, self-reliance is essential and the experience of true adventure is guaranteed. Photo: Florian Schulz
          Alli Harvey, Our Wild America Alaska campaign representative, Sierra Club“Wednesday was a dark day for me—the Republicans finally pushed through their horrible tax package which included drilling in the Arctic Refuge, and the sun barely rose up into the sky up here in Alaska. But today on the winter solstice I woke up more motivated than ever to fight back. Luckily, I know I’m not alone. A growing movement of people here in Alaska, led by the Gwich’in Nation, is committed to defending the refuge from the rampant greed and attack on human rights moved forward by this tax package. Where industry tries to go, we will be there, pushing back against drilling efforts that threaten the food security of the Gwich’in people, one of our country’s last great wild places, and our climate. This fight has only just begun.”Thank you to Florian Schulz for sharing his amazing photography with us. To learn more about Florian and how he’s fighting to save the Arctic, check out our interview with him from 2016.Thank you to Kahlil Hudson, director of The Refuge, a short film that tells the story of two Gwich’in women who are continuing the decades-long battle for their people’s survival—and the survival of the wild animals that so faithfully bring them life.

          Note: As of March 2017, Red Pine Land and Livestock is not a Patagonia supplier and their wool is not in our products.Over the past 10 months, we have been working diligently to develop a new wool supply chain that reflects high, and verifiable, standards for both animal welfare and land management. We’ve now reached some important milestones, and we’d like to update our customers on what we have accomplished so far and what we have yet to accomplish.BackgroundIn 2011, we partnered with The Nature Conservancy and Ovis 21 in a new program to grow merino wool that, through the use of holistic grazing practices, helped restore long-degraded grassland to health. The revival of the grassland also promised to keep sheep ranching, a threatened way of life, alive in Patagonia, Argentina.For restoring grassland, this was the best wool-producing program in the world for its time. It reflected what we had learned thus far about the compassionate treatment of animals. Patagonia, the region, did not have blowfly, so the sheep were not subjected to painful mulesing, they had room to roam, they were not fed hormones or antibiotics.Although we had begun, in 2014, to work within the Textile Exchange on the development of a Responsible Wool Standard, our own wool supply chain did not previously take a holistic approach to the twin issues of land management and animal welfare.We were dismayed when a representative of PETA, the animal rights organization, photographed ill treatment of animals on ranches supplying our merino wool. Although we took issue with many of PETA’s assertions, and to its tabloid tone, we were taken aback by what we saw in the video: callous indifference to animal suffering and a lack of compassionate handling.We explained to our customers that we would cease buying wool from any supplier until we were confident that we could meet an appropriately high standard of animal welfare—without sacrificing regenerative grazing practices.We’re glad we’ve had the opportunity to regroup, because we’ve learned a tremendous amount. The whole process—of consulting experts in animal welfare, engaging U.S. growers dedicated to humane treatment of animals, conducting in-depth field audits, and closely observing what it takes, in practice, to both revitalize the land and treat the animals well—reminded us very much of the days when we made the switch from conventionally grown to organic cotton. We’ve talked to the people who do the work, worked through what is actually possible, and put forth the highest possible standards in a new supply chain that involves the best possible partners.The Challenging Realities of Animal HusbandryThis is as good a place as any to talk about the difficulties involved in this task. Wool, like down, is a by-product of an animal that is ultimately killed and sold for its meat. Vegans, like some who work at Patagonia or like activists who work for PETA, may opt out by avoiding any human use of domesticated animals. For the rest of us, those who produce and eat meat and wear wool, down or leather, the question is more complex. We can do everything we can to ensure that animals do not suffer before they are slaughtered, and to slaughter them compassionately. But there is much work we need to do to develop a 21st century moral standard for the ethical treatment of animals.In the 20th century, our society adopted increasingly brutal methods of treatment for animals involved in factory farming, the penning and transportation in close, foul quarters, the wholesale administration of hormones and antibiotics, manipulation through targeted genetics that deprive animals of the ability to move or have a creaturely life. The actions of the ranch hands we saw in PETA’s video were more hands-on, less industrially cruel—but yet deeply ingrained in the way humans deal with animals, a product of culture centuries in the making. How does that change? Step 1: Consulting Experts in Animal WelfareTo help answer that question, we initially consulted a number of experts who are engaged in a critical shift in thinking about the emotional and intellectual capacities of animals, and what constitutes compassionate treatment of those whose lives we take for food.In addition to engaging directly with Four Paws and other animal rights organizations, as well as seasoned field auditors, we invited Dr. Temple Grandin to our headquarters in Ventura for a daylong meeting in which we absorbed the lessons of her lifetime spent advocating for the humane treatment of animals used for human consumption of all kinds.Through this process, we grew to understand there are three major opportunities to make meaningful, accountable change for the welfare of sheep in our wool supply chain:Initial commitment from the ranchers who own the land and the sheepEducation of ranch hands (who, when properly engaged, can exercise a deep responsibility for the health of both the land and the animals in their care)Adoption of clearly defined boundaries for noncompliance in critical areas—the bright lines in our approach that make up the highest possible bar for animal welfare—along with continuous reevaluation and improvement of our standardsStep 2: Defining Patagonia’s Standard for Animal Welfare & Land ManagementOver the course of many months, we’ve developed a new Patagonia Wool Standard that we believe brings together from several important sources the world’s most stringent criteria for animal welfare and responsible land management.Our standard provides strict guidance and accountability measures in key areas:Animal Welfare: The standard adopts the provisions of the Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) as a baseline for animal welfare, but also goes above and beyond:Patagonia’s standard includes special animal welfare provisions covering transportation and off-farm slaughter, as well as stockperson training in compassionate handling, avoiding shearing injuries, acceptable age ranges for castration and tail docking, and consistent availability of food and water.We will also exceed RWS baselines in the methodology for audits, which we require to be conducted in two phases: 1) during shearing, so that auditors can actually observe shearing practices and ensure standards are met, and 2) during lambing, so that auditors can witness the process of birth, tail docking, castration and all associated risks. (We are advocating that future versions of the RWS adopt these two phases as well, based on feedback we received from Dr. Grandin and others.)Responsible Land Management: Our approach includes the RWS’ strong land management provisions, which Patagonia played a lead role in developing based on our previous experiences with regenerative grazing practices. These requirements pertain both to grasslands and other biotic communities where sheep may be raised, including biodiversity protection, soil management, and pesticide and fertilizer use.Quality: Quality has always been and will continue to be a major pillar in our requirements for any materials sourcing, including wool. Our quality requirements exist independent of the Patagonia Wool Standard, and we expect the quality of our wool to only increase in our new supply chain.With these important pieces working together, we’ve built a rigorous standard containing strong accountability measures that—when coupled with strong supplier partnerships—will give us the greatest possible confidence that sheep in our wool supply chain will be assured:A compassionate end of life, whether through on-farm or off-farm slaughterReasonable transportation times and appropriate safeguards for safe food and water consumptionCareful, humane treatment by farm workers, including treatment during shearing and other practicesAll potentially painful procedures done under strict controlIn the end, 33 individual pieces of criteria in the Patagonia Wool Standard came directly from Dr. Grandin, who also participated in a review of our near-final standard in recent months, and many more came from or were refined during a robust stakeholder review with Four Paws, independent auditors, farms in the United States and New Zealand, and other expert organizations and individuals.You can view the Patagonia Wool Standard by clicking here.We will continue to keep you posted on our progress—and on the availability of our first products to include wool sourced under these high standards for animal welfare and regenerative grazing.Editor’s note: This story was updated on July 11, 2017 and July 26, 2017.

          Our company is proud to be part of the growing movement of Certified B Corporations. These companies practice “stakeholder capitalism”: They identify their most deeply held social and environmental values, then abide by them, honoring their responsibilities to their employees, customers, suppliers and communities—as well as to the financial health of their investors.In the six years since Patagonia became a B Corp we have seen the movement broaden across nations and industries and deepen in purpose. We have seen a new generation of entrepreneurs eager to go B at the outset, so that they communicate their significant values to investors, employees, customers, suppliers and communities right from the beginning. This also turns out to be a smart financial move, according to major consultancies, who find that B Corp startups have a higher survival rate than new businesses as a whole.In our time of sustained environmental and social crisis, no business can afford to ignore the effects of its products and operations—so the business world has been advised by figures as diverse as the pope and Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock. We are past the time when any business can legitimately ask its employees to leave their values and humanity at home. And no business can any longer afford to year after year pursue minor incremental efficiencies while foregoing opportunities to help reweave the social fabric and regenerate rather than deplete the health of the natural world.These three guides, sponsored by Patagonia in partnership with, variously, the Yale Center for Business and the Environment, the Yale Environmental Law Association, Vermont Law School and Caprock, are part manifesto for the B movement and part users’ guides for three separate constituencies: entrepreneurs deciding whether and when to go B. impact investors seeking a new specialty. and legislators in states and nations that have yet to pass a benefit corporation law.An Entrepreneur’s Guide to Certified B Corporations and Benefit CorporationsJust Good Business: An Investor’s Guide to B CorpsA Legislative Guide to Benefit CorporationsEach guide also makes good general reading for friends of Patagonia who want to understand the universe of companies that now operate by their values as well as their nose for good business.

          “After dinner, the round-faced, quirky old professor pulled his necklace out of his shirt,” says Sea of Miracles director, Dan Malloy. “It was a small clay flute shaped like a football. He announced that he would be performing an old Japanese protest song. The room went silent. He closed his eyes and started to play.”The ocean surrounding Iwai Island and Nagashima in Yamaguchi Prefecture’s Kaminoseki Town is home to precious and endangered creatures, such as the crested murrelet, finless porpoise and numerous rare endemic fish, shellfish and seabirds. It’s an area with many natural beaches—one that retains an atmosphere of the Inland Sea of the past. But there are plans afoot to build Japan’s newest nuclear power plant there, which would be the first one built since the Fukushima meltdown in 2011. Its construction would destroy an ancient way of life and further threaten fragile species at this potential World Heritage site.
        “This is a place of wonder, like a miracle.”
                  – Midori TakashimaPatagonia grantee and activist Midori Takashima, founder of the Kaminoseki Nature Conservation Association, along with fishermen and farmers who have been fighting construction of the plant for 35 years, continue the battle to preserve Kaminoseki’s sea and natural environment. In 2017, Patagonia Japan helped them organize stakeholders and held workshops to support their vision and further strategic planning to stop the power plant. We also produced Sea of Miracles so people around the world could learn about this tragic plan and help stop it.“The pressure bestowed on our team to make this film kept me up at night,” Dan admits. “When we departed for Japan, we had the daunting task of distilling a 35-year struggle into a 15-minute film. But that night at the dinner table, the actual task became clear. We needed to build an effective tool for a battle that was still being fought.”

          Through the Granted Film Festival, we held screening parties for Sea of Miracles at 22 Patagonia stores in four cities throughout Japan. The film significantly increased public awareness, highlighting both the accomplishments and the challenges that lie ahead. Through all of this work, a ring of support like never before is expanding to aid new efforts to stop construction of the nuclear power plant and protect this valuable area.For Dan and the Sea of Miracles crew, it was an honor to be given the opportunity to tell the story of these determined activists. “I would like to thank Midori, Toshio and all of the people of Iwai Island for letting us bear witness to their lifetime of activism and fortitude. I hope that in some small way this film helps.”

          Back in November, a group of Patagonia employees and friends from around the country came together in Yosemite National Park to have some important and difficult conversations about diversity, equity and inclusion. The bottom line: We can, and should, be doing a lot more to actively engage with individuals and communities who are historically underrepresented in the outdoor community, the environmental movement and our own company.While Patagonia has a history of championing gender equality, we also realize our own shortcomings when it comes to being more inclusive. We are working deliberately to create meaningful change by conversing with and listening to the communities we do not represent adequately. We know we’ll make mistakes, and probably upset some people along the way, but our 40-plus years of building the best products while caring for the earth has taught us that doing the right thing takes time and practice.Here are a few captures and quotes from the weekend. Through these conversations we saw that if we act together we can grow the number of advocates for the planet and increase equity and justice, not just within Patagonia but within the outdoor industry and the environmental movement at large. We look forward to sharing more as we put our words into action.“This is a short glimpse of our time together in Yosemite where we gathered with folks from across the country who are working on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) to discuss what Patagonia can do to help move the conversation into action. We spent three days together, in service to the park and in meaningful conversation around efforts of DEI by Patagonia, a brand I felt could help lead the charge in the outdoor industry. We walked away with not only renewed hope, but new friendships and possibilities of future collaborations.” —Teresa Baker, Founder of African American Nature and Parks ExperienceA gathering for good in Yosemite Valley. We are grateful to Teresa Baker (center, green jacket) for challenging us to do better and helping to organize this important event. Photo: Eugénie Frerichs“At The Avarna Group, we always start with definitions. Without a collective understanding of what diversity, equity and inclusion mean, how they’re different from each other and how they support one another, we might all be saying the same words but have a different understanding of what they all mean. Diversity means the differences between us, based on which we may experience disadvantages or encounter barriers. Inclusion is celebrating, valuing and amplifying perspectives, voices and values that have been disadvantaged and/or marginalized. Equity is an approach to ensuring that everyone has equal access to the same opportunities. it recognizes and addresses power dynamics.” —Ava Holliday, Founding Partner of The Avarna GroupAva Holliday and Patagonia ambassador Leah Evans, founder of Girls Do Ski. Photo: Eugénie Frerichs“Use business to inspire” is embedded in the center of our mission for a reason. If we only make change in our bubble at Patagonia, and don’t inspire change for a greater good outside the company, then we have not lived up to the full extent of our reason for being. Not only do we need to make more progress on how we include and bring more historically underrepresented groups in to Patagonia, we need to do it in a way that broadens who we experience wild places with and builds a more representative community of stewards who will keep those places protected for the generations to come.”  —Dean Carter, Patagonia Vice President of Human Resources and Shared ServicesDean Carter (center). Photo: Eugénie FrerichsKenji Haroutunian (Kenji Consults, Access Fund) and Len Necefer (Natives Outdoors) brought their unique urban and multicultural outdoor stories to Yosemite to share with the team from Patagonia. The retreat included difficult discussions about how First Nations people are treated like they’re invisible, and the hard work that’s necessary to actively recruit, retain and support people from diverse backgrounds in a globally relevant organization. Kenji and Len both had heartfelt and meaningful stories to tell from the perspectives of the outdoor industry and a community with centuries of experience in caring for wild places.“Being new to the outdoor industry I knew that I needed to cultivate friendships and find mentors in order to be an effective advocate for indigenous people. I was so fortunate to have met Kenji Haroutunian at a panel at Outdoor Retailer in July. Little did I realize at the time that we would become close friends and share many of the same passions. The work that Kenji has done to increase diversity, equity and inclusion in the outdoor industry has allowed me to have a seat at the table.” —Len NeceferKenji Haroutunian and Len Necefer. Photo: Kenji Haroutunian“I had the opportunity to get a true sense of who we are and what we stand for firsthand. To be perfectly candid, one of the first things I noticed when I stepped foot on campus was that no one looked like me. Even in the outdoor industry as a whole, I don’t see much diversity or inclusivity. This retreat allowed me to meet some of the most incredible people who are often left out or are underrepresented in the outdoors. It reinforced the reasons why diversity and inclusion are so important. If we want to keep our public lands alive, it should be a priority that we represent and include everyone in the outdoors, especially as our country evolves. I am so thankful to Patagonia for allowing me to be a part of this experience.” —Rahni Ragins, Ecommerce Project Manager at PatagoniaRahni Ragins. Photo: Liz O’Donnell

Shelton spoke about his experiences in both Yellowstone and Yosemite as an African American ranger and why it’s important that people in the outdoor industry start to lend their voices to the work of DEI.” —Teresa BakerRanger Shelton Johnson.

As Expedition Denali, this team of friends, leaders and champions for the environment set out to change the face of the mountain and the outdoors. During her time as director of diversity, equity and inclusion at NOLS, Aparna Rajagopal-Durbin led and nurtured this monumental project.

          We started developing our social responsibility program in the mid-1990s, working side by side with factory partners. In 2001, we became a founding member of the Fair Labor Association, a nonprofit that works to improve working conditions worldwide.With over a decade of close focus on our cut-and-sew factories, in 2011, we moved one link back in the supply chain to audit labor practices in the mills that make our fabrics. After joining Fair Trade USA’s apparel program in 2014—an effort that required us to change our internal procedures and work across many departments to embed the Fair Trade principles—we launched a successful pilot of 10 Fair Trade styles in the fall of that year.This year marks a giant step forward as we grow our Fair Trade numbers to 480 styles and 14 factories. The effort has been worthwhile because now 15,700 factory workers are directly benefiting from every Patagonia Fair Trade purchase, and the factories we work with can scale their Fair Trade production when other brands sign on.

          How Fair Trade Makes an ImpactHelena Barbour, Patagonia’s Vice President of Global Sportswear, is one of the driving forces behind the Fair Trade USA (FTUSA) partnership and the ongoing initiative to steadily increase the number of Fair Trade products at Patagonia. We spoke with her to get some insight into the early steps she took to usher in this company-wide change.Why did you want to create a Fair Trade apparel line?In early 2014, I visited several factories in Sri Lanka with our production team. It reminded me that although we purchase clothes based on fabric and fit in the store, the people who make our clothes are a huge part of the equation and are often forgotten. Most people—including myself—know very little about the people who make their clothing.I came back wanting to do something, and after a colleague mentioned Fair Trade USA were in the early stages of partnering with apparel companies, was hopeful that this could be a tangible solution to empowering workers and recognizing them.FTUSA has long been associated with coffee and chocolate and already had programs in place. They provided the link between what I saw in the factories and how we could make further improvements. And in terms of the opportunity to scale, I knew that we could use the sportswear product line to amplify the really good work our Social Responsibility team was already doing in our factories.FTUSA has also spent decades working to fight poverty in the nonprofit sector and has learned through experience what motivates and inspires workers. One of the most empowering aspects of the FTUSA program is that a brand pays a premium to a workers fund, and through a democratic process, workers decide how to spend the money. By making workers central figures in financial decision-making, it creates a true sense of partnership.Because we were able to work with FTUSA, everything happened quite quickly and it was a matter of months before we had a program in place. We were able to launch 10 styles in June, 2014.What happened next?We weren’t sure what to expect, but early on we realized the benefits extended way beyond just paying premiums directly to workers. It opened up constructive dialogue between workers and management, and engaged workers directly in making collective decisions about how to use premiums.Still, it was not a clear path, especially since we were the first apparel company to dramatically scale Fair Trade across multiple factories and regions. The concept seemed like a win-win for the factory and workers so it was hard to anticipate some of the trepidation expressed by factory owners. Their questions made us look even harder at the Fair Trade program and actually helped us gain more confidence in the work we were about to do.Sometimes the factory owners would ask, “Why don’t you just pay us more and we’ll pay workers more?” But having a third party like Fair Trade USA monitoring the program was important. We can’t just say to our customers, “We’re doing the right thing,” and expect them to blindly trust us. But those early rough patches ended up opening up many dialogues between workers and managers, which in itself was another type of success.How did workers choose to use the Fair Trade premiums?For me, that was when the program really came alive. We have seen the premiums used in a variety of ways, from water filters in every workers home to a cash bonus at the end of the year. But what was surprising was that it wasn’t always an obvious benefit that served the majority.For example, in Sri Lanka the workers voted on a daycare center, which serves mothers and fathers with young children in the factory. While not every worker will benefit from this directly, as a whole, the workforce felt it was worthwhile to have a program that helped parents maintain their jobs, which in the end, benefits everyone at the factory. The way the premiums are used take on the character of the people participating in the program. It’s not a cookie-cutter solution, which is a really great thing.What are some of the broader implications of Fair Trade?Again, it goes back to recognizing the people who make our apparel. Brands have a lot of power. Factory workers don’t. Being able to work in safe conditions and to have a voice in the workplace is hugely empowering. Also, the majority of factory workers are women, and every woman deserves the right to feel financially empowered. Fair Trade is one of several programs we are using to meet and elevate our commitment to social responsibility.What would you say to someone who doesn’t know anything about Fair Trade?Of course most people recognize that their clothing is made out of materials, but it’s important to understand that it’s also made by hands. And the people who make our clothing deserve to be seen and recognized. Fair Trade is one way to achieve that goal. It’s so much more than just paying premiums to workers. It positively affects workers lives, but also factories, brands and customers who get to make informed choices. It’s about a journey together to change the way we think about our clothing and the people behind it.

          Creating a More Equitable Global EconomySince launching Fair Trade USA in 1998 (in a one-room converted warehouse in Oakland, California), Paul Rice has helped build a vibrant global movement to change the way goods are produced, traded and consumed. We spoke with him about his early steps with Fair Trade USA and his goals for the future.Why is there a need for Fair Trade products?First, we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Globalization is already happening. The lowering of trade barriers over the last 20 or 30 years has led to a dramatic increase of trade, and with that, economic growth. Unfortunately, the benefits of globalization are not trickling down to the world’s poorest people. Literally billions of people are being left behind.How does Fair Trade help with that?In addition to creating rigorous social, environmental and economic standards to improve working conditions and protect the environment, we’re using a market-based approach that uses the power of companies and consumers to create sustainable solutions to some really challenging problems.How did you get started in Fair Trade? I got started fresh out of college. I wanted to be involved in international development, so in 1983 I bought a one-way ticket to Nicaragua to work with farmers. I worked on several well-intentioned projects funded by international aid that aimed to alleviate poverty. They were all top-down, charity-driven programs. All of them failed. I developed a belief that they failed because we didn’t figure out how to develop the farmers’ own capacity to solve their own problems. The farmers didn’t want our charity. They just wanted a decent return for all their hard work.What was your “light bulb” moment?I was pretty disillusioned with charity work and was about to bail and head back to the U.S. Then around 1990 I heard about these crazy people in Europe called “Fair Traders.” They were offering a dramatically higher price if we could just get our coffee farmers organized and sell directly to them. It was such a simple, powerful concept based on trade, not aid, and a fair price for a great product. I got 24 braves souls to sign up. We went from getting ten cents to $1.26 for a pound of coffee.Soon we had over 3,000 families signed up. It was a transformational moment for me. I realized that we could use the market as a powerful force for good. In essence, a new model for capitalism. All of a sudden families were able to eat three times a day instead of two times a day. Schools were being built. There was also an increase of hope, pride and self-confidence—what I call the “invisible dividends.”Can you explain how Fair Trade works?One of the most important aspects of the Fair Trade movement is that we go beyond social auditing and compliance. We know that model is broken. An outside auditor coming into a factory doesn’t really understand what’s going on. We know problems are still there and this approach doesn’t do enough. There’s a role for it, but it’s not enough.That’s why we provide workers and management with compliance training so everyone knows their rights and can be involved in enforcing standards. Beyond that there needs to be some type of incentive to do the work and become a Fair Trade factory. That’s where premiums come in. It’s a way to address the deepest problems, while also rewarding responsible production.For every Fair Trade Certified™ product sold, the company pays an additional premium that goes directly into a worker-managed account. The workers decide how to spend every dollar, based on what their greatest needs are. It could be scholarships, community projects or medical care. They can also vote to take the premium as a cash bonus.When did you start offering Fair Trade certification in the apparel Industry?We spent several years developing a certification model specific to the apparel industry, and then officially launched in 2010. Even though the factory program is different from our roots in agriculture, the basic premise remains the same: If you buy a Fair Trade product, you can reach halfway across the world and help a family create a better life for themselves and their community.What have you learned about your approach to businesses?I’m a mission-driven guy and I’ve found a lot of like-minded mission-driven leaders in corporate America. More often than not Fair Trade appeals to the values of executives, but unfortunately some, but not all, have had to check their values at the door. I spend a lot of time taking CEOs to the places where products are made, to show them the true power that their company and their customers have to transform lives. This experience is always a game changer.How does the customer fit into all of this?This whole thing hinges on customers purchasing products, whether it’s a chocolate bar or a fleece sweater. We’re essentially asking them to be our allies. They are at the heart of our theory of change. Just like Fair Trade premiums are empowering in communities, the purchasing act is also empowering. Conscience consumers have the power to affect change, especially when they feel like the government isn’t serving their interests in a particular area.Where do you think all of this is heading?I see a new model of globalization that’s emerging and growing very rapidly. Fair Trade proves that you can eliminate the conflict between profitability and sustainability. If we can combine this idea of doing the right thing and supporting company profitability, then we’ve hitched ourselves to the most powerful force around.This story first appeared in the October 2017 Patagonia catalog.Visit patagonia.com/fairtradeclothing to see the entire collection.

          In June 2016, we provided a comprehensive update on Patagonia’s work to investigate the emerging issue of ocean pollution from tiny fibers, which often originate from synthetic textiles (such as nylon, acrylic or polyester) that are used in products available to consumers around the world.Research about microplastics pollution is just starting to emerge among scientists and our industry, but the shedding of microfibers from synthetic garments is a real concern. We’re taking it seriously—committing significant resources to learn more about the scope of the problem and develop an understanding of what steps we can take to help create impactful solutions. Since last summer, we’ve taken more important steps to research the problem and some new actions to address key contributing factors, and we wanted to give you a full update.Some fundamental learnings have guided our approach so far and must inform everyone’s work moving forward:Microfibers found in our oceans can originate from a wide variety of textiles (such as nylon, polyester, rayon, acrylic or spandex)—everything from running shorts to yoga pants to fleece jackets and more—which shows the need for engagement on this issue by the entire apparel industry and through all steps in the product life cycle.Apparel products are not the only source of microplastic particles that are entering the oceans. Other industries are also contributing to this problem, as are things like fishing nets, bottle caps, packaging and plastics bags that break down in the ocean. A key research priority moving forward is to quantify the magnitude of the contribution of the various sources of microplastics to oceans.Garments of a higher quality shed less in the wash than low-quality synthetic products, illustrating the importance for manufacturers and consumers alike to invest in gear built to last.Our washing machines represent an integral step in the path to pollution—so we’ve centered our testing on common appliances found in many homes. And wastewater treatment plants filter a good amount of microfibers (65–92 percent) but still release a significant volume of waste into the environment. So we plan to bring our findings to the appliance industry and waste operators as well.At Patagonia, we start with the knowledge that everything we produce comes at a cost to the environment. We then work continuously to lower the environmental and social costs of our products at every phase of their life cycle—from improving our manufacturing processes at every level of the supply chain to increasing our use of recycled and natural materials to encouraging reuse, repair and recycling among our customers.When making choices about where best to invest in solutions, we seek complete information to guide decision making and we aim carefully for the areas where we can make the biggest overall impact, knowing the business of making and selling consumer products always comes with certain costs. In particular, we invest in quality—because keeping a garment in use longer, which prevents the need to put it in a landfill and replace it with a new one, beats every other improvement we could possibly make.Over the past two years, the shedding of microfibers from Patagonia’s synthetic garments has taken on heightened urgency in how we consider our priorities moving forward. We’ve been working on several fronts, including:Investigating ways to minimize fiber shedding by improving fabric constructionSupporting scientists working to gain a better understanding of the types and sources of microfibers and their ecological and public health impactsInvesting in innovative organizations working to address marine plastics pollutionCommunicating proactively with our customers and the broader publicOur goals include: better understanding our own impacts, contributing to the larger body of early research currently under way and, ultimately, finding ways to improve our practices in response to more knowledge.The Need for More ResearchWhen we convened a group of scientists, academics and public advocates at our headquarters in Ventura to discuss microplastics pollution with our leadership team, a clear consensus emerged at the end of a long, fascinating day: There’s a lot we don’t know. So we’ve taken on a leading role in support of researchers working on the topic, to inform clearheaded decision making by everyone: the apparel and appliance industries, waste operators, other researchers, the media and more.Specifically, we’ve initiated two scientific research studies. The first, which we highlighted on our blog when it was first published in June 2016 by researchers at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara, helped us better measure the extent of microfibers shedding from Patagonia products in the wash (and compare the results to lower-quality gear as well).
            Fibers captured on a 20 micron filter. A micron (or micrometer) equals one millionth of a meter (a centimeter is one hundredth of a meter). The fibers were captured by filtering washing machine effluent after washing a Patagonia jacket. The scale in the photo indicates the length of 1,000 microns.

          The second study, which has only just begun, is being conducted in partnership with North Carolina State University with the goals of better understanding characteristics in fibers and fabrics that lead to microfiber release and developing a rapid test method to assess the potential of fabrics to shed during laundering—both of which will help Patagonia and our industry conduct R&D for new materials moving forward. We plan to share the results of this second body of work as soon as it’s completed.Going forward, significant further research is still needed to understand the various sources of microfibers in aquatic environments, the extent to which microplastics may harm the ocean ecosystems, and also how any microfibers ingested by sea creatures consumed by humans may impact human health. We need this information both for direct application into our work and so we can properly assess this issue among the broader context of many urgent environmental concerns demanding our attention in the coming years, including climate change.New Plans to Educate CustomersIn addition to further research, we’re taking a more active role in educating our customers about what we’ve learned so far about microfibers entering the ocean—and, most importantly, what they can do to help right now.In the coming weeks we’ll begin providing every customer who purchases a synthetic item from our retail stores or patagonia.com with clear information about how to care for any synthetic garment—not just ours—to limit the shedding of microfibers in the wash and keeping what does shed out of the ocean. Most people tend to own a lot of clothing from all kinds of brands. This will help ensure everyone understands how they can help keep microfibers out of the ocean, even as we continue to learn more about the issue and how it may impact the environment and human health. In addition to wash tips, we will remind our customers of the importance of purchasing high quality, durable garments as one of several strategies for minimizing shedding in the laundering process.Here’s a look at what we’ll be sharing with our customers.***As you take ownership of your new garment it’s important to remember that everything we buy comes at a cost to the environment. The team at Patagonia has been studying the shedding of tiny fibers from synthetic garments in the wash. The science is just emerging, but we know these microfibers can make their way to the ocean. These simple steps will help reduce the environmental impact of your gear throughout its lifetime.Keep Using It: Keeping our gear in use longer is something we can all do to reduce our personal impact on the planet. Buy only what you need, buy high quality and make it last. In Patagonia’s recent study with researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, a low-quality, generic-brand fleece shed significantly more over its lifespan than Patagonia’s high-quality products (brenmicroplastics.weebly.com).Wash Less Often & Invest in a Front-load Washer: Microfibers shed in the wash—so wash your gear only when it’s absolutely necessary (you’ll conserve water in the process). Even your most-used outerwear should only need a full wash occasionally. If it’s caked with dirt (and we hope it will be), consider using a rag or sponge to spot clean rather than putting it through a machine cycle. And consider your washing machine: Studies show synthetic jackets laundered in top-load washing machines shed approximately seven times as many microfibers as the same jacket in front-load washers.Fiber Filters Help: Putting your synthetic clothing into a filter bag before washing by hand or machine can significantly reduce the flow of microfibers into your drain. Starting in the coming weeks, you can buy the easy-to-use Guppy Friend at patagonia.com throughout the United States and Europe. Or install a permanent washing machine filter (requires some plumbing expertise), like Wexco’s Filtrol 160 (septicsafe.com/washing-machine-filter).You can read more about our work on this issue by visiting patagonia.com (www.patagonia.com/blog/tag/microfibers). As always, let us know if you have questions about these guidelines or anything about your gear. Thanks for your support!***In the coming weeks, Patagonia will begin offering customers in the United States and Europe an inexpensive new hand- and machine-washing bag that acts as a microfiber filter between your synthetic clothing and the drain. The Guppy Friend will be sold in Patagonia retail stores and online throughout the United States and Europe starting in the coming weeks. In Patagonia’s internal testing, its use resulted in a significant reduction in microfiber mass making its way into the wastewater stream.

          The Guppy Friend was developed by a partner of ours in Germany, and we’re also supporting further refinement of the product with a €100,000 grant.Advanced R&D and MoreIn addition to new research and customer education, we’ve tested additional consumer laundering solutions (including Wexco’s Filtrol 160, a highly effective washing machine filter) and are looking forward to the Rozalia Project’s microfiber catcher ball becoming available to customers later this year. We have been helping to initiate collaborative discussions about the microplastics issue within our industry (primarily in concert with the Outdoor Industry Association), and providing grants to nonprofit organizations working to bring awareness to the issue of ocean microplastics (totaling $180,000 in the past five years).In our fabric lab, we’ve continued our aggressive ongoing research and development activities in search of new biobased fabrics (long-term, we’re looking at truly biodegradable solutions for fibers and packaging). This work isn’t in response to the issue of microplastics pollution (in the past it’s produced innovations like plant-based wetsuits and advancements in our use of organically grown cotton). But it’s a critical component if we aim to build synthetic materials that shed less and offer our customers more technical apparel made from natural fabrics.(When considering alternatives to synthetic clothing, however, it’s important to acknowledge there is no material that does not come with environmental and social costs—only trade-offs. Our goal is always to find ways to do less harm, while giving you tools to make it easier to keep your stuff in use longer.)We’ve also invested in a waterless textile processing company called Tersus Solutions through Tin Shed Ventures, our in-house investment fund. The closed-loop nature of Tersus’ technology allows microfibers to be captured within the system rather than flushing microfibers into our waterways. Tersus machines are already being used in commercial laundering operations, and we hope their innovations will continue to reduce the prevalence of microfibers in wastewater over time.We’re going to continue to focus on this emerging issue to gain a more complete picture of the important concerns surrounding microplastic ocean pollution and understand our best chances for leading the way toward real solutions. As we gain a more complete understanding of the problem, we’ll become better equipped to consider microplastic pollution within the entire scope of environmental and social challenges where we have an opportunity to make a positive impact—and to make clear, informed decisions as a result.We’ll keep our customers, our partners and the public closely posted along the way.Updated 6/22/17: Changed top imageUpdated 5/8/18: Corrected stats for front-load washers

'Instead of putting the money back into our business, we’re responding by putting $10 million back into the planet. Our home planet needs it more than we do.'Somehow I missed this in November, but hey, even if it is not brand new news, it's still impressive six months later. The better-late-than-never story goes like this: The outdoor clothing company, Patagonia, donated its $10 million dollar tax-cut windfall into ""groups committed to protecting air, land and water and finding solutions to the climate crisis."" While President Trump said that the corporate tax breaks – the most sweeping U.S. corporate tax cut ever enacted – would boost the economy when corporations invested those tax breaks in executive bonuses and new yachts their workers, Patagonia had another idea altogether.The announcement was made in a letter by Rose Marcario, CEO of Patagonia, published on November 28, 2018 in LinkedIn. I am including the letter in its entirety here:""Our Urgent Gift to the PlanetBased on last year’s irresponsible tax cut, Patagonia will owe less in taxes this year—$10 million less, in fact. Instead of putting the money back into our business, we’re responding by putting $10 million back into the planet. Our home planet needs it more than we do.Our home planet is facing its greatest crisis because of human-caused climate disruption. All the extra heat we’ve trapped in the earth’s atmosphere is not only melting the poles and raising sea levels, it’s intensifying drought and accelerating the extinction of species. The most recent Climate Assessment report puts it in stark terms: the U.S. economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars, and the climate crisis is already affecting all of us. Mega-fires. Toxic algae blooms. Deadly heat waves and deadly hurricanes. Far too many have suffered the consequences of global warming in recent months, and the political response has so far been woefully inadequate—and the denial is just evil.We have always paid our fair share of federal and state taxes. Being a responsible company means paying your taxes in proportion to your success and supporting your state and federal governments, which in turn contribute to the health and well-being of civil society. Taxes fund our important public services, our first responders and our democratic institutions. Taxes protect the most vulnerable in our society, our public lands and other life-giving resources. In spite of this, the Trump administration initiated a corporate tax cut, threatening these services at the expense of our planet.We recognize that our planet is in peril. We are committing all $10 million to groups committed to protecting air, land and water and finding solutions to the climate crisis. We have always funded grassroots activism, and this $10 million will be on top of our ongoing 1% for the Planet giving. It will go a long way toward funding grassroots groups. including those dedicated to regenerative organic agriculture, which may be our greatest hope for reversing the damage done to our overheated planet.In this season of giving, we are giving away this tax cut to the planet, our only home, which needs it now more than ever.""According to Forbes, most of the money saved from corporate tax cuts went ""first, to companies’ bottom lines and second to stock buybacks, which were recently at a record high."" Not the workers or investing in the business? Hmm. Forbes continues, ""Buybacks are attractive because most CEO pay is directly linked to stock values and not to productive capital expansion.""Some may kvetch that Patagonia should have given the windfall back to its workers, but to be fair, the company is already known for being especially generous to its employees. After all, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard titled his memoir, “Let My People Go Surfing.” And even Glassdoor, which is usually a catalog of complaints, has few gripes by former and current workers. And really, what good is a pay raise when biodiversity is crashing and the planet is cooking?So I say bravo to Patagonia, even if it's a little late. Here's to owning the Republicans, one saved planet at a time.

          “Forget Mars,” Yvon Chouinard said recently—although, come to think of it, he might have used a stronger f-word. Our founder was responding to a glib idea that comes up from time to time in conversations about the climate crisis—that if we exhaust the Earth as a habitat for humans, we’ll all just up and move to the red planet. Chouinard, and Patagonia, would rather not, and are more determined than ever to save our home planet. In a recent interview for Patagonia’s 2018 Environmental and Social Initiatives book (published this week), Chouinard shared how our company continues to do what it can to defend the soil, air and water we all depend on—and to confront the greatest threat to our welfare we’ve ever faced.Brad Wieners: Last year, when the total of Patagonia grants to grassroots organizations topped $100 million, it seemed like there was a reluctance to go public with that, maybe because the company has never been one to boast about its numbers.Yvon Chouinard: Oh, I’m not reluctant at all. I think we should be proud of that because it demonstrates what a company can do, and not just what its shareholders can do once they’ve collected on their investment and decided how to give away some of the proceeds. Our grants were given as we conducted business.Patagonia continues to give directly to activists. As the company has grown, have you considered changing that?We always thought the activists were the ones who needed the money most. There’s plenty of funding for science, but science without activism is dead science. And activists struggle to get funding because everybody’s afraid they’ll do something radical. Companies, especially, see them as risky, and not worth the trouble. So we thought: Let somebody else do the science. Let somebody else do large-scale conservation projects. We’ll fund the activists. And that’s what we’ve done.If anything has changed, it’s that we’ve started producing movies like DamNation. We could have given money to international organizations that work on dams, but I felt like we could do a better job if we made a movie ourselves. And that proved to be true: DamNation wasn’t another environmental film that went nowhere. It really got around.I’ve always said that all of us, in our own way, according to what resources we have, must do something to confront evil. At Patagonia, we have all these resources—we have better marketing expertise than most any environmental organization out there—and yet we were giving money away to other people to do the marketing on issues we care about. Why not use more of our own expertise? That’s what got us into the film business. We’re a film company now.I really want us to face up to the fact that we’re destroying the planet. It could very well end up uninhabitable in 80 years, at least for humankind and wild animals. That’s why we recently changed the company’s mission statement to “We’re in business to save our home planet.”Photo: Jim RichardsonThat’s it, then, “We’re in business to save our home planet”?Simple as that. I’m 80 now, and I’ve been asking myself why I still come into work. And it’s not to sell more clothes or to make more money. It’s because we’re destroying the planet, and it’s gotten so dire that we have to do something. When you talk to new people at our company, you’ll find that this is why they come here, too: because they’re committed to saving the planet.Aside from hiring those who feel the same urgency, how do you see the company further embracing this commitment? We’ve come to the conclusion that the best thing we can possibly do is support regenerative agriculture. I don’t know of anything else that can really solve global warming. Sure, we could try to stop using fossil fuels. Good luck with that. Good luck with going against Exxon and all those big energy companies. We’d end up spending a lot of money doing effectively nothing if we tried to take them on. Instead, what we’re learning about capturing carbon with agriculture is encouraging. See, with organic agriculture, you remove all the harmful chemicals, but that’s about it. With regenerative agriculture, you’re able to grow more nutritious, better-tasting food. you’re growing topsoil. and you’re capturing carbon—so it’s a way of farming that’s a win-win-win-win situation. I see it as a real positive solution. It’s our best hope.

          Can regenerative agriculture really trap enough carbon in the soil to counter the greenhouse effect?Well, according to studies completed by the University of California and the French government, it can. They think that if we changed over to regenerative agriculture on a broad scale, we could more than capture all the carbon we are producing—more than all of it. And we’re not leaving it to other people to do something about it. At Patagonia, we’re writing a plan and we’re investing in a pilot program.Patagonia’s adopted a pair of progressive benchmarks for cleaning up its own act. One was becoming a B Corp in 2011. Has that been worthwhile?Yes. It hasn’t caught on as much as I’d hoped, but it does provide a framework. We’ve heard from other businesses that it’s helped them, too. When we started looking into a lot of this, there weren’t many places to go for help. Now there are some pretty good ones.

          What about the Higg Index, which the company uses to assess social and environmental issues in the supply chain?The index helps us stay on track, but I’m disappointed that bigger companies haven’t done more. When we started down that road in 2007, everyone was talking about “sustainability,” and now that word is basically meaningless.Given how daunting the climate crisis is, it’s going to take lots of different actors to change course, including the government. Do you see Patagonia working more with the government to save the planet?We can’t rely on this government. The current administration is evil. All they want to do is destroy the planet for profit. You’re not going to change their minds. You’ll just beat your head against a wall. You know, I don’t make a very good martyr. I really think we just have to get them out of there.As a company we’re going to spend more on political policy, but for me it’s a waste of money compared to what we could be doing on the causes, instead of the symptoms, of global warming. We’re also committed to cleaning up our own act and have already begun to make the changes necessary so that by 2025 we will eliminate, capture or otherwise offset all of the carbon emissions we create. This includes not just our offices or stores, but all of the emissions from the factories that make our textiles and finished clothing and farms that grow our natural fibers. Eventually, we want to remove more carbon from the air than we put out.When we first started giving money away, we knew that we were doing harm to the planet, but we didn’t know that we were totally destroying the planet—and destroying it very, very quickly. What I really want to get across is that we’re in an all-hands-on-deck type of situation. What’s at stake is not only the future of some endangered species or large mammals. it’s the future of humankind. And it’s gonna happen within people’s lifetimes. It’s a whole different scenario now. So let’s get on it.This is an abridged version of this interview.

          Welcome to Patagonia’s Repair Center, where we’ll do just about anything to keep your gear in play.We love fixing gear that’s been worn into near oblivion by our customers. It means we did our job (build beautiful product for years of hard use) and you did yours (play like hell). In our 40 years of business, we’ve learned that, on average, people keep a piece of clothing for just three years, yet the materials and processes of making any new garment—including ours, which are made with the strictest sustainability considerations in the apparel industry—are very costly to the planet. The best way to reduce the environmental footprint of your clothes is to keep them in use longer, by you or by someone else.Repairing clothes is hardly a new idea—go back just a couple of generations, when getting more life out of what you owned was the necessary norm for most of the world. In much of today’s world, however, clothing is seen as disposable. The average adult disposes of 70 pounds of apparel into the landfill each year—an appalling number by any standard, especially when you consider that keeping a piece of clothing for just nine more months can reduce that product’s associated CO2 emissions by 27 percent, its water use by 33 percent and its waste by 22 percent. Simply put, the longer we use our stuff, the smaller the impacts become.Before and after: Andrea Downard gives new life to a down jacket. Photo: Ken Etzel

          At Patagonia, we want to keep the clothes we make in circulation for as long as possible. Not only is durability built into the design of every product, we’re prepared to help extend the life of your gear. Our Repair Center is housed in our Distribution Center in Reno, Nevada. It’s one of the largest apparel repair facilities in the United States, with 42 full-time repair technicians. According to repairs manager Josh Schill, the Repair Center currently keeps upward of 50,000 well-loved, hard-worn pieces out of the landfill, putting them back out into circulation for more use. Each one receives personalized attention, because while every repair may be different, the sentiment of our customers is largely the same: “Please fix this. I can’t go on without it.”The average repair takes about an hour and a half. Some take far longer, and complicated repairs take longer still. Patagonia repair technicians are skilled sewers from diverse backgrounds: Many have worked in factories in other countries or in the apparel industry in Los Angeles, some have learned their craft on their home sewing machine. Repair techs start on simpler repairs and progress to more involved jobs. “It’s a four- to six-month learning curve for a technician to be solid on 70 percent of what we do here,” says Schill. “The hardest repairs tend to be on specialty stuff like wheeled luggage or bootie alterations on fishing waders, and not everyone takes those repairs on.” But whatever the scale, techs make it a personal mission to get a piece fixed and back to its owner within about 10 business days.Used pieces may also be traded for credit into the Worn Wear program (sometimes after being repaired). All eligible Worn Wear items are laundered in a waterless, liquid CO2 washing machine—an ingenious closed-loop system that captures plastics that would otherwise end up in the ocean—and require no drying. They’re then photographed and put on wornwear.com, where someone can purchase a pre-loved piece of Patagonia gear.And then, there are the items that are simply beyond repair. With the customer’s permission, we’ll bale and prep those for recycling. Of course, if the customer can’t bear to see it go, we’ll send the piece back to them. (We get it.)

Susan was base camp support for a 1987 Cho Oyu expedition (her children’s father was on the climbing team from Nevada) and still has her original Chouinard Expedition Sewing Kit, which she used to repair a tent flap that was ripped to shreds in a windstorm and to fix gaiters for one of the team members.

          “Ultimately, Patagonia’s goal is to keep as much as we can out of the landfill,” says Stacy Weaver, Worn Wear operations coordinator in Reno. “We’ll do that any way that we can: repair, repurpose, upcycle, recycle. Patagonia’s quality standards are so high that even the stuff that’s been worn has so much life left in it. There are so many ways a garment can live on, why waste it?”This story first appeared in the January 2018 Patagonia Catalog.

          Addressing the shedding of microfibers from synthetic garments continues to be a top priority for us at Patagonia. We know there are a lot of contributing factors to microplastic pollution, and we have been learning all we can about the release of fibers from our garments.Patagonia has commissioned two research projects on microplastics—one through the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara (Bren) and a second study with North Carolina State University (NC State), which concluded this year. The Bren research project gave us a basic understanding of how much garments shed and how the type of washing machine used, the age of garment and the quality of fabric used in a garment affects shedding during wash. The NC State project focused on providing guidance on what should be included in a standardized test method to use to quantify microfiber shedding during laundering. Although further research is necessary, these studies have given us a better understanding about our contributions to the issue.We will continue to work with other apparel brands and the marine science community to understand better what the fibers found in the ocean are made of and determine if they match up with the types of fibers used to make clothes. This is an important link to make in order to more accurately determine where the fibers are from and, ultimately, to take steps to prevent them from entering aquatic environments.While we learn more about microfibers, here are some things you can do to reduce the environmental impact of your gear.
            Illustration: Peter McBride/Patagonia
          When You Buy, Buy High-Quality Products: Our studies show that low-quality fleeces shed significantly more over their lifespan than high-quality products.Wash Less Often & Invest in a Front-load Washer: Microfibers shed in the wash—so wash your gear only when it’s absolutely necessary. (You’ll also conserve water.) Even your most-used outerwear should only need a full wash occasionally. If it’s caked with dirt (and we hope it will be), consider using a rag or sponge to spot clean rather than putting it through a machine cycle. And consider your washing machine: Studies show synthetic jackets laundered in top-load washing machines shed approximately seven times as many microfibers as the same jackets in front-load washers.Fiber Filters Help: Putting your synthetic clothing into a filter bag before washing by hand or machine can significantly reduce the flow of microfibers into your drain. The easy-to-use GuppyFriend Washing Bag is now available at patagonia.com and our stores throughout the United States and Europe. Another option is a permanent washing machine filter (requires some plumbing expertise), like Wexco’s Filtrol 160.To learn more about our work on this issue, please read our previous blog posts. As always, let us know if you have questions about these guidelines or anything about your gear.Updated 5/8/18: Corrected stats for front-load washers

          Patagonia surf ambassador Mary Osborne recently completed a month-long sailing trip to study plastic pollution in the South Atlantic with a team from the non-profit 5 Gyres Institute. Together with their partners, Pangaea Explorations and Algalita Marine Research Foundation, 5 Gyres’ mission is to conduct research and communicate about the global impact of plastic pollution in the world’s oceans and employ strategies to eliminate the accumulation of plastic pollution in the five subtropical gyres. 
Mary was invited to participate in the South Atlantic Gyre leg of the project along with 12 other scientists, journalists, and activists. For Mary, the opportunity to study plastic pollution really hit home, “It is sad to say, but I have seen plastic pollution on almost every beach I have been fortunate enough to travel to: Indonesia, Seychelles, Mexico, France, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Europe, Panama, Maldives, and even my own home town in Ventura County.” Today, we’re pleased to share some of Mary’s logs from this important, and sometimes difficult, trip. [All photos courtesy of 5 Gyres Institute.]
November 16, 2010One Week at SeaThe hot Brazilian sun reflects off my pale skin. I am extremely nervous, yet utterly excited. I have only sailed one time before in my entire life when I was a child. Waiting anxiously for the dinghy to pick me up, I see her across the bay anchored in the still waters. Her vibrant blue and white body reflects off the glassy ocean water. She is any sailors dream: strong, confident, aesthetically pleasing to the eye and sexy. Her sleek design is carefully hand crafted to cut through any type of weather Mother Nature presents. Her credibility stands above any other boat in the harbor. She is the Sea Dragon.
We did our first trawl at 250 nautical miles off the coat of Brazil. Since then we have done 8 trawls at approximately 900 nautical miles in the South Atlantic. By looking at the ocean with your bare eye one would never guess plastic exists. So far, every single trawl had pieces of plastic in it. The trawl is skimming a very tiny portion of the vast blue ocean that surrounds us. Sadly, I quickly understand how big of an issue this truly is.
We are still in route to the gyre and have at least 700 more miles to go.
November 30, 2010Present Day BluesThe wind was nonexistent, there were no birds singing and the sounds of waves crashing were thousands of miles away. We stopped the Sea Dragon to capture a few pictures of the rubbish we had collected over the last few days. I quickly suited up and jumped overboard. I assumed icy pins and needles were going to shock my entire body once the ocean touched my skin. Surprisingly, the water wasn’t nearly as cold as I imagined. It reminded me of a warm fall day in my hometown. Distant memories of swimming and surfing in Brazil flashed in my mind. It had been 20 something days since I immersed my entire body in salt water, boy did I need it.

[“My heart trembled when I realized the depth below me. It was inconceivably deep, maybe 3-5 miles, I didn’t know. This was the first time in my life swimming in such deep waters.” Photo: Jody Lemmon]
Like a priest in a confessional, the sea washed away my sins. The foul curse words my mouth projected when I bounced off Sea Dragon’s walls, the sickening thoughts that had entered my mind when I hurled over board and, most commonly, my despising feelings directed at the Captain because I was forced to wake from my happy dreams in the middle of the night for watch, all washed away with the currents beneath me. My dried out gills were flushed with forgiveness and my body was revitalized with happiness.
I glanced up at the Sea Dragon, my home for a month, looked so much bigger from the waters surface. After 25 minutes the image taken will always remind me of three important things: The past, present and future.
The past: A vision of what I saw underneath the water. a pristine, clean, untouched ocean.The present: The current state of our oceans.The future: Unknown.

[Photo from “Slimeheads and plastic in the Gyre. We’ve arrived.” on the 5 Gyres blog.]December 1, 201029 days, 29 yearsThe sea state is calm with perfectly uniformed ground swells passing beneath us. I continue to wonder where these swells are traveling. There must be waves somewhere. I close my eyes, take a breath of the pure fresh air and let my mind wander. Perhaps, there is a mystical wave somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic. Ideally, it would be a perfect right hand point break with a playground of sections on it. Nearby there would be a floating bar serving fresh margaritas, thirst quenching beers, fresh chips, salsa, guacamole and giant healthy green salads. Yummy…. My stomach began to gargle out loud.
This was just one of the many scenes I daydreamed about while laying on the bow of the boat. Today was a particularly great day. It was my birthday, but better yet it was sunny and hot out. We really haven’t had that many warm days on this crossing. Today, I could actually lay at the bow of the boat, which we nicknamed, “the beach,” and not be chilly. The beach was a great place to spot floating debris. I love going to the beach on my birthday.
By nightfall the crew had prepared one of my favorite meals, wine and cheese. This is a dry (meaning no alcohol) expedition and only on occasions we break out the goods. Try splitting a bottle of champagne and red wine 13 different ways. It wasn’t a lot, but just enough to make me smile. I savored every tiny sip and taste.
If things go as planned, it will be a total of 29 days at sea and 29 years I have been alive. I definitely will never forget this birthday.

[Photo from “Flat Seas, No Breeze and a Mountain of Trash” on the 5 Gyres blog.]December 2, 2010Gyre & PollutantsThe gyre is not what I expected. In fact, it’s not what the media has portrayed either. This so called, “Isle of Trash,” does not exist, not even close. If there were such thing as an “island of trash,” it would be a heck of a lot of easier to clean up than the current catastrophe. The 4th gyre basically sits in the high-pressure zone, in between the coast of Brazil and South Africa, and circles around accordingly with the currents. Typically, there is no wind or weather in this particular region. It is a stagnant zone, a sailor’s kryptonite. The big pieces of plastic debris are very obvious. Yet, the real problem is what lies under the sea, the tiny broken down particles of plastic debris that emulate a synthetic soup. Think of it like a massive oil spill but located in every single one of our oceans. The problem is that we have no way of absorbing the plastic like we do when it comes to an oil spill. There are no booms, giant cleaning devices or dispersants specifically designed to absorb this problem. At least we can plug the leaking hole when it comes to an oil spill, but with a plastic gyre the major difference is that as long as there are humans on this planet the spill is constantly leaking. The only way to stop the plastic from leaking is global awareness, education and sustainability.
The 5 Gyres institute is also investigating whether plastic pollution in the ocean is a vector for Persistent Organic Pollutants (also known as POPs) to enter the marine food web. They do this by analyzing plastic particles, seawater and fish for the presence of these pollutants such as DDTs (pesticides) and PCBs (flame retardants). These POPs get ingested by sea life, which get eaten by bigger sea creatures, and slowly works their way up the food chain. Scientific studies are currently being done to see how these pollutants enter our bodies and affect the human blood stream.
This is the first research expedition to study and confirm the presence of plastic marine pollution in the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. What is so unique about this expedition is the fact that we trawl every 60 miles. Trawling allows us to capture the small particles that the human eye can’t see from the surface of the water. Typically, when sorting thru a trawl we see all kinds of interesting sea creatures such as myctophids (tiny fish), blue bottle jellies, salps (gelatinous plankton), squid and crabs. The non-sea creatures are the several tiny particles of colorful plastics. Sometimes you can make out a piece of plastic, such as a bottle cap, but majority of the time the sun has broken down the plastic pieces and pieces are unrecognizable.
We can officially state that we have captured particles of plastic debris in every single trawl deployed since we departed Brazil. The plastic debris continues to get more dense as we made way to the gyre and slowly more sparse as we motor out of the gyre towards South Africa. These expeditions conducted by the 5 Gyres Institute are proving that plastic pollution truly is a global issue.

[Photo from “Rising from the Deep: Plastic!” on the 5 Gyres blog.]December 4, 201024 days at sea (I think)The Toilet Blows The days are getting longer and longer. Food is packed with carbohydrates, my clothes smell of various stinky odors and I’m hitting my wall. For some reason, today I am tired and agitated. I can’t wait to take a shower and use a toilet that isn’t in the exact same smelly zone. Never again will I take my toilet for granted. I love the fact that our toilets at home flush with the trouble-free push of a small handle. On the boat, we have to pump 15-20 times to get the pipes flushed. Majority of the time, you walk into the toilet and have to flush your roommate’s goop first because they have failed to read the simple directions posted above the head. Half the time you spend trying to flush the toilet and it doesn’t even flush. Today, I would have rather dangled off the side of the boat by a rope rather than use our toilets. It’s not that they are dirty, they get cleaned every morning. I should be thankful we even have a toilet and shower with warm water aboard the boat. Most boats I have been on rarely supply a bucket. The true problem this morning is that I used the toilet, pumped out my stuff and the toilet spit back up at me. Yes, threw up all over my jacket. Twice it spit back all over me! My favorite blue puffy down jacket is tarnished with yuck. I love puffy so much, now she is officially retired for the duration of the trip. Three more days to go….
Pray for good wind….December 6 & 7, 2010Arriving with a bangFor the last 18 hours the Atlantic has been beating us alive. As if we haven’t been tested enough morally and physically on this expedition, here we go again. With less than 300 miles to go, we are certainly going to arrive into Cape Town with a bang, literally. 30-knot winds are blowing directly at our bow. Every 2-3 minutes the bow of the boat gets lifted by a wave and quickly slammed back down. Water is flooding the deck. The ferocious ocean is awfully scary looking today. I have been gripping extra hard on the handrails when I am on watch.
Sleeping was rather impossible last night. Myself, along with several others are working on only a few hours sleep. Sea Dragon has quite the prestigious and strong reputation, I couldn’t imagine being in a smaller boat. I am starving, tired, irritable, and officially dislike sailing. We know we are close due to giant tankers passing by, various birds flying over us and of course our GPS. It is just not close enough for comfort. One more day to go….
Come on wind…. turn baby turn….

[Photo from “Land Ho!” on the 5 Gyres blog.]December 8, 2010Seas are much more calm. Wind is still not in our favor but we are currently motoring towards Cape Town. We are said to arrive this evening. I will kiss the ground…. a lot!

          The National Park Service describes Yellowstone as a “mountain wildland, home to grizzly bears, wolves, and herds of bison and elk, the park is the core of one of the last, nearly intact, natural ecosystems in the Earth’s temperate zone.” Despite Yellowstone’s gift of refuge to recovering species, two species in particular are facing increasing threats as changes occur in the way they are managed.

          Bison (Bison bison)In the 19th century, an estimated 30–60 million bison roamed the Great Plains, shaping the ecology of the landscape and playing critical roles in Native American and Western culture. By the end of that same century, irresponsible hunting and the carelessness of Americans had whittled the population down to a mere two dozen animals in Yellowstone National Park. Since then, Yellowstone has been a refuge for free-ranging bison to recover from the near extinction they faced in the 1800s, protecting them from interbreeding with cattle. In Yellowstone remain the last truly wild bison.Tourists from all over the world flock to Yellowstone to see the iconic Great Plains species. And in 2016, President Obama declared the bison our National Mammal. Despite these positive steps toward restoring wild bison, they face new threats as they grow in population and migrate outside the National Park boundaries to winter breeding grounds and new habitat.Dictated by an out-of-date 2005 Interagency Bison Management Plan (IBMP), wildlife managers have used aggressive tactics to manage the species inside and outside Yellowstone including hazing bison back into the National Park boundaries and culling the population down to just 3,000 animals yearly through a managed hunt and, often, outright slaughter. In 2016, over 600 bison were removed from the population to meet management goals and to calm fears from the livestock industry over a nonexistent threat of a bison-to-cattle disease, called brucellosis. This year, Yellowstone has proposed to cull 1,300 bison to comply with their out-of-date mandate.Despite the ongoing culling, Montana has made a slight movement to protect Yellowstone’s bison over the last year. Governor Steve Bullock expanded year-round habitat outside of Yellowstone National Park, giving bison more room to roam during winter months. The 255,000 acres of expanded habitat includes critical areas in the Gallatin National Forest and the Gardiner Basin. While this is a big step forward in some ways, it leaves much to be desired for a real long-term solution.This year, we have an important opportunity to influence how bison are managed. This summer, the 2005 Bison Management Plan is up for revision and the five partnering agencies and three tribal entities who craft it will be seeking public input into the management plan. Patagonia strongly believes that wild bison should be allowed to roam as a free wild species beyond the borders of a National Park and be integrated into the Western landscape as they once were—not as livestock for slaughter but as a wild species. We will be weighing in this summer to work toward a better management plan without the need for the current system of slaughter.We urge you to join us and help protect bison this year. Already in 2017, nearly 1,000 Yellowstone bison have been culled from their herds and sent to slaughter houses. Now more than ever, Yellowstone’s bison need our help to fight out of date and ill-conceived management practices. To learn more about how to fight for our bison, visit Buffalo Field Campaign (BFC). BFC’s primary goal is to create permanent year-round protection for bison and the ecosystem they depend on. There are a number of ways to get involved with BFC, including contacting politicians, writing letters to the editor, volunteering and attending events.

          Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos)Grizzlies once roamed over most of the West before being nearly removed from the landscape by commercial trapping, hunting, habitat loss and conflict with humans. In fact, the five remaining grizzly bear populations in all of the lower 48 today add up to perhaps 1,500, compared to the 100,000 grizzly bears that once roamed the contiguous U.S.For the last 40 years, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 has been vital to sustaining grizzly bear populations. The ESA signaled an end to the slaughter of grizzlies across the Western landscape: It stopped sport hunting, reduced availability of human garbage and foods that led to bear-human conflict, cut back grazing of domestic livestock on public lands and closed roads, giving grizzlies a chance to regain their footing and habitat. Since 1975, recovery efforts have occurred in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, the Bitterroot Ecosystem, the Selkirk/Cabinet Yaak Ecosystem and the North Cascades Ecosystem. Despite best efforts to fully recover bears in each ecosystem, recovery has been slow and often thwarted by federal and state politics. Grizzly recovery in Yellowstone has been no exception.As a result of ESA protections Yellowstone’s grizzly bears have slowly increased in number from 136 in 1975 to a current population of 650–700 bears. But that’s a far cry from the 2,000-plus animals widely considered by experts to be necessary for long-term viability in the ecosystem. As threats from climate change, industry development and human encroachment increase, now is not the time to gamble with our landscapes and iconic species like the grizzly bear.In 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) took steps to delist the Yellowstone grizzly bear from the ESA. The three states surrounding Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, Idaho and Montana) have announced intentions to sponsor trophy hunting of the bear when delisting occurs. Coupled with the alarming effects of climate change on two of the Yellowstone grizzly’s primary food sources—whitebark pine nuts and cutthroat trout—delisting would likely reverse hard-fought gains and push the bear back to the brink.While all signs were pointing toward a delisting decision to be finalized in 2016, USFWS postponed its final ruling as a result of receiving an overwhelming number of public comments. It may take them until this summer to review and address all 650,000 public comments, buying the conservation community valuable time to prepare its defense. We now anticipate a delisting decision to be finalized early this summer.Now more than ever Yellowstone’s grizzlies need our help. Patagonia strongly opposes delisting the Yellowstone grizzly bear population from the Endangered Species Act. We will be working with partners such as Park County Environmental Council, Sierra Club, Guardians of Our Ancestors Legacy and Save the Yellowstone Grizzlies to find a path forward for continued protection. We invite you to join us in this fight. Stay informed and get involved with these organizations working to protect grizzlies.This story first appeared in the Patagonia Spring 2017 catalog.

          In the wake of the decision by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to delist the grizzly, the three states around Yellowstone have announced their intentions to sponsor trophy hunting of the bear. Opponents say that the effects of climate change on food sources, in addition to their famously slow reproductive rate, coupled with a trophy hunt, would put the bears on the path to extinction.

          Led by Patagonia and Kinaʻole Capital Partners, LLC, a first-of-its-kind group of five certified B-Corporations have come together to create a $35 million tax equity fund that will make the benefits of solar power available to more than a thousand U.S. households. The new fund uses state and federal tax credits to direct Patagonia’s tax dollars for residential development of affordable, efficient Sungevity solar energy systems.The new fund builds off a similar, successful endeavor between Patagonia and Kinaʻole that was created to purchase 1,000 rooftop solar systems in Hawaiʻi in 2014. Now reaching the mainland United States, this transaction brings together five B Corporations (B Corps): Patagonia as the tax equity investor. Kinaʻole as the fund manager. New Resource Bank and Beneficial State Bank as lenders. and Sungevity, Inc., as the project developer. B Corps are for-profit companies certified by the nonprofit B Lab that meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.“We’re doubling down on an investment strategy that brings great financial returns while supporting the clean energy economy,” said Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario. “B Corps know how to make money while creating broader benefits—but any company would be smart to leverage their tax dollars this way. I hope others take advantage of a great opportunity.”The U.S. solar market, which currently employs 209,000 workers, is expected to see aggressive growth over the next five years, making the sector a prime area for investment. Solar installations are projected to reach 25 gigawatts of solar capacity, and the recent extension of the 30% federal solar investment tax credit (ITC) will foster $40 billion in incremental investment in solar between 2016 and 2020.The fund will purchase more than 1,500 residential solar energy systems to be made available to homeowners in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. Homeowners pay no up-front costs but sign power purchase agreements to buy solar energy for less than their utility’s rates (any surplus energy produced by the panels is sold back to the utility). Sungevity manages the contracts and the installations.Over a twenty-year life span (the average for a solar installation), the rooftop systems installed through the fund are expected to produce 200 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity, displacing consumption of 325,000 barrels of oil (equivalent to taking 30,000 cars off the road) and 140,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.“We’re excited to join with Patagonia to share our tax equity investment blueprint with other companies interested in making a successful return by supporting clean energy,” said Blair Herbert, Principal of Kinaʻole. “Sungevity quickly emerged as the natural partner given its strong customer experience and like-minded management team, and we’re excited to see our fund result in more residential solar over the coming years,” added Kinaʻole principal Andrew Yani.“Sungevity is proud to be a founding B Corp member and a recognized ‘Best for the World’ company,” said Andrew Birch, Chief Executive Officer, Sungevity, Inc. “This B Corp partnership clearly demonstrates that corporations can work together in creative ways to simultaneously benefit their respective bottom lines, the personal finances of homeowners and the environment.”The previous fund established by Patagonia and Kinaʻole in 2014, totaling $27 million, was developed to purchase 1,000 solar systems in Hawaiʻi. The program has already successfully helped many homeowners and individual condominium residents enjoy electricity savings from clean renewable solar power.

          Patagonia’s investment comes through its $20 Million & Change fund [Update: the investment fund is now called Tin Shed Ventures.], launched in 2013 to help innovative, like-minded startup companies bring about solutions to the environmental crisis and other positive change through business. Or, in the words of Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, to help entrepreneurs and innovators succeed in “working with nature rather than using it up.” More information about Patagonia’s investments through the fund to date can be found at Tin Shed Ventures.Kinaʻole Capital Partners is a financial services company that offers customers the option of enjoying a solar energy system at no upfront cost. Customers simply agree to either purchase electricity generated by the solar system or lease the solar systems at a fixed rate that is typically less than the local utility’s rate. This electricity cost provides long-term savings to the customer and serves to reduce the amount of electricity that is purchased from the utility grid. More information can be found at Kinaʻole Capital Partners.Those interested in learning more about residential solar systems can visit Sungevity.com.

          As you leave the lowlands, headed upward and eastward, the land around you changes into something markedly different—with the Cascades as a divider, the thick forests of the coast and the fertile fields of the Willamette Valley give way to the open rangelands, rock outcrops and dry, snaking canyons of the Oregon high desert.Frigid in winter, sunblasted in summer and wind-scoured at any time of year, the high desert has always been a challenging environment for even the most resilient and well-adapted species. Those challenges have been further intensified by a changing climate and human-caused habitat degradation, but it remains a place where genuine wildness and great ecological diversity can be found—and it’s those qualities that the Oregon Natural Desert Association (ONDA) is working hard to protect.A grassroots nonprofit based in Bend, ONDA conducts a wide range of ecological restoration projects in the high desert. We’ve supported them through the Patagonia Environmental Grants Program, and we’ve also valued their feedback as field testers for our Workwear line.
            The Oregon Natural Desert Association (ONDA) connects volunteers with hands-on conservation and restoration opportunities in Oregon’s high desert. Here, Craig Terry—who has volunteered for Steens Mountain fence pulls for more than a decade—and ONDA’s stewardship coordinator Michael O’Casey discuss the day’s objectives. Photo: Sage Brown
          “Oregon’s high desert is home to pronghorn, sage grouse and all sorts of other wildlife that require large swaths of healthy habitat,” notes Ben Gordon, the director of ONDA’s stewardship programs. “Its diversity of life is still intact in many places, but through the years there’s also been a lot of activity that has had damaging effects on the landscape.”Each year, ONDA’s staff lead over 500 volunteers on multiday projects on both public and private lands throughout the desert’s 26 million acres. The work includes replanting along streams impacted by grazing, removing obsolete barbed wire fencing that impedes wildlife, and monitoring wildlife habitat and wildland conditions to assist government agencies in their management and conservation mandates. ONDA also envisioned, and continues to promote, the Oregon Desert Trail, a 750-mile route through some of the state’s most remote terrain.“The fence removal work,” Gordon says, “is part of a larger uplands improvement strategy to restore habitat quality and monitor the status of public lands. We pull and remove barbed wire fencing that’s no longer needed and impedes wildlife travel. We also retrofit fences, which involves converting the barbed top and bottom strands so that pronghorn can get under, and mule deer and elk can get over, without becoming ensnared.”
            ONDA volunteers have hauled out 63 miles of fencing, weighing 125 tons, from Steens Mountain. Here, a crew celebrates the final pull that left 97,000 acres of wilderness fence free. From left to right: Aaron Hellickson, Andrew Soulek, Craig Terry, Ellysa Lindenmaier, Amber Lamet, Michael O’Casey, Corinne Handelman and Clifford Rone. Photo: Sage Brown
          “Down in the valleys,” Gordon continues, “our riparian restoration program aims to make desert streams and river systems as resilient to a changing climate as possible, often through re-establishing native plant communities along the banks. There are riparian areas that were heavily overgrazed for many decades, but now there are willing landowners and agency partners who see the benefit of keeping cows off the stream and river corridors. Once new management plans or appropriate fencing are in place, our volunteers can replant with confidence and help those streams by giving them more shade, keeping them cooler and preserving as much of the desert’s water as we can. On those projects, volunteers plant 500 to 1,000 native plants in a weekend. It’s super hard work, and people bust their backs to get every last plant in the ground.”From riverbed to ridgeline, many of ONDA’s projects take place in wild areas with no road access—which means hiking miles into the backcountry with heavy-duty hand tools like Pulaskis, McLeods and post removers. “Each person hauls an average of 30 pounds of tools, plus their camping gear,” says Gordon. “It’s tough and slow-going work, but our volunteers are all incredibly dedicated people.”
            Camped out after a long day of work in the Steens Mountain Wilderness. Eighteen years ago, this became the first designated wilderness area in Oregon’s high desert. To preserve its wild character, ONDA has helped shape management plans, opposed industrial energy development and removed fences that endanger wildlife. Photo: Sage Brown 
          In addition to ONDA’s projects on public lands, the organization partners with landowners to help restore privately held land.“In the John Day River basin,” adds Gordon, “we’ve worked effectively with landowner partners. We’ve even done restoration projects on private land that are supported by government grants. Landowners recognize the great strength in ONDA’s volunteer capacity, and many of them would rather have volunteers working with their hands on the land instead of bringing in machines.“Those projects stem from a shared interest in wildlife habitat. As we work side by side and share stories around the fire afterwards, landowners who may have been circumspect about these kinds of projects in the past see that ONDA’s volunteers are genuine in wanting to improve the health of the high desert. They’re really out here to help the whole desert, and as a result they’re making the landowner’s personal properties better. It’s a win-win, so we’re looking to work with more landowners throughout the desert.“Ultimately, we want to do everything we can for native fish and wildlife habitat. And there are strong rural communities out here that we want to see thriving too. So, our emphasis is really on ensuring that the resource—the high desert itself—is as healthy as it can be.”

          For British Columbia’s timber barons, the forests of Vancouver Island were too rich to resist: giant spruce, fir and red cedar trees that fetched top dollar on the open market. On the island’s remote and rain-soaked Pacific coast, mechanized logging kicked into high gear in the 1950s and continued through the decades that followed.“Before 1995, no protection was afforded to stream ecosystems here,” says Jessica Hutchinson, a field ecologist and the executive director of the Central Westcoast Forest Society (CWFS).“They were able to log right up to the creeks, and we’re still seeing the impacts of that activity today. In some places it’s dark, tightly replanted monoculture forest where diverse and well-spaced old growth once stood, and in others it’s debris from logging operations that chokes a river out and causes excess sediment to build up. We also see collapsed bridges that impound streams, and even streams that were excavated for gravel for road construction. In those cases, the gravel was important spawning habitat for wild Pacific salmon.”
            Well-executed restoration work can help native species repopulate their former territories. Here, a chum salmon makes use of a newly constructed spawning platform in the tannin-rich waters of Sandhill Creek. Photo: Jeremy Koreski
          A nonprofit Patagonia environmental grantee, CWFS works to restore local forests and watersheds that have been damaged or degraded by human activity. Led by environmental scientists, the group’s research initiatives are complemented by many gut-busting days on the ground.“It’s a mission to get to most of our sites,” Hutchinson says, “and we pack in hundreds of pounds of gear by hand: chainsaws, winches, peaveys, you name it. We’re trying to help these watersheds recover, and that often means moving logs by hand and using hand-powered winches instead of excavators or other machines that would make the job easier but harm the understory and compact the soil.”

          Whether it’s deactivating roads, replanting native vegetation, clearing out clogged salmon streams or thinning out second-growth trees to let more life-giving light through to the forest floor, their projects help accelerate the natural process of recovery.

          “Restoration isn’t about getting a stream or forest to its prealtered condition,” she continues. “We’re never going to get it back exactly how it was. But what we can do is help that system heal. It’s superchallenging work, but we see a real resurgence in biodiversity within just a few years. And yes, it’s physically exhausting, but at the end of the day being part of a positive outcome is an amazing return on the investment. It feels good to undo some of the damage that’s been done.”WORKWEARWorkwear is not a new thing for us, but we’re excited to be reimagining the work-specific side of Patagonia. To stand up to the toughest tasks, we’ve developed a utilitarian line of jackets, shirts and pants built with super-durable, long-wearing fabrics like Iron Forge Hemp™ canvas—an innovative, heavy-duty blend of industrial hemp, recycled polyester and organic cotton. It’s 25% more abrasion resistant than conventional cotton duck canvas and needs no break-in. and our hemp-blend workwear clothing is also Fair Trade Certified™ for sewing.

VENTURA, Calif. — The offices of Patagonia occupy a low-slung complex of stucco buildings in this sleepy beachside town in Southern California. There are solar panels and picnic tables in the parking lot, day care with a jungle gym by the main lobby and easy access to the beach, where employees surf during lunch break. It is a corporate Eden of sorts, where idealistic Californians run a privately held company that sells about $1 billion of puffy down jackets and organic cotton jeans each year.But on an unseasonably hot and windy Monday morning in early December, Patagonia headquarters were transformed into something that quickly resembled a war room. There were emergency conference calls with Washington lawyers. Court filings were prepared. Web designers remade the company’s home page.It wasn’t a business crisis that had mobilized the company, however. It was politics.Hours earlier, President Trump had announced plans to sharply reduce the size of two national monuments in Utah. Bears Ears, an expanse of red-rock canyons rich with archaeologically significant sites, would be slashed in size by 85 percent, more than one million acres. Another monument, Grand Staircase-Escalante, would be reduced by half.Mr. Trump said the decision was about reducing federal overreach. “Some people think that the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington,” he said. “And guess what. They’re wrong.”Yet to the tribal groups and conservationists who had been monitoring the situation, including Patagonia, the decision realized some of their worst fears: that the Trump administration would be waging an assault on public lands, and potentially opening up protected areas to drilling and mining.Patagonia was as ready for this moment as any company could be. For more than 45 years, the company has mixed business and politics to a degree unusual in corporate America. While companies are expected to weigh in on everything from gun control to transgender rights these days — and many do so uncomfortably — Patagonia has been unapologetically political since the 1970s.It bills itself “the Activist Company” and publicly advocates for environmental protection, fair trade and stricter labor standards. It supports thousands of grass-roots environmental activists, and has been involved with Bears Ears since 2012. But until December, Patagonia had never tangled with a president.That Monday morning, about 50 Patagonia employees gathered in a conference room to watch Mr. Trump’s speech. The mood was somber. Then, within an hour of the president’s remarks, Patagonia updated the home page of its website. Instead of promotional images advertising colorful products, there was a stark message against a black background: “The President Stole Your Land.”At the same time, Patagonia’s legal team set into motion a plan that had been in the works for months: It would sue the president.ImageCredit...Laure Joliet for The New York TimesWorking with a handful of local groups and the law firm Hogan Lovells, Patagonia filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Washington. The lawsuit named as defendants Mr. Trump, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, the secretary of agriculture, the director of the Bureau of Land Management and the chief of the Forest Service. And the argument was simple: The Antiquities Act of 1906 gave presidents the power to create national monuments. But it did not grant the power to reduce them.“For as much authority as it gave to the president to create these monuments, Congress gave the president no authority to revoke or modify those monuments,” the lawsuit reads. “Congress is the sole authority that can undertake such changes.”Patagonia’s activism has made the company plenty of enemies over the years. Developers, the fossil fuel industry and lawmakers have all gone after the company, and this time was no exception. As Patagonia ramped up its campaign, the Trump administration hit back. Mr. Zinke and Republicans in Congress accused Patagonia of playing politics to sell more clothes, and the hashtag #BoycottPatagonia began circulating on Twitter.The barbs only stiffened Patagonia’s resolve. The company’s founder went on CNN and called the Trump administration “evil.” And Rose Marcario, Patagonia’s chief executive officer, made the protection of Bears Ears one of her top priorities.“We’ve always given to grass-roots organizations. it’s part of our D.N.A.,” she said in a recent interview at company headquarters, an American flag flying outside her window. “But the fight got a lot more urgent after the election. This was totally unheard-of.”It would have been enough for one day if Patagonia had just been caught up in a public spat with the president. But hours after Mr. Trump’s announcement, a more urgent crisis emerged: A brush fire was reported in Santa Paula, Calif., a small community not far from Patagonia’s headquarters.The hot, dry Santa Ana winds blowing that day whipped the fire into an inferno, and much of Ventura was soon evacuated. At the very moment Patagonia was preparing to sue the president, its campus was shut down indefinitely and employees fled their homes.“We did a lot of scenario planning for the lawsuit,” said Corley Kenna, Patagonia’s head of communications. “We didn’t put on the list that life-threatening fires would be happening at the same time.”Protecting a RiverPatagonia was founded by Yvon Chouinard, an enigmatic mountain climber with an interest in Zen Buddhism and a passion for the environment. In 1957, he taught himself to blacksmith, and began making and selling climbing gear that was less damaging to the rocks he and his buddies were scaling in Yosemite National Park.Within a few years, he had set up shop in Ventura and was doing a brisk business selling clothing for outdoor enthusiasts. He eventually called the company Patagonia, a homage to the vast mountainous region at the southern tip of South America, where he had recently traveled.Patagonia developed a cult following and expanded its offerings. But for the most part, the company was a means to an end, a source of funds that enabled Mr. Chouinard and his friends to surf, climb and travel their way around the world.That changed in 1972, when Mr. Chouinard attended a City Council meeting to hear about development plans along the Ventura River. Under a proposal being considered, the flow of the river would have been changed, and a prized surf break could have been ruined.At the meeting, it looked as if the development would proceed. Then a young environmental activist, Mark Capelli, took the floor. He presented a slide show and argued that the proposed changes would harm the birds, water snakes and muskrats in the estuary. The development was halted, the river was protected, and the surf break was preserved.Mr. Chouinard befriended Mr. Capelli and began to support his work, giving free office space to his nascent organization, Friends of the Ventura River, and helping to fend off several more attempts to develop the river.That set the template. Patagonia would offer small grants to local activists, give in-kind support through marketing know-how and business savvy, and amplify their message with customers. Mr. Chouniard also resolved to give one percent of Patagonia’s sales to support environmental activism.Patagonia has given out thousands of grants. In Alaska, the company has supported efforts to prevent waste from mining operations from polluting Bristol Bay, a productive salmon fishery. In Yellowstone National Park, Patagonia has worked to protect grizzly bears. In Poland, the company has advocated for the protection of forests. And Patagonia has waded into national politics before, having opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The company has produced feature-length documentary films, including “DamNation,” an argument against damming rivers. Every other year, it hosts a conference where activists share tips and best practices for protests, fund-raising and litigation. And in 2011, Patagonia famously placed an ad in The New York Times that read, “Don’t Buy This Jacket,” an effort to discourage excessive consumption.“Patagonia has established a unique role in the political and policy ecosystem, and are willing to be very public about their advocacy,” said Neil Kornze, who was a director of the Bureau of Land Management under President Barack Obama and now runs an environmental consulting firm. “They are a group of avid environmentalists who just happen to sell coats.”Business is booming under Ms. Marcario. A former private equity executive who walked away from finance to study Buddhist meditation in India for two years, Ms. Marcario joined Patagonia in 2008 as chief financial officer, drawn to the company’s environmental activism.“That’s why I’m not on Wall Street right now making a ton of money,” she said. “I’m kind of worried about the planet.”She was named chief executive in 2014, and has overseen Patagonia’s continued expansion. Revenues and profits have quadrupled over the past 10 years, according to the company.Under Ms. Marcario’s guidance, Patagonia has also struck out in new directions. It started a venture capital arm, Tin Shed Ventures, named after the metal hut — still standing — where Mr. Chouinard once forged and hammered metal, and has invested some $75 million in eco-friendly start-ups.It has opened a food business, Patagonia Provisions, selling dried buffalo, lentil soup and beer. It recently activated a social network of sorts, Patagonia Action Works, designed to connect engaged consumers with local environmental campaigns.And the company maintains a team of 18 people focused on supporting activism and distributing grants. Since 1985, Patagonia has given away some $90 million to environmental causes.“Science without activism is dead science,” Mr. Chouinard said in a recent interview. “We want to fund the little activist organizations that are out there on the front lines, the grandmothers in front of the bulldozers.”Writing on the WallIn 2012, one of the little activist organizations that Patagonia supported for the first time was Friends of Cedar Mesa, a small nonprofit organization advocating for the protection of a wide swath of sensitive desert in southern Utah, including the area that would become Bears Ears.At the time, Republicans in Utah, notably Representative Rob Bishop, were intensifying efforts to reduce federal protections of some lands in the state. Doing so could open the door for more oil and gas drilling and uranium mining, bringing in additional state tax revenue.Patagonia ramped up its support for Friends of Cedar Mesa, offering grants and producing a short film about Josh Ewing, the organization’s director, who goes rock climbing in the area. It was the kind of assistance Patagonia had offered to thousands of local groups over the years, and at the time, there was no sense that Bears Ears would soon become a point of contention in a national debate over public lands.“Patagonia has been interested in this area for a long time,” Mr. Ewing said. “More than any company I’ve ever seen, they put their money where their mouth is.”As Patagonia learned more about Bears Ears, which was a favorite of rock climbers, it came to appreciate the area’s significance. Sacred land to tribal groups and home to Hopi and Navajo ruins and petroglyphs carved into rock walls, it was a largely unspoiled terrain that could be threatened by expanded drilling and mining.“As we got more involved, we recognized the cultural and spiritual importance of the place,” said Lisa Pike Sheehy, Patagonia’s vice president of environmental activism. “This was a place that should have been protected 50 years ago.”In total, Patagonia has spent some $2 million on efforts to protect Bears Ears, including making grants to nonprofit groups, producing films and other marketing materials, and buying television ads. And at least for a brief moment, they worked.In December 2016, with less than a month left in his administration, Mr. Obama designated two new national monuments, including Bears Ears. It was a last-ditch effort by Mr. Obama to secure as much of his environmental legacy as possible. But with Mr. Trump’s inauguration looming, supporters of the monuments knew the victory might be fleeting.“We never got the chance to celebrate the monument being created,” Mr. Ewing said. “The writing was on the wall. There wasn’t ever a moment when we thought the monument was safe.”Inside Patagonia, Ms. Marcario and her staff knew their resolve would soon be tested. On the morning after Mr. Trump’s election, Ms. Marcario sent out an all-staff email. “Defending our air, soil and water has never been more important,” she wrote. “In the last few years, our voice and reach has grown louder and stronger … we won’t stop.”The fears were quickly realized. Shortly after Mr. Trump took office, he ordered a review of some national monuments, vowing to “end another egregious use of government power.”During a monthslong public comment period, the Interior Department received more than two million submissions, the majority of them supporting the continued protection of public lands. Patagonia said its customers had submitted more than 150,000 comments.During the first months of the new administration, Ms. Marcario and another Patagonia employee, Hans Cole, made numerous attempts to meet with Mr. Zinke as part of outdoor industry delegations, according to internal Interior Department emails reviewed by The Times. No meeting with Mr. Zinke ever took place, but Mr. Cole joined two meetings with Interior Department staff.Around this time, Patagonia also began planning for its eventual lawsuit. It enlisted Hogan Lovells, which tracked developments on the issue and organized a weekly conference call for the eventual plaintiffs.Meanwhile, Patagonia ramped up its publicity efforts around Bears Ears and public lands. The company worked with Google to start a website featuring videos, virtual reality and information about Bears Ears. It aired its first-ever television ad, featuring Mr. Chouinard sitting by a river, reflecting on the virtues of wild places.And Patagonia succeeded in its monthslong, retaliatory campaign to move a lucrative trade show out of Utah. For years, the Outdoor Retailer trade show had taken place in Salt Lake City, bringing business and tourism revenue to the state. But when politicians didn’t budge after Patagonia demanded that they voice their support for public lands, the Outdoor Retailer show was moved to Denver.The retailers added an economic argument to the campaign to protect Bears Ears: Outdoor recreation contributes more than $12 billion annually to the Utah economy, spending that could be jeopardized if public lands are developed.In the end, none of this made much of a difference. In August, Mr. Zinke proposed reductions to four monuments, including Bears Ears. Then Mr. Trump made his proclamation on Monday, Dec. 4, and all hell broke loose.‘Ash Falling Like Rain’That evening, Ms. Marcario was driving north along the California coast, returning home from a business trip. As she approached Patagonia’s headquarters, she could see flames encircling Ventura.“I saw the whole ridge line on fire,” she said. “I realized we wouldn’t be able to go back to the office.”Patagonia enacted its emergency plan overnight. Employees were instructed to stay away from campus, and the company offered to pay for accommodations for anyone who had to evacuate.A skeleton crew stayed behind at Patagonia, putting out spot fires as they flared up on campus. The fire spread, surrounding Ventura and consuming hospitals and apartment buildings on the outskirts of town.“There was ash falling like rain,” Ms. Marcario said. “It was something I have never seen before.”As the fire spread north, Patagonia and the Trump administration sparred publicly. Mr. Chouniard, typically a recluse, took to the airwaves to bash Mr. Trump. “This government is evil, and I’m not going to sit back and let evil win,” he said on CNN.Mr. Zinke hit back. “You mean Patagonia made in China?” he said on a press call, accusing the company of playing politics in a gambit to sell more clothes. “I think it’s shameful and appalling that they would blatantly lie in order to gain money in their coffers.”Then on Fox Business Network, Mr. Zinke took issue with Patagonia’s activism. “They should focus on how to bring manufacturing back to this country, rather than lying to the public about losing federal land,” he said.The House Committee on Natural Resources, chaired by Mr. Bishop, joined the fracas. “Patagonia is lying to you,” the committee wrote on Twitter. “A corporate giant hijacking our public lands debate to sell more products to wealthy elitist urban dwellers from New York to San Francisco.”Soon, the hashtag #BoycottPatagonia began circulating among Trump supporters on Twitter, and Stephen Colbert worked Patagonia into his “Late Show” routine.As Patagonia and Trump supporters traded barbs, the blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, became the largest wildfire in modern California history. Burning for more than a month, it destroyed more than 1,000 structures and forced the evacuation of some 100,000 people. Downtown Ventura and the Patagonia campus were spared, but five employees lost their homes.With the fire still burning out of control on Dec. 6, Ms. Marcario was working from her home in Montecito, 30 minutes north of headquarters. Friends and employees who had fled were staying with her, though Ms. Marcario would later be forced to evacuate, too.“Then in the middle of what felt like the apocalypse, across my inbox comes an email,” she said. “Patagonia versus Donald Trump, et al.”Ms. Marcario placed a call to her executive team and informed it that she had approved the lawsuit. Patagonia was suing the president.‘The President Stole Your Land’Since that week in December, the feud between Patagonia and the Trump administration has continued to simmer.Mr. Bishop invited Mr. Chouinard to testify before the Committee on Natural Resources. Mr. Chouinard declined the offer, calling any hearing a “macabre celebration of the largest reduction in public lands in American history,” and the committee part of a “failed Orwellian government.”Mr. Bishop replied to Mr. Chouinard with a tart letter of his own. “Although it is your right, living in a bubble isn’t healthy, nor is it conducive to a robust discussion on important matters of public policy,” he said. In an email, the committee’s press secretary said Mr. Chouinard was still welcome to testify.Then in March, The Times published an article that showed oil and gas interests were central to the Trump administration’s decision to shrink Bears Ears. After that, Patagonia updated its website yet again. The new copy: “The President Stole Your Land and You Were Lied To.”“The decision was nothing more than a political favor,” Ms. Sheehy, the company’s vice president of environmental activism, wrote in a blog post. “The redrawing of boundaries was deliberate, and directly influenced by an industry that spends millions of dollars lobbying the government to get what it wants.”The Trump administration has not formally responded to the lawsuit filed by Patagonia and the other plaintiffs. Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said in an email that claims that the redrawing of boundaries was motivated by oil and gas interests were “patently and demonstrably false.”Ms. Marcario draws a link between the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels and the Thomas Fire, which some climate scientists believe was made worse by climate change.“These are climate disasters, and they’re going to get worse and worse,” Ms. Marcario said. “We have an administration that isn’t paying any attention to that.”And the disasters weren’t over yet. In January, torrential rains hit the area. Hillsides eroded by the Thomas Fire came loose, and devastating mudslides roared through Montecito, killing more than 20 people and damaging the homes of several Patagonia employees.Patagonia’s lawsuit against Mr. Trump is currently tied up in the courts. It has been consolidated with two other cases filed by separate groups, and the government has asked a judge in Washington to transfer the case to Utah. There is no deadline for that decision, and until then, all proceedings in the case are stayed. Hogan Lovells, which has 25 lawyers working the case on a pro bono basis, has billed $1.7 million in hours to date.In the meantime, the area originally protected by Bears Ears National Monument is available for commercial use, including drilling and mining, though there hasn’t yet been any new development.At Patagonia, Ms. Sheehy said that while the company would see its suit against the president through to the end, it had an expansive time horizon when it came to environmental protection.“These are all long fights,” she said. “We’re in this for 50 years, 100 years.”"ÿÿPatagonia v.

          In March, we celebrated the incredible accomplishment of Kris and Doug Tompkins: a one million acre pledged donation of parkland to the Government of Chile, the largest land donation in history from a private entity to a country. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, with great generosity, committed an additional nine million acres of federally owned land to create five new national parks—including Pumalín Park and Patagonia Park—and expand three others.Among those in attendance at the small protocol signing ceremony at Pumalín Park were Yvon and Malinda Chouinard, Rick and Jennifer Ridgeway, and Jimmy Chin. The crew had intended to visit Patagonia Park to climb the famed Cerro Kristine—named for Kris by her late husband and partner in conservation Doug—but found themselves rerouted at the last minute for the signing ceremony.Patagonia Park has been intertwined with Patagonia, Inc. for decades, from Yvon and Doug’s first trip to Patagonia in the 1960s to employees who volunteered to remove fences on old sheep ranches to filmmakers, runners and explorers who shared inspiring stories of the good work happening in Chile.At this pivotal moment, let’s take a look back—to both the near and distant past—and reflect on the projects, people and campaigns that supported the largest park creation effort in our lifetime.

          “There were 150 of us—team members, high government officials, our delegation from Ventura and, standing at attention, the local fire department—all grouped in a semicircle at the Pumalín Park headquarters. When Kris and President Bachelet appeared walking hand in hand down the road to the signing there wasn’t a dry eye in the group, including me, and I never cry!”—Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, Inc., March 2017

          “This represents an enormous milestone for Kris, who, alongside her late husband Doug Tompkins, has worked for more than two decades to protect some of the most ecologically diverse and stunningly beautiful landscapes in the world from development so future generations can continue to enjoy the pristine nature of the Patagonia region of Chile and Argentina. The Tompkins’s tenacity and passion is a major inspiration for us all as our company continues to fight for the protection of Bears Ears and other public lands here in the United States, as well as conservation efforts in every corner of the world.”—Rose Marcario, CEO of Patagonia, Inc., March 2017

          “When first we started thinking about Valle Chacabuco becoming a national park, it was overrun and overgrazed from years of sheep ranching. Since then, volunteers from around the world have removed over 400 miles of fencing so native guanaco can have the freedom to roam. Condors and puma have rebounded, the endangered huemul deer is making a comeback and even more unimaginable success stories can be attributed to Kris and Doug and the creation of these parks.”—Malinda Chouinard, co-author of Family Business: Innovative On-Site Child Care Since 1983, March 2017

          “I was so proud of Kris, as I’ve known her since she was a teenage surfer girl living next door at Mondos Beach. She was our CEO at Patagonia during the very early high-growth tumultuous years. Doug I’ve known since he was a school dropout at 15, learning to climb in the Shawangunks with our vulgarian friends. To have these two juvenile delinquent/entrepreneur friends go on to create nearly 11 million acres of new national parks in Chile is a historical event without precedent. In comparison, Yellowstone National Park is only 2.3 million acres.”—Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, Inc., March 2017

          “Kris and her husband Doug have built this park using private donations and philanthropy. It reminded me of a sign that Doug used to have above his desk when he owned the woman’s apparel company Esprit. It said, ‘Commit and then figure it out.’”—Rick Ridgeway, Vice President of Public Engagement for Patagonia, Inc., June 2015

          “After multiple ferry rides, two days driving on dirt roads, we have arrived at Estancia Valle Chacabuco, in remote Patagonia. Kris Tompkins, as part of the Patagonia Land Trust, purchased the former sheep and cattle ranch in 2004. Overgrazing had taken its toll on the land so all the farm animals have been relocated. The goal is to restore healthy soils and open wildlife corridors by removing the 450 miles of fence line that winds through the 170,000 acres of mountains and valleys. The Patagonia clothing company has a program that encourages its employees to volunteer three weeks of their time down here, pulling up fences, all expenses paid. Makohe, Keith, Yvon and I showed up just in time to put in our time as well.”—Jeff Johnson, excerpted from the book 180° South, May 2011

          “Our mission for the first half of our stay was to remove exotic plant species from one section of the park. Thistle, lamb’s ear, and Cicuta were our main targets. Their seeds tend to travel along the road, carried by livestock or vehicles. The purple thistle flowers and yellow lamb’s ear blooms were easy to spot, but it was the never-ending groves of tall, fibrous Cicuta that nearly broke us. You could spend an hour freeing a cluster of trees, only to round the corner to find another grove 20-feet wide.”—Colin Pile and Alison Kelman, Patagonia employees, May 2014

          “That is where we spent the majority of the next three weeks, with views of Andean glaciers and ice fields. I expected we would spend some time pulling fence, but did not expect to be fully entrusted with long tracts for days at a time. We spent hours pulling and coiling wires, pulling pickets and posts, moving and piling everything. We got dirt under our fingernails, in our ears, in our hair, and down our backs. We got sunburned, bug bitten, and covered in burrs. We thrived on Nescafé, mutton and cheese sandwiches. We drank mate, vino, pisco and cervezas. Nights were filled with laughter and aching groans.”—Andy Mitchell, Patagonia employee, March 2007Luke Nelson during the filming of Mile for Mile—trail running and conservation in Patagonia.

When I open my eyes it’s still there, it feels like a dream, but it’s not—Patagonia spreads out all around me. I’ve long dreamt of seeing this place and now it’s blowing my mind. After imagining over and over what it would be like, how it would smell, how it would feel, it is far more than I had imagined it would be. The previous 39 hours have been a blur of driving, airports, flying, airports, loading gear, and more driving.

                                President Donald Trump’s Dec. 4 proclamation robs the American people of their public lands heritage. The President and a handful of politicians would like you to believe that they are doing what is best by rescinding 85% of Bears Ears National Monument and nearly half of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Nothing could be further from the truth. This action is unprecedented and widely unpopular. It is also illegal, and Patagonia will be challenging his decision in court.
                
                By eliminating so much of Bears Ears National Monument, the President is putting over a million acres of land at risk for permanent destruction, and we aren’t going to just stand by. Protecting public lands is a core tenet of our mission and vitally important to our industry, and we feel we need to do everything in our power to protect this special place.
                
                
                People often look at this as a states’ rights issue. We acknowledge that people who live closest to these lands often want what is best for them, like the Native American tribes near Bears Ears who are filing suit alongside us. We must also acknowledge that history shows when states control public-trust land, 70% is sold off — and then often used for oil drilling, mining and other industrial activities. This also means that hunters, fishers, outdoorsmen and families like yours can no longer enjoy them.
                  
                    
                
                  
                    
                
                While our complaint contains the specific legal arguments we’re making in challenging the President’s illegal actions, some very basic principles explain why we’re joining this lawsuit:
                To enforce the law. The Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution — Article IV, section 3, clause 2 — vests Congress with the power to manage federal lands. Through the Antiquities Act of 1906, Congress delegated a limited amount of power to the President — specifically, the authority to create national monuments protecting certain federal land. But it did not give the President the power to undo a prior president’s monument designations. It kept that power for itself.

                To carry out our purpose as a benefit corporation. Patagonia became a California benefit corporation in 2012, in order to legally enshrine our longstanding environmental and social values into the foundation of our business. Our articles of incorporation require that we confront urgent environmental threats by investing our resources as a growing business into environmental nonprofits.
                To stand with our grassroots partners. Since 1985, Patagonia has supported hundreds of grassroots organizations in all 50 states fighting to protect public lands at the community level. As a company, we have donated more than $80 million to these groups. Beginning in 2013, we joined tribal leaders and grassroots allies to advocate for the designation of Bears Ears National Monument, and have worked together to defend it from the President’s threats.
                To defend our business. Patagonia’s business relies directly on public lands, like Indian Creek in Bears Ears, which hosts world-class climbing. Powered by national monuments, national parks and other special public lands that draw millions of visitors a year, outdoor recreation is America’s fourth-largest industry — driving $887 billion in annual consumer spending and 7.6 million jobs, according to the Outdoor Industry Association.
                For more than a century, presidents of both political parties have upheld their solemn responsibility as stewards of America’s public lands by protecting our most special wild places. In every corner of the country and across the political spectrum, the American people resoundingly support this tradition. This is not about politics. it’s about protecting the places we love and keeping the great promise of this country for our children and grandchildren.

Patagonia is the world’s first brand to be certified to both the Responsible Wool Standard and the Traceable Down Standard.


Patagonia Traceable Down is traced from parent farm to apparel factory to help ensure that the birds that supply it are protected by the strongest animal welfare and consumer assurance standards. These include robust requirements in all areas of the birds’ lives, and especially protects against force-feeding and live-plucking.

We began working in 2007 to trace our down supply chain in the interest of sound animal welfare. Since fall 2014, all of the virgin down we use to insulate our products has met our own Patagonia Traceable Down Standard. In our Fall 2017 product season, we went a step further and announced that all our virgin down was also certified to the Global Traceable Down Standard (Global TDS), Advanced certification level by NSF International.

In 2018, Patagonia went even further and achieved certification at the brand level, becoming the first outdoor brand to be certified to the Advanced Global Traceable Down Standard. This added level of certification covers our internal product traceability systems as well as our distribution center. This allows certification of not only the down material in our products but the full final product itself.

How and why do we do this?

Our tracing process starts by auditing the parent farms, where birds are raised to produce eggs. This is where the highest risk for live-plucking occurs, as animals live there up to four years. Even though we don’t get our down from birds at parent farms, we feel obliged to look out for their welfare as they are an essential part of the down supply chain. This is what sets us apart from other brands also concerned about animal welfare.

The eggs produced at parent farms are transferred to other farms, where hatchlings are raised for their meat. We audit these farms to ensure sound animal welfare practices. Down is a byproduct of the food industry, and the down we buy comes exclusively from slaughterhouses. After it is collected from geese that have been killed for their meat, we follow it through washing, sorting and processing facilities to ensure proper traceability and segregation from untraceable down. We continue our audits all the way to the garment factory, where we make sure our certified traceable down is stored separately from that of other brands, and used only in our clothing. Audits then continue to our distribution center, where the down garments arrive, are checked in, stored and packaged to send out to our customers following the Traceable Down Standard brand requirements. It’s a lot of work. But this is how we help ensure the birds whose down we use in our products have been treated humanely.

The assurance of sound animal welfare and full chain of custody inherent in the Global Traceable Down Standard is the result of thousands of hours of work from our executives, designers, material planners, sourcing department, distribution center, suppliers and corporate social responsibility team. It was neither cheap nor easy, and we had to reexamine our strategy and business operations in the process. But building a long-lasting product that helps you stay warm in good conscience is a legacy of which we are extremely proud.






A Reverse Timeline of Our Efforts

2018

Since our last update we have worked diligently toward obtaining the next level of Traceable Down Standard certification for our own distribution center. This is taking the TDS certification and chain of custody due diligence a step past our garment factories to our warehouse where we ship products to our customers. We are happy to announce that we have reached that goal and are now the first outdoor brand to be certified to the Advanced Global Traceable Down Standard. The audit included a deep look into our own internal traceability systems, not just those of our suppliers. Now our TDS certification covers both the down material and the full final product itself. 

The assurance of sound animal welfare and full chain of custody inherent in the Advanced Global TDS is the result of thousands of hours of work from our executives, designers, material planners, sourcing department, distribution center, suppliers and corporate social responsibility team. It was neither cheap nor easy, and we had to reexamine our strategy and business operations in the process. But building a long-lasting product that helps you stay warm in good conscience is a legacy of which we are extremely proud.


2017

Our Fall 2017 product season marked an important milestone for us, as all of the virgin down we use is now certified to the Advanced level of the Global Traceable Down Standard by NSF, which developed and certifies to the standard. (Up until this time, our virgin down was verified to the Global TDS level.)

The Advanced certification level means our down suppliers conducted audits all the way back to the parent farms to ensure there was no live-plucking and that broader humane animal welfare standards were faithfully observed throughout the supply chain. (Most brands do not do this.) To offer certified assurance, we had to begin the audit process a calendar year earlier, in late spring 2016, because that is when the geese raising began.

Any brand or down supplier can get certified to the Global Traceable Down Standard, either to the “Conformant” level for collector down supply chains or the “Advanced” level for industrial supply chains. And since suppliers own their certification, they can sell certified Global TDS down to all interested customers. This will make it a lot easier for others to source down from birds that were raised humanely, which we’re hoping will lead to better animal-welfare practices industry-wide.

Being able to guarantee Advanced Global TDS certified down to our own customers is a huge achievement. We are extremely grateful to NSF International, our suppliers and everyone else who partnered with us to create a best-in-class down supply chain.

You can learn more about the Global TDS certification on the NSF International website.



2016

Since the launch by NSF International of the publicly available Global TDS in 2015, a lot has happened. In 2016, our entire supply chain—working backward from finished goods factories, to down processors, pre-processors, slaughterhouses, raising farms, hatcheries and parent farms—underwent and passed certification audits to the newly released standard. Certification audits took place at more than 300 entities, spanning six countries.

We learned a lot from the experience, including how to adhere to our goal of auditing the entire supply chain, while remaining flexible to the realities on the ground. In 2016, there were outbreaks of highly infectious avian influenza in several countries. We could not ignore the risks of contagion for the animals and the farmers. When visiting the farms, auditors had to follow strict protocols to mitigate spreading the disease that would result in the sacrificing of the animals. Thankfully, the farms that raise the birds that supply us with down were not affected, but this type of event jeopardized our meeting our timeline for certification. We also learned about the impact that unusually hot summers linked to climate change can have on the animals in the supply chain, and on the businesses that depend on them. It is now more important than ever to consider animal welfare.

Lastly, we learned that tracing back to and auditing the parent farm in such a large supply chain is challenging, it is far from impossible. We hope that other brands see this and also begin taking this important extra step to ensure parent geese are not live-plucked.

Everything we’ve learned we’ve shared with NSF International, which developed and certifies to  the Global TDS. They, in turn, have incorporated this information into improving the certification process.



2015

Wanting to provide other companies with a similar path forward, one that is both achievable and scalable, in 2014 we asked NSF International to adopt our standard as the basis for a global standard.

NSF International is an independent public health organization that works with manufacturers, regulators and consumers to develop standards and certifications that help to protect food, water, consumer products and the environment. We chose to partner with them because their methods and certifications are beyond reproach.

Recognizing that not everyone in the down industry would be willing or able to do everything we’ve done to assure animal welfare, NSF International used our standard as a basis for the new Global Traceable Down Standard. NSF International then partnered with down processors, manufacturers, retailers, animal welfare groups, trade associations and other non-governmental organizations to develop the multi-tiered standard that permitted stakeholders various degrees of implementation. All of these entities had a say in defining, refining and agreeing to final criteria.

After months of working with stakeholders, in January 2015 NSF launched its NSF Global Traceable Down Certification Standard designed for use by any company. The new certification covers down supply chains, starting at the parent farm and household collector farms, along with down products at the factory level.

This milestone marks the completion of one of our commitments to the industry and to our customers to turn our internal down verification program into a global independent certification and provide not only the highest level of animal welfare but also the highest level of transparency into down traceability and animal welfare.

Because we recently added new farms, slaughterhouses and processing facilities to our down supply chain, we are re-auditing it to achieve certification. In the meantime, our third-party verified Traceable Down products continue to offer the highest level of assurance for animal welfare in the apparel industry.

Once NSF International completes its certification process, you’ll be able to see the certified down supply chain on the NSF International website and on Patagonia’s Footprint Chronicles.

As further testimony to the strength of our efforts, Four Paws, the animal welfare organization that once campaigned against our company for buying down taken from birds that were being mistreated, recently released their evaluation of companies in the outdoor industry that used down. They rated Patagonia second in terms of best animal welfare practices. We are continuing our work and hope to be rated number one once our certification process is completed.

See Four Paws' Cruelty Free Down Challenge rating.



2014

From fall 2014 forward, all Patagonia down products contain only Traceable Down. This means we trace the source of our down from parent farm to apparel factory to help ensure that the birds are not force-fed or live-plucked. The Traceable Down Standard provides the highest assurance of animal welfare in the apparel industry. We began working in 2007 to achieve this, and are the only brand to have done so.

To improve down supply chains across the board, we are participating in the formation of an Outdoor Industry Association and Textile Exchange Down Task Force, part of the Materials Traceability Working Group. The goal is to foster collaboration among brands and suppliers to establish traceability standards and methodologies for down products and supply chains. Traceability will allow brands to verify claims about the down used in their products, including whether the geese that supply it have been live-plucked or force-fed.



2013

We receive results from the audit in January that show “no evidence of live-plucking or force-feeding practices” in our white goose down supply chain. Furthermore, the audit reveals “a robust traceability document chain, adequate labeling and segregation practices with room for improvement in a few areas.” We are now pursuing remediation of all report recommendations to further improve traceability and animal welfare in our down supply chains. We are also developing a screening process for our down suppliers based on our chain of custody audit and the assessment tools that came out of it. 

Patagonia has a history of effecting change in supply chains, and we are hopeful to do it with down. In this spirit, as of spring 2013, our entire collection of Ultralight Down clothing uses white down from geese that have been verified by an independent, third-party traceability expert to be non-live-plucked, non-force-fed. It is our hope to expand this offering each season as we build up a Traceable Down supply chain based on our Down Supply Chain Animal Welfare Standard.



2012

We commission an independent chain of custody audit of our new white goose down supply chain in Poland, hiring a traceability expert who begins a three-month-long investigation joined by the International Down and Feather League. Our goal is to score down traceability management systems and assess animal welfare. The two are intrinsically linked and equally important to assuring product-content claims.

From the moment we started this journey, we knew we needed an independent third-party to help us understand and verify sound animal welfare practices in our down supply chain. To that end, we partnered with traceability experts at Arche Advisors.

During the three-month period, auditors assess more than a dozen sites over seven field days, including a down garment factory in China, a down processor in the U.S., and various international down processors, slaughterhouses and farms - including a parent goose farm (where eggs are produced) and a hatchery. The auditors evaluate animal-welfare practices against the August 2012 version of the Patagonia down standard, as well as European Union and individual countries’ laws pertaining to animal welfare. To measure robustness of traceability of the supply chain, our expert looks at the hallmarks of good traceability: documentation trails, physical labeling and segregation of down, and management systems. She then verifies the system’s robustness through the tried-and-true supply chain auditing methodology of document review, observation and worker interviews.

We receive reports at each stage of the assessment in each country. They include assessment summaries, analysis of gaps in tracing systems, good practices and a final score for animal welfare and overall traceability management systems. We also receive a final summary report linking all site visits and one final quantitative score for traceability management systems and animal welfare/live-plucking/force-feeding.

To our knowledge, no other company has gone to such lengths to assure chain of custody.



2011

Wanting to get the facts firsthand, we send our director of social and environmental responsibility, our director of materials development and our strategic environmental materials developer to Hungary to investigate. They make two trips, one in February and one in August, accompanied by principals from our down supplier. The group visits representative links from the entire white and gray goose down supply chains—from parent farms (where the eggs come from) to breeding farms, slaughterhouses to down processors.

Our suppliers are forthcoming, but what we learn does not sit well with us. Four Paws is correct: We are unwittingly using down from force-fed geese raised for  foie gras and meat. We don’t see any evidence of live-plucked down in the parts of the supply chain we visit. And we verify that the slaughterhouses we inspect take steps to ensure they do not buy live-plucked birds and that they contract with the goose farms to specify that there is no live-plucking. This is bolstered by occasional audits of those farms

Existing chain of custody documentation provides good traceability of down from the farm level to the slaughterhouse thanks to Hungarian food industry laws. The chain of custody, however, is not as robust from slaughterhouse to down processors. We begin implementing a plan to improve document linkage and the labeling and separation of our down at all levels of the supply chain, including the garment factories, to ensure that we get no live-plucked material.

We also begin looking at other down supply chains where live-plucking and force-feeding of geese is illegal. Our materials team visits Poland to investigate potential new down sources, and we approve one source (that has limited capacity) for use in a range of styles.



2010

In December, Four Paws (a German animal welfare group) accuses us of using live-plucked down. a charge we refute. During the controversy, however, we learn from a Four Paws investigation that gray geese from Hungary, where we get our down, are routinely force-fed to produce foie gras. Force-feeding is now banned in many European countries but is still legal in France and Hungary.



2009

Aware of the fact that geese do suffer when their down is live-plucked, we require our supplier to certify that all virgin down for Patagonia products comes from slaughterhouses and does not contain any live-plucked down. We’re told that force-fed geese produce an oily, second-quality down that is not being supplied to us, so force-feeding is less of a concern.



2007

During an environmental impact assessment of the materials we use, we look at down. We find the global poultry industry (not limited to geese) has a record of inhumane treatment of birds, which are raised for their meat. This includes such things as caging, de-beaking, force-feeding and, on the environmental side, polluting air and water. We ask our down supplier a lot of questions to which they provide detailed answers. But wanting to confirm what they tell us, we send our strategic environmental materials developer to Hungary to visit a goose farm. He asks about living conditions for the geese, what kinds of chemicals the farm uses and how the geese are slaughtered for their meat. Our down supplier assures us our down does not come from geese that are force-fed, which we later find out is untrue. We learn that some of our down is taken from geese after they’ve been killed for their meat, and some is taken from live geese during their molting period. We consult an agricultural professor who says that removing down and feathers from live birds when they’re molting is not painful to the geese. Armed with this information, we attempt to explain the impacts of making a Patagonia Down Sweater on our Footprint Chronicles website.

          In 2015, we made the conscious decision to put a pause on our wool sourcing “until we can assure our customers of a verifiable process that ensures the humane treatment of animals.”We are happy to have accomplished our goal and to update you that as of fall 2018, all of the wool in our products has been certified to the Responsible Wool Standard (RWS), from farm to finished product. In addition, our key wool partners have also met the even more stringent requirements outlined in the Patagonia Wool Standard (PWS). The development of both the RWS and the PWS took careful consideration of best practices in animal welfare and land management and consultation with farms, animal welfare experts, brands and NGOs. You can view the Patagonia Wool Standard here.As part of our wider responsibly sourced wool strategy, we have worked not only with the farmers raising the sheep but with our entire manufacturing supply chain to obtain certification to the RWS. This has meant that everyone from the scourer/top maker (who washes and initially processes the raw or greasy wool), the spinner (who takes the clean wool and turns it into yarn), to the finished goods factory all underwent audits to ensure they had strict chain of custody practices in place. This ensures that the responsible wool that was shorn at the certified farms was not mixed or swapped with conventional wool from other sources. This effort has spanned multiple supply chains and countries. In 2015 there were no RWS certified wool farms nor processors, but since then Patagonia and other concerned brands, suppliers and ranchers have helped increase adoption within the industry.And that is not all. In order to ensure that we have “best in class” supply chain assurance from farm to finished product, we also had to obtain certification for our own brand. This involved changing the way we worked across many departments and even undergoing onsite RWS audits at our distribution center. Obtaining a final stage certification mark is an important milestone for Patagonia as a brand.Overcoming ChallengesAs with every major switch in sourcing we have learned a lot during the process. Here are a couple of examples:Supply chain traceability: For the majority of wool sourcing brands, even mapping their wool to the farm is practically impossible due to the number of consolidators, agents and traders that are a feature of the global wool market. Through our diligence we were fortunate to find wool suppliers who were willing to provide us visibility to their farms, and also guarantee the traceability of our wool through the supply chain.Finding likeminded wool partners: One of the biggest challenges was finding suppliers who were willing to start this journey with us and accept our requirements for wool, not only in quality but also in animal welfare and land management. Our Patagonia Wool Standard is the hardest to meet. this is due to the fact that two of our additional requirements involve processes that take place after the animals are sold by the farmer (when they are transported to the slaughterhouse, and the conditions in the actual slaughterhouse). This means the farmer has to obtain information on transportation and slaughter from their customers to whom the animals are sold. Keep in mind that the vast majority of the value of the animals is in their meat, not their wool, thus the meat customers have more leverage than we do as an apparel brand. Having said this, we were able to find great farmers who truly believe that this was possible and wanted to be part of the forward movement to become part of our preferred supplier pool.We know that our requirements have challenged farmers to change centuries-old traditional wool ranching practices. While we know that was difficult, we were inspired along the way by seeing how they overcame all the challenges. Our progressive farm partners first and foremost care for their animals and their land, that is their livelihood and legacy and they took our standards and crafted careful plans that helped them achieve the most robust animal welfare practices we have ever seen. It is also important to recognize that the men and women taking care of the sheep that give our wool are constantly faced with incredible business challenges from market fluctuations, legislative/policy developments, a changing climate, obtaining financing for their operations, and ensuring they train the next generation of farmers. We are honored they chose us to feature their wool in our products and applaud them for their commitment.

          Miles Johnson, our senior creative director, oversees the work of all our designers in both technical and sportswear categories, as well as the product development and textile, graphics and color teams. We caught up with Miles recently at the picnic tables outside our child care center to ask him about his life and work and the role of environmentalism in the creative process at Patagonia.   The road to Patagonia always seems to cross interesting terrain. Can you tell us a bit about your background and what drew you to the outdoors?I grew up in Pattingham, a village near Wolverhampton in the English midlands. At the edge of our village I had many escape routes to the countryside. My siblings and I were close growing up, as we lived a few miles away from school friends and spent most of our time outdoors and around the surrounding farms.My dad used to teach kids to ski and would take us each year, often for New Year’s, to Alpbach, a town in the Austrian Tyrol. My favorite thing to do was to join a lot of other people for a ski down the mountain with flaming torches, to the enjoyment of the townspeople on the other side of the valley, who would watch us come down from the top like a snake.I also love to travel with horses, carrying all our own equipment and provisions across mountain passes. My last trip was through the Tien-Shan range in Kyrgyzstan, close to China. For the next trip, I’m hoping to get up into the Carpathians in Transylvania, where you can study wolves with a couple who live up there.And what drew you to design?I originally wanted to be a painter like my grandfather. I went to the Bradford College of Art (where David Hockney studied). At one time Bradford had been a textile town that produced most of the U.K.’s woolen cloth. By the time I arrived, some of the old warehouses and mills had been turned into artist’s studios and event spaces. Towards the end of my time there I realized that my main interest was in fabric and clothing design, so I wound up working for the BBC as an assistant costume designer on a production of Pride and Prejudice. We hand printed traditional cloth with vegetable pigments and worked on patterns to make historical clothing for the actors. It was fascinating to learn how clothes had been constructed 200 years ago, or why the pockets on miner’s pants were placed where they were, or how something like the corset evolved. Years later I went back to school at St Martins College in London to study fashion and clothing design. It’s odd because I love clothes but have never cared about fashion. But fashion schools are the only place you can study clothing.

          And from there you wound up at Levi’s?Yes, I worked as a creative director on their premium and vintage lines, then branched out from there. I worked at Levi’s for 14 years before joining Patagonia over three years ago.Can you tell us how Patagonia’s environmentalism inspires you as a designer—and, in the opposite case, how our concern for our footprint might inhibit the creative process?It’s essential that the materials be right. It’s wonderful to be positively involved in a thorough way with the development and improvement of materials to make sure they’re made in the least harmful way.But it is also restrictive to be so thoroughly involved with your fabrics. As a result, we work with a much smaller range of materials than most companies do. So if we have a problem, a shortage, a quality problem with the weaving or knitting or the dye, we can’t just snatch or grab a substitute that might be lying around the factory and make an on-the-spot change. Nor can we change course as quickly as other companies. we have to be more thoughtful.Quality testing is a huge part of our work. Sometimes it takes a full year longer than we would like to introduce a new fabric because it has to be right in the first place. We want to instill confidence in the customer.Does this level of attention result in innovation and improved performance?New fabrics have to pass a hard look through the lens of sustainability, and that can lead to gains in performance. But we have some heritage styles that perform very well and require no innovation, yet still use virgin polyester or nylon. That remains a challenge, to improve the environmental performance of these styles without sacrificing their other qualities, including durability.We don’t always make the mills happy when we ask for more sustainable fabrics. But they know we’ll stick with a fabric longer than anyone else does, and that they’ll eventually have a good market from new customers because we influence other brands.

          We’ve spoken recently, around the tables at Patagonia, of going better than “causing no unnecessary harm” and actually doing positive good, helping to restore or regenerate ecosystems—to give back to nature more than we take from her. The focus of this effort is primarily through Patagonia Provisions and the food business, bringing degraded agricultural land back to health, reducing the need for water and even natural fertilizers, and creating the potential for ag land to draw down carbon from the atmosphere and get it back into the soil. Do you see any related potential in our clothing?We see good regenerative potential in hemp, which can be grown with very little water and is its own fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide. It’s very kind to the soil. Tencel® fiber, which we use in the women’s line for its soft drape, is another interestingly sourced fabric, made from waste, scrap and natural ground wood pulp.When you think about producing clothes, they’ll be on the planet longer than we are, longer than our grandchildren will be. Eventually, clothes made of natural fibers should be compostable. At the end of a shirt’s natural life, you stick your shirt in the ground and it makes your carrots more orange. The challenge is that every element of that shirt, from thread to button to interlining, has to be compostable, not just the base fabric.Materials aren’t the whole story. design and design details also shape the final product. How does Patagonia’s design philosophy affect the process of you and your team?Our design philosophy is restrictive, but, as with our environmental concerns, in a good way—the bias toward simplicity and utility helps keep us focused on intended use. It also makes Patagonia clothes identifiable. if you were to take the label off, you can still see it’s ours. Other brands may adopt a clean look to their design, but subtle details still differentiate us: the placement of the chest seam out of the way of shoulder straps, whether on an alpine parka or fishing shirt. the way we block color, or use different fabric for the chest pocket.The challenge is always to push ourselves outside our comfort zone, to try something new within the limits, or at the edge of the limits we set for ourselves. Our capsule collections, based on specific themes of all-recycled or all-reused materials, have helped with this.

          Can you speak a bit about how you work with your team?When our designers work on a new style, I often ask to see two options: One that raises the bar—surprises, invigorates, inspires. a second version has only to be straightforward, to perfectly fulfill its intended purpose. Next, we’ll ask the question, does it have to be one or the other? Are there elements of both that will create an original, exceptional product that’s best in class?Some of our best ideas now come from our archives, which holds many of the styles Patagonia has produced over the years. The collection offers us an amazing menu of ideas, perhaps not brilliantly executed the first time around, but still solid, something that can be made new and extraordinarily modern and forward-looking. That’s the virtue of concentrating for so long not on fashion, but on timeless design and function.What about the future?We constantly work on technical innovations to improve performance. In the future, we should be able to make versatile clothing with a wider range of comfort. Imagine a jacket that keeps you comfortable in hot weather and offers sun protection, yet keeps you warm and dry when the weather changes. Extremely versatile clothing will require fewer resources and offer more to the user.An abbreviated version of this story first appeared in the October 2017 Patagonia catalog.

The outdoor apparel brand just released a new wool standard to ensure the natural fiber comes from suppliers that don't mistreat their sheep

This week, Patagonia released what it's calling the Patagonia Wool Standard, a set of principles guiding the animal treatment, land-use practices, and sustainability of the wool in its products. It’s a policy that’s been over a year in the making.
First, some background. In August 2015, the animal rights organization PETA released a video apparently showing sheep being badly mistreated at a farm in Argentina that was part of a supply group called Ovis 21, which sold wool to Patagonia and other brands. Patagonia, which had initiated the process for creating a responsible wool standard in 2014, immediately announced that it would no longer do business with the Ovis 21 network.
“Patagonia will continue to make products from wool because of its unique performance attributes,” the company said in a statement last August. “We will continue to sell products made from the wool we’ve already purchased … But Patagonia will not buy wool again until we can assure our customers of a verifiable process that ensures the humane treatment of animals.” Soon after, the brand set out to reinvent their wool supply. They met with animal rights organizations and American wool ranchers and performed extensive audits of sheep farms. The resulting guidelines detail everything from how the animals should be fed, sheltered, restrained, sheared, transported, and more.
A few months ago, Patagonia brought Temple Grandin, a livestock welfare consultant and a professor of animal science at Colorado State University, out to their Ventura, California, headquarters for a day-long meeting with Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario and other staffers to discuss ways to improve the treatment of sheep and the auditing process of their wool suppliers.
“At the meeting, I showed them videos of what a decent sheering should look like. Sheering, like anything, can be done right or it can be done sloppily,” Grandin told Outside. “Some companies water these types of guidelines down, but Patagonia seemed very serious about drafting strict standards that would actually work. I’m not going to say their guidelines are perfect, but they’ve taken a big, giant step.”
Grandin says Patagonia’s new guidelines outline certain zero-tolerance policies, or acts that will get a ranch kicked off their approved supplier list. That includes actions such as letting sheep starve, certain slaughtering methods, or mulesing, which involves aggressively cutting skin from the animal’s backside to avoid infestation. “We talked about having certain things in their guidelines that you just won’t tolerate,” Grandin says. “And mainly, you’ve got to make sure that the third-party auditor is actually doing their job.”
This week, Patagonia also announced its partnership with two fully-vetted wool suppliers, one in Maupin, Oregon, and another in Park City, Utah, that will provide wool for their socks. (They are still seeking sources for the company’s merino wool baselayers and other products.) “We’ve talked to the people who do the work, worked through what is actually possible, and put forth the highest possible standards in a new supply chain that involves the best possible partners,” Patagonia said in a statement.

          Much has been written about the effects of plastic on the marine environment, from the Texas-sized Great Pacific garbage patch, to bottles expelled from cruise ships washed up on the beach, to “ghost” nets and weirs abandoned by factory-sized trawlers, and more. A new report on marine plastics was presented at the World Economic Forum earlier this year. It highlights the gravity of plastic pollution—“in 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the sea”—and notes that plastic packaging is the primary culprit. CNN proclaimed: “The world is flooded with plastic garbage.” The study finds that 95 percent of plastic packaging material is lost to the economy after a short single-use cycle, at a cost of $80-120 billion. The sizeable portion of this plastic that ends up in our environment takes an even greater toll, financially and on the health of the planet.Packaging represents the biggest part of the problem, but it’s not the only source of plastic pollution. Recently, attention has focused on banning or advocating for the discontinuation of tiny plastic particles in the form of microplastic beads from cosmetics, toothpaste and other consumer products often too small to be filtered by wastewater treatment plants. These work their way from our sinks and showers through treatment plants and into the oceans, where they make their way into the digestive tracts of sea turtles, sea birds and fish (and, subsequently, humans).Microplastic waste also includes synthetic microfibers (less than 5mm in length) detached from synthetic garments—such as polyester fleece, nylon shorts or a wide range of other types of clothing—during washing that get past or around the filter systems in treatment plants. These synthetic microfibers can end up in the ocean, on beaches, and in rivers and lakes. Some end up on land. Some microfiber waste that is successfully separated in the treatment plant from liquid effluent still resides in sludge used to fertilize fields. This issue really hits home for us because many of our garments are made with synthetic fibers.What we know and don’t knowWe know a single synthetic garment can shed thousands of synthetic microfibers in a single wash. We also know synthetic microfibers, as opposed to microplastic beads, have an irregular shape that can pose a threat to smaller organisms—and may enter the food chain and work their way up to humans.We also know we sell a lot of fleece. what we produce, combined with all the polyester and nylon products made and sold by other outdoor and apparel brands (and other industries), may constitute a significant problem.However, as public discussion about synthetic microfibers in the ocean has grown, much is yet unknown. For example, we don’t know the extent of the harm to organisms and we don’t understand how any negative impacts from synthetic microfibers might compare to the broader issue of ocean plastic pollution (or to other pressing environmental issues, such as climate change). And we are just now getting an early sense of how potentially key variables, such as fabric quality or washing technology, may affect the path of microfibers from our homes to our oceans.
            Fibers captured on a 20 micron filter. A micron (or micrometer) equals one millionth of a meter (a centimeter is one hundredth of a meter). The fibers were captured by filtering washing machine effluent after washing a Patagonia jacket. The scale in the photo indicates the length of 1,000 microns.

          Gaining a preliminary understandingLast year, out of growing concern about this issue and a desire to investigate it on behalf of our industry, Patagonia commissioned a research project under the direction of Dr. Patricia Holden, an eminent environmental microbiologist at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The study, entitled “Microfiber Pollution and the Apparel Industry,” has just been completed, and you can view the results here.The students that contributed to the project—including 2016 Master’s of Environmental Science and Management candidates Nicholas Bruce, Niko Hartline, Stephanie Karba, Bess Ruff and Shreya Sonar—did a great job under Dr. Holden’s supervision, and their study has helped us gain a better grasp on the issue. Although the influence of construction techniques was not tested, nor were different types of detergent used in the washing process, the study presented the following findings:We and other makers of polyester and nylon textiles likely contribute a significant portion of microfiber pollution to the ocean. however, the quantity is unknown, as is the extent to which these fibers may harm the ecosystems in which they are found.Brand and quality matters: in the study, a low-quality, generic brand fleece shed approximately 170 percent more over the course of its lifespan than Patagonia’s high-quality products.Our washing machines represent an integral step in the path to pollution. we’ve learned that jackets washed in top-load washers shed approximately seven times as many microfibers than in front-loaders.Wastewater treatment plants filter 65 to 92 percent of microfibers entering their system, but still release a significant volume of waste into the environment.Fabric construction appears likely to impact shedding.Further stepsWe recently convened a group of scientists, academics and public advocates—including some we’ve funded over the years through our grants program—at Patagonia’s headquarters in Ventura for an open discussion about the current status of scientific research. Basically, we discussed what we know and, more significantly, what we don’t know. It was a very enlightening discussion on both fronts.Further research is needed to understand the extent to which synthetic microfibers in the ocean harm the ecosystem. This information, in turn, will help us not only understand the problem itself, but also assess it in the context of the broader set of urgent environmental issues we face. This study nevertheless has given us an initial understanding about our contributions to the issue, and we hope others in our industry and beyond will read it closely as well.With this initial information in hand, Patagonia will be taking a few steps in some key areas over the coming months.Industry: We’ll work to bring our business colleagues and competitors together through the Outdoor Industry Association so we can build a collaborative approach to gain more knowledge and consider future action.Materials: We’ll explore ways to integrate criteria to assess shedding of synthetic microfibers into our methods for research, testing, development and application of new materials within our product line.Appliances: We’ll reach out to appliance manufacturers to initiate discussions about potential efforts to bring more effective filtering processes to industrial and home washing machines, as well as research how the mechanical design of washing machines, including agitation techniques, may affect the release of synthetic microfibers.Grant Giving & Strategic Investments: We’ll continue to support nonprofit organizations working hard to bring awareness to the issue of microplastics in the ocean. (Through our grant program over the past five years, we’ve made approximately $180,000 in grants to groups working to address ocean plastics issues, including the Algalita Marine Research Foundation, Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation, Surfrider Foundation, the 5 Gyres Instituteand others. We’ve also invested in a waterless textile processing company called Tersus Solutions through our $20 Million & Change fund. Tersus’ technology has been applied in commercial laundering, and we hope their innovations may help reduce the prevalence of microfibers in wastewater over time.)We live in a plastic-based economy and it’s clear there are a lot of areas where our use of plastic materials create waste that harms our environment. We’re learning more about the prevalence, impacts and source of synthetic microfibers in the ocean and elsewhere, and it’s clear this is an issue that demands our attention. At Patagonia we strongly believe that engaging directly with the challenges our industry may face—to broaden our knowledge and bring ideas together—will lead to better outcomes for the environment in the long run than seeking short-term fixes, and so we felt strongly about bringing a comprehensive update on this issue to our customers. We will keep you posted on our progress.What can you do as a customer?As always, don’t buy what you don’t need because everything we make—and everything you consume—has an adverse impact on the planet.Make sure to buy high-quality, durable synthetic clothing when you do have a need.Minimize how often you wash your fleece as much as possible.On the larger issue of ocean plastics, NationSwell has a great list of things you can do to reduce your reliance on single-use plastics. We recommend you check it out.Editor’s note: For the most recent news on this issue, please read our new post: “An Update on Microfiber Pollution.” Updated 6/22/17: Changed top imageUpdated 5/8/18: Corrected stats for front-load washers

        Much of what we sell is grown, and that’s why we’re investing in regenerative organic agriculture, a set of farming methods that conserves water, restores topsoil and removes carbon from the atmosphere.

          Ever since Patagonia had an office (and wasn’t just selling gear out of the back of Yvon’s car), we’ve devoted desk space, our free time and a percentage of our sales to protecting wild nature. From our travels, we knew our land, air and water was in real trouble from short-sighted profiteers.Over the years, it also became clear that in speaking up for the trees, rivers, salmon and grizzlies, we were not only fighting for the places (and critters) we love but also for everyone. No place is safe from the overheating atmosphere, and soon the lives we save may be our own. The climate crisis is a human issue.The science is clear in stating that the primary cause of the climate crisis is an excess of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, and, honestly, our business is deeply implicated. From petroleum-based polyester threads and fabrics woven on coal-powered machines to waterproofing treatments and shipping clothes in plastic mailbags, we’re enmeshed in carbon emissions. Many of us still drive to work in cars and travel by airplane. It’s a lot to change, but we’re working our tails off to do so. We’ve set an ambitious, but attainable goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2025 across our entire business, including our supply chain.
            OK, maybe it’s not totally green, but it is far less “brown.” This factory in Italy run by the Calamai family produces the recycled wool we use in our recycled wool and Woolyester clothes. Recycling fabric doesn’t eliminate all of the associated greenhouse gas pollution, but it does cut carbon emissions, depending on the fiber, by 44 to 80%. Photo: Jeff Johnson
          The supply chain is what textile and other manufacturers use to describe everything from the crops grown to make yarn to the sewing of fabric into garments and the shipping of finished clothes to warehouses, stores and, ultimately, your mailbox. Patagonia’s supply chain accounts for 97% of our carbon emissions.When we say we’ll be “carbon neutral” (“net zero” is another term you’ll hear), that means that we will eliminate, capture or otherwise mitigate all of the carbon emissions we create, including those from the factories that make our textiles and finished clothing, and the farms that grow our natural fibers. That last part is crucial. There’s a common misperception that much, or most, of our carbon pollution comes from transportation. In fact, 86% of our emissions (all but 11% of the 97%) come from the raw materials we use and their supply chains, which is why we’re so focused on recycling (and more on that in a sec). Our real aim is to become “carbon positive”—meaning we take more carbon out of the atmosphere than we put in, even as our company grows.It’s a great goal to have, but we haven’t made a lot of noise about it because, well, some of it’s going to be really hard to achieve, and we prefer to talk about stuff we’ve actually done.
            Welcome shade, plus juice for our laptops: Solar panels at our Ventura headquarters are one way we’ve been able to source 100% of our electricity needs in the US from renewable sources. Photo: Tim Davis
          So, let’s look closer at what we’re doing to get there.We will use only renewable electricity for our Patagonia retail stores, distribution centers, regional and global offices and headquarters by 2020. As of now, we are at 100% renewable electricity in the US and 76% globally.We will reduce energy use throughout our supply chain, work with suppliers to convert to renewable energy and invest in renewable energy projects to cover the remainder of our carbon footprint. Sometimes, this is as easy as asking a partner to convert. Other times, it’s super-complicated and involves local infrastructure, multiple players and politics.We will use only renewable or recycled materials in our products by 2025. Remember how we said most of our emissions come from virgin materials? This one is big. While using recycled fibers doesn’t eliminate carbon emissions, they do reduce them by 44 to 80% (depending on fiber type). If you factor in everything else that goes into making a garment, the impact reduction is less impressive (10-20% per item), but that’s where we see real potential. Meanwhile, converting to renewable and recycled materials reduces water use and keeps plastic from landfills and the oceans. As of fall 2019, 69% of our line includes recycled material.
            For the price of a high five, we help customers—like these Bulldogs at the University of Georgia—to keep their favorite fleece in play. And keeping clothes out of landfills helps more than you might think. Continuing to use a parka, say, for nine additional months slashes its carbon footprint by a third. Photo: Kern Ducote
          We will grow our Worn Wear® program and make it a robust business unit that supports various initiatives encouraging reuse, repair and recycling to extend the life of products and reduce their environmental footprint. Even nine months of use reduces the carbon footprint of a garment by 30%.We’re investing in regenerative organic agriculture as a source of raw materials for our apparel and food for Patagonia Provisions. Regenerative is a catch term for a group of farming practices—organic, compost, little or no till, crop rotation, cover crops and intercrops—that have been shown to have lots of benefits, but first and foremost, promote the creation of healthy topsoil. These techniques have also shown promise for drawing more carbon into the soil and storing it better than other farming methods. So we’re testing it out and working with others to develop a Regenerative Organic Certification to help alert people to products that have the potential to not only do less harm, but more good.We will invest in other carbon-capture projects, like reforestation, across the globe.As a company, there is much more that Patagonia is doing about the climate crisis, including supporting youth climate activists during Climate Week 2019.In 2018, we changed our mission statement: “We’re in business to save our home planet.” And we’re living this mission in our marketing and communications, and with our documentary films and investments in businesses through Tin Shed Ventures. For example, we’ve invested in Wild Idea Buffalo Company, a ranch in South Dakota whose buffalo are helping restore the Great Plains ecosystem and keep more carbon in the ground. Happily, Wild Idea now supplies the delicious buffalo jerky sold by Patagonia Provisions: a win-win-win.
            Our wetsuit factory. In Yulex® natural rubber, harvested from these Hevea brasiliensis trees in Guatemala, we found a plant-based replacement for neoprene in our wetsuits. A happy accident of weaning ourselves off petroleum and petrochemicals has been discovering ways of making our products that are not only less toxic, but, simply put, more beautiful. Photo: Tim Davis
          Since we gave a desk and a check to a grad student working to restore the Ventura River in 1973, we’ve donated more than $105 million to grassroots environmental organizations. Many of them are concentrating their efforts on climate and building resilience. (You can find a group near you to support or volunteer with on Patagonia Action Works, our social network for activists).The climate crisis is huge, complicated and often overwhelming, so it’s important to see progress—and we do. We’re seeing carbon reductions in our supply chain, and we’re seeing great wins from the activists we support.When Mark Capelli took that desk in our offices, the Ventura River was so depleted, a few told him his efforts would be futile. Today, it’s not perfect, but it runs yet, and more cleanly, to the Pacific.

          Our home planet has a deeply disturbing and pervasive problem with plastics. In April, a group of researchers studying the deepest part of the ocean—the Mariana Trench—discovered plastic bags and candy wrappers floating nearly seven miles below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.Globally, about 450 million metric tons of plastic are produced every year and 9.5 million tons of plastic are thrown into the ocean annually, most of it single-use. Both these numbers are on the rise. A report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation says by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than there are fish (by weight).Patagonia has always had a plastics problem, too. We’ve made significant progress on recycling the high-quality polyester and nylon we use in many of our best products—in 1993, Patagonia was the first outdoor clothing manufacturer to transform trash into fleece. We are constantly evaluating new materials and reevaluating existing ones. When the best available materials aren’t good enough to meet the need, we work closely with our suppliers to develop outstanding new fabrics.
            We’re investigating biodegradable synthetic fibers as a solution to microfiber shedding from washing garments. Our tests have shown us how complex biodegradation is depending on the environment where a garment meets the end of its life, but also on what type of finishing is applied to the fabric and also on what type of test method we’re using.

          Polyester has undeniable benefits, says Ryan Thompson, Patagonia’s manager of materials R&D for the technical knit, naturals and trim categories. “In historic alpine insulation systems, the material of choice was almost always wool,” says Thompson. “The transition to polyester happened because we could offer an economical alternative to wool with similar performance and comfort characteristics.” While wool takes days to dry out, polyester can keep you safe and dry if the weather shifts in the backcountry. Thompson notes, “It’s a great material to layer. We can manage polyester’s affinity to water, it’s durable even at light weights and it’s easier to maintain because it’s machine washable and dryable.”Today, our materials team uses recycled polyester made from used soda bottles and unusable manufacturing waste to create new polyester fibers for clothing. And our extensive field testing shows it performs just as well, if not better, as gear made from virgin polyester. Using recycled fabrics limits our dependence on petroleum as a source of raw materials and prolongs landfill life, while also reducing toxic emissions from incinerations. This fall, 69 percent of all Patagonia materials will be derived from recycled materials. Switching to recycled from virgin materials also means we’ve reduced our carbon footprint by 13,000 tons of CO2e. Our goal is to use only renewable or recycled materials in our products by 2025.To solve our plastic pollution problem at its root, we are partnering with scientists, researchers and other apparel companies. Our gear and care guides are meant to inform customers on how to keep gear in play longer. Our supply chain stories tell the reality of what goes into making clothes—our effort to educate customers to make informed shopping decisions. By talking openly about our trials and failures in minimizing our impact, we hope to inspire solutions and collaboration within the clothing industry.MicrofibersMicrofibers are tiny fibers five millimeters or smaller that fall from synthetic garments—such as polyester fleece or nylon shorts—during washing and can get past or around the filtration system in treatment plants and end up in the ocean, on beaches and in rivers and lakes, and sometimes settle in places where they don’t belong, like in the belly of a fish.Patagonia first found out about microfibers in 2011 when research from marine biologist Dr. Mark Anthony Browne at UCSB found high concentrations of microplastics, specifically fibers, on beaches all around the world. Fleece was initially flagged as the main culprit, but we have since learned that all fabrics contribute to the problem. Both synthetic and natural materials produce shedding during washing, and scientists are still looking into the impact of microfibers coming from different materials. Whereas natural fibers eventually biodegrade, synthetic ones do not, which adds to the growing plastic problem in our oceans.To date, we have funded five projects looking at solutions to pollution from microfibers. We charged our own materials development team to identify fiber types and construction techniques that minimize shedding. To aid that effort, we commissioned a study from North Carolina State University to help us understand which characteristics in fabrics lead to microfiber release—and to develop a rapid test methodology to assess the potential of fabrics to shed during laundering. Most recently, we partnered with REI, MEC and Arc’teryx to commission a study from the nonprofit Ocean Wise, the Vancouver Aquarium and Metro Vancouver on the effectiveness of that region’s wastewater treatment plants at filtering microfibers. We’ve been writing all about these efforts and what we learned on our blog.
            Your curbside recycling program will most likely not recycle this polybag we use to package Patagonia products, but most chain supermarkets can and so do all our stores. Polybags are made from plastic film and ours use 20% recycled content. Next spring, all our polybags will be made from 100% recycled content. Photo: Tim Davis
          Plastic packagingPatagonia uses polybags to individually wrap products from our factories, to provide protection during shipping and handling. Polybags are made from polyethylene film (plastic film #4 or LPDE film), a type of plastic not commonly recycled in curbside recycling systems throughout the United States.City recycling systems may not be able to recycle this plastic, but we’ve found suppliers who can. In spring of 2020, the polybags we use to package our products will be made of 100 percent recycled content which will be Global Recycle Standard (GRS) certified.We encourage you to also recycle the polybags that come with your products. Most chain grocery stores have bins at the entrance of their stores to collect used plastic grocery bags. The polybags used to package Patagonia’s garments can be recycled with grocery bags. You can find recyclers in your area on Earth 911.com.
            The Great Pacific Garbage Patch lies somewhere between Hawaii and California and is predicted to contain at least 87 thousand tons of plastic. 46 percent of this plastic is made up of discarded fishing nets. Bureo, a company based in Ventura, California, collects discarded fishing nets through a traceable supply chain in South America and recycles them into material for skateboards, sunglasses, and surf fins.

          Keeping plastic out of the oceanThrough our Tin Shed Ventures® fund, we invested in Bureo®, a company based in Ventura, California, which collects discarded fishing nets through a traceable supply chain in South America. Bureo recycles these nets into NetPlus™ material and turns them into skateboards, sunglasses and surf fins. We are now collaborating with Bureo to integrate their material into Patagonia hard-goods and textiles. So far, Bureo has diverted more than 6.8 million square feet (over 500,000of fishing nets from the coastlines of South America.Biodegradable plastic“Biodegradable” and “compostable” claims appear on many consumer products—from detergents and flowerpots to plastic bags and even textiles. But because of the different ways we dispose of solid waste (in the US we typically send waste to landfills, while in Europe it is common for waste to be incinerated), these products are rarely given the chance to decompose.Biodegradable means a material will break down through microbial action into basic elements found in nature. That is, they must be “eaten” by microbes, such as those found in soil, and the decomposition must occur relatively quickly. Many materials will degrade over time from sunlight, heat, moisture and mechanical stress, but this alone is not biodegradation.Natural products are perceived to be inherently biodegradable, but this is not necessarily true. For example, leather is made by “tanning” animal skin into a durable product but takes between 25 and 40 years to break down. Cotton fiber is biodegradable, but a cotton shirt has other components that may not be. Sewing thread is often polyester or cotton wrapped around a polyester core, and buttons are most commonly made of plastic or metal. Even the dye that gives color to the cotton may be an issue when the fibers degrade and leave microscopic amounts of dye in the soil. Plastic and synthetic materials can be made with additives to help them degrade faster. But if they don’t fully break down into basic elements, the resulting “microplastic” can pollute the environment.Since 2015, we’ve been investigating biodegradable synthetic fibers as a solution to microfiber shedding from washing garments. Patagonia commissioned a third-party study with Belgium-based OWS to evaluate the biodegradation behavior of our existing and future fiber materials in the marine environment. Through this research we’ve identified just how complex biodegradation in varied environments is depending on test method, textile finishing or environment (marine, landfill, wastewater treatment, industrial compost).
            Using recycled polyester not only keeps plastic out of landfills, but also reduces our carbon emissions by 40 percent compared to using virgin materials that are directly extracted from petroleum. And our extensive field testing shows recycled performs just as well, if not better, as gear made from virgin polyester. Photo: Lloyd Belcher
          The results did not conclusively show that the biodegradable synthetic technologies we tested biodegrade in the marine environment. The marine environment is so varied that an appropriate test method to correlate to the real world is challenging—we know we need to crack that nut if we want to make any definitive claims. Additionally, our testing showed that wool, widely regarded as a natural and biodegradable fiber, did not break down in the marine environment. Based on these tests, we are unconvinced that minor modifications to synthetic fibers could dramatically increase the biodegradation rate in the marine environment.At this point, biodegradation has not proven to be a solution to microfiber pollution. We want our products to have a long life and to be durable and reliable. We will continue to look for new technology for biodegradable materials and to work with academia and other makers to evaluate them. It’s a serious challenge, but an exciting one.The day will come when polyester and nylon clothes from Patagonia will be sourced entirely from some of the 6 billion tons of plastic already circulating the planet. Or these fabrics will come from natural sources, plants grown in a way that does not reduce the production of food. Completely recycled or bio-based polyester and nylon will likely still come at some environmental cost, but one far less dear than the one we all face for the convenience and advantages of plastic.

For CLW Response to Bloomberg's report on Pegatron, please visit the link.
Introduction
In 2013, China Labor Watch (CLW) began investigating the labor conditions of workers at Pegatron Corporation factories in China making products for Apple. In February 2015, CLW published a research report based on analysis of 96 pay stubs collected from workers of Pegatron Shanghai, discovering difference between the working hours which Apple publicly promotes and the reality on the production line.
This year, CLW collected 1,261 pay stubs from Pegatron Shanghai workers, 13 times as many as stubs as last year. The documents were gathered with the assistance of 18 Pegatron workers coming from 12 departments, who in turn collected pay stubs from workers of many other departments. Of the 1,261 pay stubs collected, 1,122 valid pay stubs were from the months of September and October 2015, which are in the busy season for iPhone production at Pegatron. Among those pay stubs, 1,035 were from October. in a factory of 70,000, the sample error is 1% at a 99% confidence interval. (Pay stub raw data.)
CLW used data from the pay stubs, especially for the months of September and October, to calculate wages and working hours for Pegatron workers. Results of this research demonstrate that workers making Apple products continue to work tremendous amounts of overtime in order to make up for their minimum wage compensation. A worker surnamed Zhou told CLW, “When it is busy, we have to work very long hours and take only one or two days off each month. Sometimes we cannot stand it and ask for leave, but it’s not granted.” Another worker surnamed Zhang said “Wages aren’t enough to live without overtime pay. I will quit if monthly wages drop below 4,000 RMB ($612).”
This report seriously questions Apple's sustainability reporting. CLW’s findings suggest severe discrepancies between what Apple tells the public and its investors about the working hours of workers making its products and the reality on the production line. The discrepancies in Apple's claimed working conditions and actual working conditions are important not only because they highlight problems in Apple's monitoring. The findings also clarify that despite being the most profitable company in history, Apple does not raise the bar to a commensurate level for workers making its products. They still earn minimum wage. They still depend on tremendous overtime to make ends meet.
The following are the primary findings of this report, followed by a summary, methodology, and a more detailed report.
Primary Findings
1) Workers are paid at a rate of 1.82 USD/hour. 2) On average, overtime pay as a percentage of workers’ gross wages is 42.4%. 3) Workers work more than 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. 83.8% workers’ monthly overtime hours exceed 80 hours. 4) In October 2015, 71.1% of workers’ average weekly working hours exceeded Apple 60-hour maximum limit. 5) Pegatron Shanghai workers must participate in an average of 15 minutes of mandatory pre- and post-shift meetings every day, or 90 minutes per week. If we assume that Pegatron Shanghai workers all have hidden, unpaid overtime, as CLW interviews suggest, then the total unpaid wages amount to US$11.85 million 6) The total value of Tim Cook’s stock growth up to February 2016 is equal to the combined annual base wages of 78,847 Pegatron workers. 7) The combined base wages of 1.6 million workers on Apple’s supply chain only accounts for 2.6% of Apple annual revenues.
Report Summary
1. The base wage paid to workers on Apple’s production line is too low, so workers need do excessive overtime work to support their lives in Shanghai.
· Overtime pay as a percentage of workers’ gross income is as high as 42.4%.
· The base wage (the local minimum wage) alone is not enough to meet workers’ living expenses in Shanghai.
Note: According to Shanghai Statistic Administration’s statistics, Shanghai urban residents’ average per capita expenditure in 2014 was 2,543 RMB, but the housing expenses (253 RMB) do not include house purchases or construction costs. Most workers are residents of other regions and cannot purchase housing, so living expenses were replaces with rent of 917 RMB, the value of the average rent in Shanghai Pudong District (location of Pegatron facility). 2,543 RMB – 253 RMB + 917 RMB = 3,207 RMB. Because the Shanghai Statistics Administration has not released the 2015 data yet, we used the 2014 expenditure data of Shanghai urban residents.
2. The weekly working hours and monthly overtime hours of workers on Apple’s production line far exceed the upper limits set Chinese law as well as statistics published by Apple.
· Chinese Labor Law requires that monthly overtime hours not exceed 36 hours, but at Pegatron Shanghai, only 1.1% of workers’ overtime hours are within this limit.
· In Apple’s “Supplier Responsibility 2015 Progress Report”, it is stated that in 2014, 92% of all workweeks were compliant with its 60-hour workweek standard set out by Apple. But according to pay stubs of Pegatron Shanghai workers in October 2015, 71.1% of workers’ average weekly working hours exceeded this limit.
Note: On the “Supplier Responsibility” segment of Apple’s website, Apple has posted a record of working hours in its supply chain from September and October 2015. Because Apple does not provide specific percentages in the chart, the “10%” and “9%” provided here are CLW’s conservative estimates. For details of Apple’s statistics, please see Figure 2.2c.
3. Apple’s profit distribution is severely imbalanced. it must take more responsibility to improve labor conditions
· Tim Cook’s stock bonus in 2011 was equivalent to the combined annual base wages of 98,862 Pegatron Shanghai workers, even though Pegatron only employs approximately 70,000 workers.[1]
· Apple earns sufficient profits to improve labor conditions. But if we assume that all 1.6 million workers in Apple’s supply chain (a number provided in Apple’s official report) earn the same base wage as Pegatron workers (which is the local minimum wage in Shanghai), the combined annual wages of all 1.6 million workers only equals 2.6% of Apple’s total revenue in fiscal year 2015. Apple’s efforts to protect labor rights are very limited.
Note: Tim Cook’s estimated stock returns are calculated according to Apple’s stock price. The value of Tim Cook’s stock growth at a given date is equal to: 376 million USD*stock price at given date/stock price on Aug 24 2011 - 376 million USD. For Apple’s stock price, please refer to http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/stockdetails?symbol=US:AAPL.
Note: The combined annual base wages of “all workers in Apple’s supply chain” is an estimate based on most (96.9%) Pegatron Shanghai workers’ individual annual base wage, 24,240 RMB, or $3,803.
4. Workers’ Hidden Weekly Overtime Hours are Not Paid
- According to CLW’s discussions with over 100 Pegatron workers and research on pay stubs in both September and October 2015, Pegatron Shanghai workers must participate in an average of 15 minutes of mandatory pre- and post-shift meetings every day, or 90 minutes per week. However, all of the workers interviewed expressed that the meetings are not included in their paid working time. Thus, workers’ actual weekly working time is 90 minutes (1.5 hours) longer than that written on their pay stubs.
- If we assume that Pegatron Shanghai workers all have hidden, unpaid overtime, as CLW interviews suggest, then the total unpaid wages amount to US$11.85 million, greater than Tim Cook’s 2015 annual income. (Note that this estimate is calculated based on workers’ hidden overtime work in September and October 2015, which is the busy season.)
- One male worker surnamed Zhang said, “In many departments, workers have meetings in the morning and evening before and after their shifts. It is said that we begin working at 8 am, but the meeting and attendance check start at about 7:40 am. We have meetings after working too, and all these are not calculated in working hours.”
- Taking the 1.5 hours of weekly unpaid overtime into consideration, the real circumstance for excessive overtime work is shown in the figures below. Note that after including unpaid overtime, nearly none of the workers at Pegatron have monthly overtime hours at or below the maximum set out by Chinese labor law.
Note: “+ hidden overtime” includes the daily meeting time (15 minutes a day, or 1.5 hours a week) in the calculation of weekly working hours, so the actually working hours under this calculation are 1.5 hours longer than the those under “Simple Calculation”. “+ hidden overtime & holidays” takes into account both daily hidden overtime as well as national holidays in September and October. If we assume a 5 regular work days in a workweek, then the weekly working hours formula is equal to: monthly overtime hours/(statutory working days in this month/5)+40 hours+1.5 Hours.
Note: In Apple’s fiscal year 2015 (September 27, 2014 to September 26, 2015), there are 248 statutory working days. Taking the 15 minutes of unpaid daily meeting time into account, each worker has 62 hours of annual hidden overtime work with an overtime wage of 17.4 RMB ($2,61) per hour, or 1,078.8 RMB ($162) of unpaid overtime wages per person for the entire year. Based on approximately 70,000 workers at Pegatron Shanghai workers, assuming all of them have unpaid hidden overtime hours, combined unpaid hidden overtime wages are 75,516,000 RMB, or $11,848,460.
Methodology
With the help of 18 workers/investigators, China Labor Watch collected 1161 pay stubs from Pegatron Shanghai in November and December. The workers/investigators work at different departments, and the pay stubs include employees of different positions and in different departments. Among the 1161 pay stubs, 1121 of them are in September and October, and 1061 are in October. According to our research and analysis, we believe these pay stubs can to a certain degree reflect workers’ wage and overtime work situation in Pegatron Shanghai. (Excel sheet with all raw data.) In addition to gathering pay stubs, China Labor Watch also conducted interviews with Pegatron workers.
Mingwei Liu (Associate Professor of Labor Studies and Employment Relations at Rutgers University) said the following about the methodology of this report:
“Multinational companies' CSR audits have been widely criticized for their inaccuracy and ineffectiveness. The latest report of CLW on working conditions in Apple's supplier Pegatron further strengthens this criticism. The data collected by CLW are impressive. Although the workers were not randomly sampled, the investigation methodology is reasonable and in fact often used by researchers due to the lack of sincere cooperation of employers. In my view, the data have good quality and reliability and the findings are largely consistent with the existing literature on factory conditions in China. All in all, this report will help us better understand the reality of working conditions at the Chinese end of electronics supply chains.”

We sent our 2015 report about Apple's supplier-Pegatron's labor abuses to Apple in October 2015, but have not received any response yet.
[1] Base wage = gross income - overtime pay – compensation. In Pegatron Shanghai, the base wage is equal to the local minimum wage of 2020 RMB (US$303/month, or 1.82US$/hour). The average monthly gross income is 4895 RMB (US$734)."ÿÿStudy Casts Doubts on Apple’s Ethical Standards

Executive Summary
In an interview with PBS journalist Charlie Rose in September 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked what values he considers most important beyond those of Apple.[1] Mr. Cook responded:
Treating people with dignity. Treating people the same. That everyone deserves a basic level of human rights, regardless of their color, regardless of their religion, regardless of their sexual orientation, regardless of their gender. That everyone deserves respect.
Right now, in Shanghai, China, a factory owned by the Taiwanese Pegatron Group is pushing out millions of units of the iPhone 6s for Apple. There, its young production workers toil six days a week in 12-hour shifts. Each day they are paid for 10 and half hours of work, not counting 15 minutes of unpaid meetings. The mandatory overtime shift runs from 5:30 pm until 8:00 pm. Most workers will not eat dinner before doing overtime because the 30-break given for a meal is not enough time.
Before overtime pay, workers making the iPhone earn only the local minimum wage of $318 per month, or about $1.85 per hour. This is not a living wage. Even if the factory did not mandate overtime as it does, workers would still depend on their 60-hour workweeks to get by.
After their long shifts, workers take a 30-minute shuttle bus back to their dorms where up to 14 people are crammed into a room. Mold grows pervasively along the walls. Bed bugs have spread throughout the dorm, and many workers are covered in red bug bites.
In his interview, Mr. Cook went on:
One of the best ways you can make sure that things are happening well is if people stand up and say, ""Something's happening that's not right here."" We've audited so deep in our supply chain. We do it constantly, looking for anything that's wrong, whether it's down to the -- there's a safety exit blocked.
While working undercover at the Pegatron factory in Shanghai, CLW’s investigator was never told the locations of emergency exits and never participated in an emergency drill. In fact, at the massive production facility, which employs up to 100,000 people, the investigator never even located an emergency exit.
Despite providing only about eight hours of pre-job safety training—where Chinese law requires 24 hours—Pegatron forces each new worker to sign a form that “certifies” that she has undergone 20 hours of safety training. A worker also must sign a trainer’s name on the form. The factory has workers quickly copy answers to the safety information quiz. These falsified forms are the types of documentation that are provided to Apple in their audits.
The production of an iPhone involves a great number of chemicals. Pegatron gives new workers an information sheet that contains a short list of toxic substances, including cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, and arsenic.[2] Yet no one tells workers anything about the location of these or other substances in the production process or how a person should protect herself from injury.
Something’s Not Right Here
Apple earned about $40 billion in profit last year. Its final quarter in that year, during which the company pulled in $18 billion, was the most lucrative quarter in the history of mankind. Apple is on course to earn over $50 billion in 2015.[3]
Mr. Cook is right when he encourages people to stand up and say, “Something’s happening that’s not right here.” But Mr. Cook has yet to clearly hear and respond when we say it: Something’s not right about the way Apple is doing business.
A portion of Apple’s historical profits is squeezed out of the low pay and illegally poor working conditions of over a million Chinese workers. In February 2015, a CLW report suggested that even using the most conservative estimates, Apple would need to invest up to 10 percent of its profits to ensure that workers making its products enjoy fundamentally improved working conditions. Yet the low pay, long hours, unpaid work, poor workplace safety, and despicable living conditions persist.
Something’s not right here.
Half of the workers hired at Pegatron are temp workers, though Chinese law only permits 10 percent of a workforce to be temporary labor. Under short-term contracts, these workers are treated as though they are disposable.
CLW’s Investigative Results: Two Years with Little Progress
In July 2013, CLW published an in-depth investigative report on working conditions in Shanghai and Suzhou-based factories of Pegatron Group. The report, Apple’s Unkept Promises, detailed an array of serious labor rights violations and compared the reality of working conditions in Pegatron plants to the commitments that Apple publicizes in regard to labor rights.
In the two years subsequent to the report, CLW also documented several cases of the sudden deaths of young iPhone workers due to abnormal or unexplained causes at Pegatron Shanghai. One instance was that of a child worker, Shi Zhaokun, who often worked 13 hours a day before his sudden death from pneumonia in October 2013. Another worker, 26-year old Tian Fulei, died in February 2015 of what the hospital deemed “sudden death.” Both workers had been employed on Pegatron’s iPhone production lines.
In September and October 2015, CLW conducted a new investigation of the working conditions at Pegatron’s Changshuo factory in Shanghai, which is currently producing the iPhone 6s. Findings are based on undercover research by a CLW investigator who was hired at Pegatron as a production line worker, as well as the calculation of data from 127 Pegatron worker pay stubs, about two-thirds of which cover working hours and wages from September 2015. During the investigation, CLW conducted dozens of interviews with Pegatron workers.
CLW’s newest investigation reveals 23 categories of legal and ethical labor rights violations at Pegatron Shanghai.
Applicants must pay for their mandatory pre-job physical exam. Despite Pegatron forcing workers to sign forms verifying that they have undergone 20 hours of pre-job safety training, workers only participate in eight hours of training. The Chinese statutory minimum is 24 hours. Moreover, the training does not touch upon the specific toxic chemicals which workers may handle every day. Pegatron even hands out information to new workers that lists a number of hazardous chemicals, including arsenic, hexavalent chromium, mercury, cadmium, and lead. Despite the significant toxicity of these chemicals, factory personnel provided no further information about the way in which these chemicals are used at Pegatron, the possible harm to human health, or how workers can protect themselves. Workers do not always receive protective equipment, and even if they do, a lack of awareness leads many people to use the equipment improperly.
Part of the risk to workers’ health is posed from excessive working hours. CLW’s investigation shows that in 2015, Pegatron Shanghai workers’ median overtime per month was 80 hours (83 hours in the busy season). During their 12-hour shifts, workers are given only 50 minutes for lunch and 30 minutes for dinner. the second meal break is so short that most workers forego dinner until they clock-out after 8 pm. CLW’s investigator worked on one iPhone motherboard unit every 3.75 seconds, standing for the entirety of his 10.5 hours of daily work. When the worker next to them takes lunches and dinners, workers must pick up their neighbor’s workload. Laboring under this schedule six days per week, during the busy season Pegatron workers earn about 4,000 RMB ($629) per month, of which approximately 1,750 RMB ($275) is overtime pay. In addition to this low-wage exploitation, the workers are required to attend unpaid meetings, equating to 15 minutes of unpaid overtime each day (6.5 hours per month).[4]
Pegatron tells its employees that it pays for both the employer and employee portions of mandated insurance contributions. Yet workers cannot verify the insurance contributions through their pay stubs, which no longer include any information about workers’ insurance. Pegatron’s employee service center also does not provide insurance figures. Furthermore, Pegatron does not contribute to workers’ housing funds, a mandatory benefit under Chinese law.
The poor conditions do not end in the workshop. Pegatron workers’ dorms house up to 14 people per room, where dark mold spreads along the walls and bed bugs are rampant.
Pegatron Shanghai Investigations: 2015 vs 2013
Unfortunately, the awful working and living conditions that Pegatron workers face in 2015 are generally no better than those witnessed in 2013. CLW compared 21 categories of findings from the 2013 and 2015 investigations of Pegatron Shanghai. Only one category revealed fundamental improvement: Whereas in 2013 Pegatron explicitly maintained discriminatory hiring practices against people of Tibetan or Uyghur ethnicity, people with dyed hair, and people over 35, in 2015 CLW did not observe such practices. (We note here that there is an unconfirmed issue of Pegatron’s policies toward women who are pregnant or preparing to become pregnant.[5])
In four other categories CLW found partial improvement. For example, if we compare September (typically a busy season) working hours from Pegatron pay stubs in 2015 and 2014, there has been limited improvement. The average workweek dropped from 63 hours to 60 hours. The percentage of compliance with Apple’s 60-hour workweek has risen from 7% in 2014 to 42% in 2015. In September 2014, 50% of workers put in over 90 hours of overtime for the month, but a year later, only 32% had done so. The maximum overtime recorded dropped from 130 hours to 119 hours. Despite these limited changes, 58% of workers continued to have workweeks in excess of Apple’s 60-hour workweek standard in September, and if we were to include the 90 minutes of unpaid meetings workers must attend per week, then the proportion of workers in excess of 60-hour workweeks would be notably higher. In any case, Apple’s 60-hour workweek does not conform to China’s overtime hour maximum. A 60-hour workweek equates to approximately 85 hours of overtime per month, but Chinese regulations allow no more than 36 hours.
11 of 21 categories of findings compared between 2013 and 2015 have not seen any meaningful change. For instance, temp workers are still used in proportions high above the legal maximum of 10%, pre-job safety training is still far short of the 24-hour minimum, some documentation related to working conditions continues to be fraudulent, and workers are still unpaid for daily meetings.
Most concerning is that based on CLW’s investigative findings, in five of 21 categories, problems have further deteriorated since 2013. Meal times are even more compressed than they were in 2013, now with only 30 minutes for dinner instead of 40 minutes. CLW did not collect any information about fines on workers in 2013, but in 2015’s probe documented fines of 50 RMB ($7.86) to 300 RMB ($47) for behaviors like crossing one’s legs or forgetting to wear one’s work ID. And the already crowded dorms now have a bed bug infestation.
The figure to the left demonstrates the comparison of categories from 2013 to 2015. It is important to note that in 2013, CLW’s investigator at Pegatron in Shanghai was hired via dispatch company, whereas in 2015 the investigator was hired directly. This means that additional violations may not have been documented in 2015, such as hiring discrimination against temp workers or dispatch companies failing to pay all wages and insurance for temp workers.

Apple Must Live Up To Its Legal and Social Responsibilities
CLW has previously detailed how Apple has the greatest control of working conditions among all actors in its supply chain. It is not a question of whether Apple must ensure that workers making its products enjoy fair and safe working conditions. It is only a question of when Apple will make good on its commitments.
CLW believes that if Apple institutes the following measures throughout all of its suppliers, it will have taken a significant step toward improving workers’ conditions:
* The specific amount of social insurance paid to workers should be transparent to them, included on their pay stubs and available when workers make inquiries to the company., * Factories should provide all mandatory insurance in full, including the housing fund., * Factories should restrict the hiring of temporary (or dispatch) labor at a given factory to no more than 10% of the workforce, in compliance with Chinese law., * Workers should not be made to work without corresponding pay., * The base wage rate should be increased significantly above the local minimum wage so that workers do not need to depend on overtime to make a living., * Worker housing should be hygienic and more spacious., * Pre-job safety training should last for at least 24 hours, as required by law, and workers should be taught specifically what chemicals and hazards they will encounter in their positions and how to mitigate health risks., * All workers should receive appropriate protective equipment and be taught how to properly use it before beginning work., * Industrial processes should be adjusted to allow workers a chance to both stand and sit or lean while they work., * Factories should ensure that workers have pre-job, on-the-job, and pre-resignation physical exams, as required by law, for which the factory pays for all fees., * Let workers elect enterprise-level union representatives that can actually represent worker interests.,

[2] China RoHS (Restriction of the Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic equipment) is a set of standards based on previously instituted European Union standards (the latest version of which is 2011/65/EU), which restricts the use of six substances: lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Pegatron’s requirement of the chemicals in general fall below the RoHS limits, but it RoHS standards only represent chemical contents in final product, not worker exposure during production processes. In addition, Pegatron’s arsenic standard is 1,000 ppm, far above the safety exposure limit recommended by NIOSH in the United States (50 ppm). A more detailed description of these chemicals and the hazards posed to human health can be found on page 25 of this report and in Appendix A.

During the investigation, women who said they planned to become pregnant soon were separated from the investigator’s group of applicants, and CLW was unable to confirm whether those women were hired by Pegatron."ÿÿSomething's Not Right Here: Poor Working Conditions Persist at Apple Supplier Pegatron

Workers in Chinese factories making Apple products continue to be poorly treated, with exhausted employees falling asleep on their 12-hour shifts, the BBC has said after an undercover investigation.
Reporters who took jobs at the Pegatron factories found workers regularly exceeded 60 hours a week – contravening the company’s guidance – and that standards on ID cards, dormitories, work meetings and juvenile workers were also breached.
The broadcaster said promises made by Apple to protect workers in the wake of a spate of suicides at supplier Foxconn in 2010 were “routinely broken”.
Apple said that it disagreed with the BBC’s conclusions.
The BBC filmed a health and safety exam at a Pegatron factory in which workers chanted out answers in unison, meaning there was little chance of failing.
The footage also appeared to show workers had no choice to opt out of doing night shifts or working while standing.
One reporter had to work 18 days in a row despite repeated requests for a day off, the BBC reported.
In response to the programme, Apple told the BBC: “We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions.
“We work with suppliers to address shortfalls, and we see continuous and significant improvement, but we know our work is never done.”
The company said it was common for workers to sleep during breaks but it would investigate whether they were falling asleep while working.
It said it monitored the hours worked by more than a million workers, and that staff at Taiwanese-owned Pegatron averaged 55 hours a week.
The investigation by BBC flagship programme Panorama also found that tin from illegal mines in Indonesia where children work in dangerous conditions could be entering Apple’s supply chain.
Apple, which promotes ethically sourced minerals, told the BBC it was attempting to drive changes, and that withdrawing from Indonesian mines altogether would be “the lazy and cowardly path, since it would do nothing to improve the situation”.

Why PETA Kills
Why does PETA kill cats and dogs by the thousands instead of finding them homes? Simply, PETA does not believe in pet ownership. Ingrid Newkirk has called pet ownership “an abysmal situation.” She further elaborated on her goal for destroying the human-pet bond: “If people want toys, they should buy inanimate objects. If they want companionship, they should seek it with their own kind.”
“In the end, I think it would be lovely if we stopped this whole notion of pets altogether,” she has said.
Ridiculously, PETA has argued that outdoor cats should be summarily killed instead of allowed to live. In a 2014 interview with the Washington Post, Newkirk argued that outdoor cats would be better off dead because they might contract a future illness or be hit by a car in the future. In PETA’s twisted mind, it’s more humane to just euthanize the animals than for a hypothetical harm to befall them in the future. Similarly, PETA has also argued in court that elephants are better off being killed than living in American zoos where they are well cared for.
PETA’s pro-killing attitude is part of its core—and it should shock any animal lover.


Proof PETA Kills
The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) requires all animal shelters to report the number of cats and dogs they take in each year. The records indicate how many cats and dogs were reclaimed by their owners, adopted out, transferred to other Virginia releasing agencies (i.e. animal shelters and animal control), transferred to out-of-state releasing agencies, died of natural causes, euthanized (killed), and how many the shelter held alive at the end of the calendar year. We added the dogs and cats euthanized and divided by the total number of dogs and cats taken in excluding those held only for sterilization surgery to determine the percentage of dogs and cats PETA killed in a given year. In 2009, Virginia modified its policy and eliminated animals held for sterilization from the records.
We obtained the reports by filing public records requests under Virginia’s sunshine laws with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The information for years 2004-2010 is also available on the VDACS website for public inspection (animals classified as “other” from 2004-2009 include those reported by PETA as held for sterilization).

Visit PETA’s “Shelter”
State Inspector likens PETA’s “Shelter” to a “Euthanasia Clinic”
Recent documents uncovered by PETAKillsAnimals.com indicate that the Commonwealth of Virginia was so shocked by the number of animals PETA kills each year that the state inspector attempted to revoke PETA’s license to operate a shelter.
In 2010, a Virginia resident called PETA to ask if it operated an animal shelter. PETA said no. Apparently perplexed, she sent PETA’s response to the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), the government agency responsible for overseeing shelters and animal welfare matters in the state. Responding to the complaint, Dr. Daniel Kovich, an investigator with the VDACS, conducted an inspection of PETA’s animal shelter at its Virginia headquarters in July 2010. Dr. Kovich determined “the facility does not contain sufficient animal enclosures to routinely house the number of animals annually reported as taken into custody.”
This is probably because most animals taken in by PETA aren’t housed for very long. After reviewing two months worth of records, Kovich found that 245 of the 290 animals–84 percent–that PETA took into custody were killed within 24 hours. Only 17 were reported as adopted or in foster homes. Kovich noted that PETA’s shelter did not meet PETA’s own published guidelines for operating a humane animal shelter.
At the time of the visit, Kovich found a mere three animals were in PETA’s “shelter” which apparently consists of three rooms on PETA’s 4th floor, nestled amongst cubicles and conference rooms. None of the animals available for adoption, and PETA’s representative indicated the shelter was not accessible to the public.
Kovich reviewed the disposition of cats and dogs that were either euthanized or adopted/transferred out in the previous six years and found the adoption/transfer rate at PETA’s shelter dropped from an embarrassing 14 percent in 2004 to an abysmal 0.7 percent in 2009. In other words, of the 2317 dogs and cats in PETA’s shelter 99.3 percent were killed.

Based on his investigation, Kovich made the following determination:
The findings of this site visit support the assertion that PETA does not operate a facility that meets the statutory definition of an animal shelter as the primary purpose is not to find permanent adoptive homes for animals.
PETA’s lawyer responded to VDACS arguing that a legal technicality protected their status as an animal shelter.

PETA’s Lame Defense
Is PETA euthanizing perfectly adoptable dogs and cats?
Since PETAKillsAnimals.com debuted in 2005, people have frequently asked PETA why it kills so many animals. PETA dubiously claims it does not run a “traditional animal shelter” and that it puts down animals that are too sick or injured to carry on. There are good reasons to believe this claim is inaccurate.
In November 2014, WAVY-TV reported that PETA employees had allegedly taken a family’s Chihuahua without cause in broad daylight from the family’s home. A surveillance video showed a van branded with the PETA logo pull up in the driveway followed by a worker seizing the dog and driving off. Wilbur Cerate, the dog’s owner, said that PETA employees later returned to his home with a fruit basket and news that the dog had been killed. The Accomack County Sheriff charged the employees with larceny. PETA refused comment to WAVY despite numerous requests.
In 2007, two PETA employees were tried for animal cruelty and littering in North Carolina after they were caught in a late night stakeout dumping the bodies of dead dogs and cats in a dumpster. Evidence presented during the trial showed that PETA employees killed animals they considered “adorable” and “perfect.” Likewise, witnesses at the trial testified that PETA told them they “shouldn’t have a problem at all finding homes” for dogs left in their care. Other North Carolina shelter personnel testified that they were under the impression PETA would find homes for the animals they handed over to PETA. These impressions were incorrect. PETA picked up dogs and cats from animal shelters in North Carolina and killed them before they even left the state. Beyond the evidence presented at the trial, PETA has never backed up its claim with any evidence to suggest that it only takes in injured or otherwise unadoptable dogs and cats. See images of the dogs PETA put down without giving them a chance at life.

PETA Sued for Killing
PETA is Facing a $9.7 Million Lawsuit for Killing a Family Pet
In 2014, PETA was contracted to help remove stray dogs in Eastern Virginia. But local resident Wilber Zarate alleges in a $9.7 million lawsuit filed in Norfolk that PETA officials paid children to lure his family dog off of his porch. When the kids failed to entice Maya, a Chihuahua, PETA officials trespassed onto Mr. Zarate’s porch and nabbed the pooch.
When Mr. Zarate’s niece contacted PETA about Maya’s disappearance the next day, PETA denied even being in the area that day. When she told the representative at PETA that she had security footage of the dognapping the representative abruptly hung up. Two days later, the PETA employees who had abducted Maya returned with a fruit basket and the news that Maya was dead.
Further violating the law, PETA euthanized Maya within hours of abduction instead of waiting the legally required five days. The Commonwealth of Virginia fined PETA for this infraction.
Mr. Zarate’s daughter, who he bought Maya for as a Christmas present years before, began mourning immediately. “[Cynthia] cried for weeks, became lethargic, lost sleep, refrained from eating and lost weight,” according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit is pending and is set for trial in 2017.


PETA’s Dirty Tactics
PETA targets your kids with comic books and protests
 In 2003, in more than 15 states, the group handed out a graphic comic titled “Your Mommy Kills Animals” to children accompanying women wearing fur outside holiday performances of The Nutcracker and other theatrical shows.
Denver’s Rocky Mountain News classified PETA’s attempt “to manipulate adults by traumatizing their children” as “despicable.” The Omaha World- Herald declared, “it’s the vulnerable children who will likely suffer for the anxiety-inducing insensitivity of the attack on what should be a happy, family-oriented outing.”
Dr. Jeffrey Dolgan, chief of psychology at Denver’s Children’s Hospital, told The Denver Post that PETA’s “Your Mommy Kills Animals” campaign is “beyond insensitive.”
The group also featured convicted arsonist Rodney Coronado as a guest columnist in Grrr! Kids Bite Back, a defunct periodical described as “PETA’s magazine for students aged 8 to 14.”
PETA’s Teachkind teaching aids have involved themes that draw connections between African-American slaves and livestock animals. They have asked students to “compare the progression of the civil rights movement in the U.S. to the current animal rights movement.” There is more. In 2006, we BROKEN LINKS released this report [English only] which we updated in 2008 as a comprehensive examination of PETA’s propaganda aimed at kids. BROKEN LINKS
PETA’s Connections to Violent Extremists
PETA gave grants to arsonist Rodney Coronado and the eco-terrorist group Earth Liberation Front.
Former PETA vegetarian campaign coordinator Bruce Friedrich told an animal rights convention that “blowing stuff up and smashing windows” is “a great way to bring about animal liberation,” adding, “Hallelujah to the people who are willing to do it.”
In 2002, PETA president Ingrid Newkirk told The Boston Herald: “More power to SHAC [the violent Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty] if they can get someone’s attention.” Six of SHAC’s core members were subsequently convicted for their attacks on businesses, with four serving between three and six years in jail. The PETA Foundation was formerly run by Neal Barnard, president of the misnamed Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. PCRM has been linked with FBI-designated terrorist groups, including SHAC and the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). In 2001, Barnard co-signed a series of threatening letters with the U.S. president of SHAC, who was convicted on federal terrorism charges in 2006. Dr. Jerry Vlasak, the ALF “Press Officer” who is known for openly advocating the use of violence to further animal liberation goals, was a PCRM spokesperson when he first called for the “political assassination” of medical research scientists in 2003.
PETA also gave $2,000 to David Wilson, then a national Animal Liberation Front spokesperson.
PETA paid $27,000 for the legal defense of Roger Troen, who was arrested for taking part in an October 1986 burglary and arson at the University of Oregon.


PETA’s Radical Agenda




Ingrid Newkirk: Radical Animal Liberation Activist
Ingrid Newkirk isn’t just the President of PETA, she’s also a militant activist. She’s soaked herself in fake blood, of course, but she’s also been arrested more than 20 times. And she’s an avowed supporter of the terrorist Animal Liberation Front.
Newkirk wrote a book called Free the Animals! The Untold Story of the U.S. Animal Liberation Front and Its Founder, ‘Valerie.’ In it she writes that she has “become somewhat used to jumping on a plane with copies of freshly purloined documents and hurriedly calling news conferences to discuss the ALF’s findings.” In 1993, Newkirk arranged an interview for TIME magazine with “Valerie.” Later, the animal-rights movement would be abuzz with speculations that Valerie was just one of Newkirk’s PETA employees. The entire episode has suggested what many federal law enforcement officers have openly speculated: that ALF and PETA may be populated with identical personnel, the only difference being a setting sun and a ski mask.
Newkirk gives interviews to ALF’s publications, supports the legal defense efforts of ALF criminals (with PETA’s money), has been subpoenaed in regard to her ALF connections, and has even been accused in court documents of participation in the ALF arson of a Michigan State University research lab.
In the 1970s, Newkirk worked for Montgomery County (Maryland), and then for the District of Columbia, as an animal protection officer and deputy sheriff, before becoming DC’s first female poundmaster in 1978. She co-founded PETA in 1980 with established animal-rights activist Alex Pacheco. Since then, PETA and Newkirk have become synonymous. Former employees refer to PETA as “the cult of Newkirk.”
PETA opposes testing medications on animals, even if they could lead to a cure for AIDS.

PETA President Ingrid Newkirk told Vogue that “Even if animal tests produced a cure for AIDS, we’d be against it.”
PETA made a $5000 cash payment to Josh Harper, a leader of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, a violent extremist group that intimidated, threatened, and attacked people affiliated with a medical research facility
The head of the anti-animal testing animal rights group the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) was formerly president of The PETA Foundation.
PETA awarded a grant of over $70,000 to Rodney Coronado, who was then accused and later convicted of arson against a Michigan research facility.
PETA solicited volunteers to infiltrate facilities as “behind-the-scenes heroes for the animals

“Ethical Treatment” is Optional for PETA’s Celebrities.
These celebrities are PETA activists, but have shown flexibility with the organization’s forceful call for strict vegetarianism, also known as veganism.

Pamela Anderson’s Dodge Viper (auctioned to benefit PETA) had a “luxurious leather interior.”
Jenna Jameson was photographed fishing, slurping oysters, and wearing a leather jacket just weeks after launching an anti-leather campaign for PETA.
Morrissey got an official okay from PETA after eating at a steakhouse.
Dita von Teese has written about her love of furs and foie gras.
Steve-O built a career on abusing small animals on film.
The officially “anti-fur” Eva Mendes has worn fur anyway.

PETA’s Religious Nonsense
PETA’s religious campaigns include a website that claims–despite ample evidence to the contrary–that Jesus Christ was a vegetarian. PETA holds protests at houses of worship, even suing one church that tried to protect its members from Sunday-morning harassment. Its billboards taunt Christians with the message that hogs “died for their sins.”
PETA insists, contrary to centuries of rabbinical teaching, that the Jewish ritual of kosher slaughter shouldn’t be allowed. Its infamous “Holocaust on Your Plate” campaign compared the Jewish victims of Nazi genocide to farm animals.
Want to see more? We issued a report in 2005 that comprehensively debunked PETA’s religious campaign literature.

Published May 29, 2019 by . Last Updated May 31, 2019. PETA is taking on Big Pharma companies that have forced mice or other small animals to swim for their lives. In the laboratories of Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, experimenters have dropped mice, rats, and gerbils into inescapable containers of water and watched as the terrified animals frantically tried to escape. In the test, the animals struggle to stay afloat for several minutes and experimenters see how long it takes for them to give up. If you wonder how such abuse could possibly be relevant to human health, so do many scientists. So we’re hitting back: A PETA neuroscientist took the floor at the companies’ shareholder meetings, challenging executives over the utter uselessness of this torturous near-drowning test and demanding that the companies stop using it in their laboratories. And outside the meetings, PETA supporters protested.We were there at Pfizer’s annual meeting on April 25. We were there to confront Eli Lilly at its shareholder conference on May 6. And today, May 29, as Bristol-Myers Squibb shareholders are meeting, PETA is there, too.Our message to Big Pharma is simple: PETA won’t stop until companies pledge never again to torment animals in this cruel and bogus test. Our neuroscientists will be inside boardrooms delivering hard facts to investors, and we’ll demonstrate outside to make the public aware. Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie have already banned the use of the near-drowning test following efforts by PETA—as has DSM Nutritional Products, headquartered in the Netherlands. With the help of our supporters, we will completely relegate this experiment to the history books.

Published October 31, 2019 by . Last Updated November 7, 2019. Victory! Following nearly a year of PETA pressure, the world’s third-largest pharmaceutical company, Pfizer, has committed to no longer conducting or funding cruel forced swim test experiments on animals. These tests—in which small animals are dropped into inescapable beakers of water and forced to swim to keep from drowning—dubiously claim to shed light on human depression. However, the test is less accurate than a coin toss in determining the effectiveness of antidepressant medications, and 18 years of these experiments at Pfizer didn’t lead to any marketable drugs to treat human depression.According to published papers, Pfizer employees had used at least 1,270 mice and rats in forced swim test experiments since 1991. This victory means no more small animals will be terrified in near-drowning experiments.PETA’s bold protests against Pfizer pushed the company to join other leading pharmaceutical giants—including Johnson & Johnson, Roche, AbbVie, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Sage Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, and Novo Nordisk A/S—that have banned the forced swim test. This exciting progress for animals means that companies agree with PETA: It’s time to invest in humane, advanced, animal-free research methods that might actually help human patients.The bottom line: The forced swim test is cruel, and it’s bad science. These experiments do nothing more than terrify animals and delay the development of new effective treatments that are so desperately needed.What You Can DoMore than half a million PETA supporters took action, e-mailing Pfizer to urge the company to commit to banning the forced swim test—and it worked.

A 60-day pilot program in the Pacific Northwest led by the Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS. Washington, DC) has concluded that a secondary sorting facility model is a viable option to help meet increasing demand for recycled materials. Funded by the American Chemistry Council, AmSty, Berry Global, the Carton Council, LyondellBasell, Metro (Portland Metro Regional Government), Milliken and PLASTICS, the group set out to determine how a wider range of materials can be captured from residential recycling streams.
The Pacific Northwest Secondary Sorting Demonstration Project made use of a portable secondary material recovery facility (MRF) that operated for 60 days in Portland, receiving, sorting and measuring the possible recovery from two types of material streams from four MRFs located in Oregon and Washington. Titus MRF Services (Danville, CA) operated the facility and provided the equipment for the project.

Why are these people smiling? Because the pilot recycling project successfully demonstrated that a secondary material recovery facility sized to serve the populations of Oregon and Washington would have a positive effect on increasing material recovery and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The project report noted that the present system of recycling has limitations involving resident participation. the quantity and quality of material available for processing. consumer confusion about what and how to recycle. and materials in the recycling stream that are difficult to sort manually. Currently, the report noted, PET and HDPE bottles are usually present in quantities that can justify investment in optical sorting equipment and are also relatively easy to sort manually. “These materials are often used for specific applications in which other resins are not used—PET water and soda bottles, HDPE-natural milk jugs and HDPE-color detergent and shampoo bottles,” said the report.
The analysis not only highlighted some of the confusion within the existing collection program, it provided a glimpse of how the addition of a secondary MRF in the region, coupled with an expansion of collection programs, could increase material recovery. Most notable, said the report, was “the recovery of non-program polypropylene and polystyrene. More than 40% of the polypropylene recovered was non-program material, and demand from existing reclaimers of polypropylene is not currently being met.”
The polystyrene (PS) data was “regionally significant” in that almost 90% of the PS recovered was non-program material, and an emerging technology developed by Agilyx (now Regenyx) is located within the Portland Metro region. “If recycling program planners were to add these materials to the collection program along with secondary sorting capacity, it would yield much-needed feedstock for these existing markets,” said the report.
Materials recovered in this study included polyethylene, mixed paper, cartons, polypropylene, PS, and PET bottles and thermoforms. The results of the project suggest that a regional secondary sorting MRF sized to serve the populations of both Oregon and Washington would:
Increase material recovery or landfill diversion by more than 50,000 tons (100 million pounds) per year, equivalent to 2,500 semi-trailer truckloads of recovered materials bound for recycling facilities.
Increase the recovery rate by 3% to 6% without significant program changes or investments.
Generate 46 green jobs per secondary MRF.
Reduce the generation of greenhouse gases by more than 130,000 tons per year, which is equivalent to taking more than 27,600 cars off the road (according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator).
Enable future expansion of the accepted materials list without needing to retrofit primary MRFs.
Provide accountability for all collected recyclable materials and eliminate the risk of potential mismanagement and pollution.
The report provided some good advice for confused consumers: Ignore the numbers. Ignore the arrows. Those are for industry use only. Sort by shape!
Tony Radoszewski, President and CEO  of PLASTICS, commented, “The project data shows the value that can be extracted from landfill-bound or mixed materials. It is our hope that the data from this report can help inform state and local decision makers on how to improve our recovery systems.”"ÿÿPacific Northwest pilot recycling project shows promising results

            Reusable cups and travel mugs have soared in popularity in recent years – and not without good reason.
Savvy coffee drinkers are not only helping to reduce the waste created by disposable cups, which are hard to recycle – they’re also earning coffee shop discounts that could save you over £100 a year.
Now’s a great time to make the switch, too, as our recent test of reusable cups and travel mugs has uncovered four brilliant Best Buys, including our best ever reusable coffee cup.
We put nine newcomers to the test, including models from popular brands such as Chilly’s, Corkcicle, S’well and Thermos, as well as some budget options, including a cheap £5 travel mug from Wilko.
Discover our top picks in our guide to the best reusable cups and travel mugs.
Five reasons to switch to reusable cups
Not yet convinced? Here’s why we love reusable cups:
1) They help to reduce plastic waste
Takeaway coffee cups have a thin plastic lining which makes them difficult to process for recycling. As a result, most of the disposable coffee cups we throw away end up in landfill.
Reusable coffee cups, on the other hand, are designed to last for years – if cared for properly.
Most can be recycled when they eventually wear out, and some, like the rCup, are even made of recycled materials. In the rCup’s case, used coffee cups – there’s even a Costa version made from recycled Costa cups.

Costa’s contactless cup – the coffee chain also sells a smart reusable cup you can pat with. Get our first impressions.

2) Save money at coffee shops
Many coffee shop chains, including Pret, Costa and Starbucks, offer discounts to customers who bring their own cup. If you’re a regular coffee drinker, you could save more than £100 a year.
Below is a summary of the discounts on offer and the potential saving you could make annually, based on buying a standard coffee five times a week.
3) You don’t have to splash out to get a good one
We’ve tested reusable cups and travel mugs ranging in price from just £1 to more than £30, and have uncovered some great value options.
Even the pricier models will pay for themselves within a few months if you make use of the savings on offer in coffee stores. You could also bring your own drink from home, saving you even more.
Check our reusable cup and travel mug reviews to find the best one for your budget.
4) They can keep drinks hot for several hours
Paper takeaway cups don’t offer much in the way of insulation, so your drink is likely to turn cold quickly, particularly when it’s chilly outside.
Equally, they don’t offer much protection for your hands from the scalding heat within.
Opting for a reusable cup should help your drink stay toasty for longer and keep your fingers from frying.
We measure how well each cup keeps in the heat and have found that some keep your drink piping hot, while others lose heat rapidly. Make sure you invest in a nicely insulating model by checking our reusable coffee cup reviews before you buy.
5) They can prevent leaks and spills
Many reusable cups have a sliding cover to prevent liquid escaping if you’re dashing around, or being jostled on a busy commute. Our tests found that the effectiveness of the cover varies though, with some offering better splash protection than others.
If you’re looking for something that you can chuck in your bag without any risk of spills, you’re best off opting for a travel mug, as these are designed to be more leak-proof than reusable cups.
We’ve tested both, so browse our top travel mug and reusable cup picks to find your perfect match.

How to save (even more) money on your coffee habit
Taking advantage of reusable cup incentives at coffee shops is a great way to cut costs. But buying a coffee machine and making your brew at home could give you even more substantial savings.
By swapping coffee shop espressos for homemade ones, you could save up to £6000 over five years, based on buying a daily coffee during the week versus making it at home.
How much you could save depends on the type of coffee machine you buy, as some – such as pod machines – can be more expensive per cup than others.

Launched in 2009 by Yael Aflalo, Reformation is best known for its knockout party dresses and cute mix’n’match separates. Based in downtown Los Angeles, this fashion brand states that sustainability is at the core of everything it does. But is that really the case? Environmental Impact Reformation is in many ways an environmental leader, which is why its environmental rating is ‘Great’. It uses eco-friendly materials, like Tencel and recycled materials, and some of its products are Bluesign and Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The brand also reuses offcuts created during the manufacturing process, reduces its carbon footprint by manufacturing much of its range close to where it is sold, and uses a reputable carbon offset program. It provides a RefScale for each of its garments, breaking down the item’s impact on the environment for you, and even uses recycled paper hangers and minimises the use of packaging with 100% consumer waste materials. Broadly speaking Reformation is proving that you can look cute and protect the earth at the same time But it isn’t perfect. Reformation doesn’t publish enough information about how or where its products are dyed, and we’re concerned about the impact of the chemicals used in its viscose process. For example, on one of the products it says: “Viscose–aka rayon–is man-made cellulosic fiber made from wood pulp.” Reformation states it’s doing its best to source wood from sustainably managed forests with the help of Canopy. However, while the viscose was woven in a chemical-free mill, further up the chain toxic chemicals (caustic soda) were almost certainly used to create the viscose yarn out of wood pulp. Labour Conditions Most of the design and manufacturing of Reformation’s limited-edition collections is completed in the factory headquarters in downtown Los Angeles. It has a Code of Conduct that covers all of the ILO Four Fundamental Freedoms principles, and is working toward paying 100% living wages across the board. Over three-quarters of Reformation’s management team are women (you go girls) or people from underrepresented populations. The brand also traces most of its supply chain including all of the final and second stages of production, and visits its suppliers regularly. For all these reasons, we rated Reformation’s labour conditions ‘Good’. Animal Welfare Reformation’s animal impact is rated ‘Not Good Enough’. This is because, while Reformation doesn’t use fur, down, angora, or other exotic animal skin, and uses recycled wool, it does occasionally use leather and exotic animal hair. With so many fantastic leather alternatives out there, there is no need to continue exploiting our animal friends for profit. Editor's note: Cover image via Reformation.

Video Reveals That Neglected, Lame Cows Suffer in Pain and Filth at Pennsylvania Dairy—Just for CheeseVideo     Take Action   Donate Now APETA eyewitness exposé of Reitz Dairy Farm—a Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, farm that kept approximately 300 cows and scores of calves—reveals that cows being milked were denied care for painful grapefruit-size masses that oozed blood and pus, struck over and over on their sensitive udders, and found dead lying in manure.These cows are milked for the National Farmers Organization, which says it ships most of its Pennsylvania dairy suppliers’ milk to Lanco-Pennland, maker of Pennland Pure cheeses.Please take action today to prevent more cows and calves from enduring this and more!Calves Kept Penned in Their Own Waste—With More Suffering in Store for ThemThe cycle of misery at Reitz Dairy Farm begins in filthy barns, where calves, who were separated from their mothers shortly after birth, were forced to lie in their own manure and urine day after day. They were denied any opportunity to set foot outdoors.Eventually, female calves are inseminated—just like their mothers—and exploited for their milk. After their bodies wear out from the constant cycle of pregnancy and lactation, cows used in the dairy industry are shipped off to be slaughtered—the same terrifying fate that male calves face.Calves who were separated from their mothers shortly after birth had to lie in their own manure and urine, day after day, unable even to set foot on the grass outdoors.Lame Mother Cows Left to Lie in Manure, Milked Daily for CashInjured and ailing cows were put in what was called the “outback barn,” which was full of accumulated feces and urine. Allowing wounded cows to lie in such filth can cause arthritis and severe lameness. Cows at Reitz Dairy Farm limped along gingerly on floors slick with waste, including in the very room where the milk that they had produced for their calves was taken from them to be sold and made into cheese.One cow, named Caroline by PETA’s eyewitness, developed painful lameness and favored one of her hooves. Her condition worsened, but the farm manager didn’t provide her with any care. Instead, she was put in a pen full of manure—which could cause deep foot infections, abscesses, disease, and more. Eventually, PETA’s eyewitness found her dead.Caroline was lame and left to lie in feces and urine. Weeks later, she was found dead in a barn stall.Cows Repeatedly Kicked and Beaten With a Cane—Even on their UddersOne cow became trapped in a stall after being milked. Rather than helping to free her, a worker hit her on the hindquarters, legs, and udder nearly 60 times with a hard cane—deliberately targeting her sensitive udder. He also kicked her over and over again.He repeatedly struck another cow on her delicate udder, too, even though she had just given birth and her newborn had just been torn away from her.Daisy was denied care for her swollen hocks, one of which was as large as a grapefruit.Denied Care for Swollen, Ruptured Leg Joints Leaking Pus and BloodMany cows’ leg joints were severely swollen—a painful condition that can be caused by trauma (like being struck or jabbed) or by constantly lying in filthy stalls with no bedding, like those at Reitz Dairy Farm, where cows tried to rest when not being milked. One veterinary expert who reviewed the eyewitness footage said, “The excessive waste accumulation and harsh, abrasive concrete stalls without bedding is causing and exacerbating injury and illness in the animals.”PETA’s eyewitness found that the left hind leg joint—or “hock”—of a cow he named Anna was inflamed and larger than a grapefruit. When asked if she would be provided with veterinary care, the farm manager replied, “Not for swollen hocks.” Week after week, Anna’s painful hock grew larger and larger, until finally it burst—leaving blood and pus running down her leg.Like Anna, Daisy—and many other cows—were given no care for their swollen, inflamed hocks, some of which were open and oozing blood or a thick yellow discharge.Approximately 60% of the cows who were being milked had leg joints that were swollen, ulcerated, or missing hair. Anna, Daisy, and others endured these painful injuries week after week—but were still hooked up to machines that took their milk for human consumption every day.Many cows’ leg joints were inflamed, raw, bleeding, and oozing pus.A Painful Eye, a Perforated Teat, and More—but no Vet CareThe left eye socket of another cow, named Betsy by PETA’s eyewitness, was covered with protruding tissue and secreted fluid, which an expert stated is “is indicative of eye irritation and pain.” Still, the farm manager indicated that nothing would be done for her.Other cows had wounds on their sensitive udders or teats.Milk leaked from a hole in one cow’s teats, increasing her risk of mastitis, a painful infection of the udder common in cows used for their milk.When they were not being milked, cows lay in their own waste, increasing their risk of developing infections that lead to pus in milk sold for human consumption.“The worst problems shown on this video were the swollen hocks. One was almost the size of a basketball. These are some of the WORST hocks I have ever seen. These cows would definitely be suffering. It is obvious that the farmer was not taking steps to prevent swollen hocks. Some of these cows should have been culled before they deteriorated to such poor conditions. This is a poorly managed dairy where cows were suffering.” —World-renowned meat- and dairy-industry expert Dr. Temple GrandinBetsy’s left eye socket was covered with protruding tissue and caused her pain. Nothing was done for her condition.The Long History of Cruelty at Reitz Dairy FarmThis isn’t the first time that cows have been found suffering at this farm. In 2009, PETA documented that cows who were in so much pain that they couldn’t even stand up were electro-shocked, kicked, or jabbed with a blade. Some were left to deteriorate until they were too weak to stand up, and downed cows were just left for dead.In the years since, worker after worker from the farm has blown the whistle about the neglect, abuse, and filth at Reitz Dairy Farm—which has shocked even those who have long worked in the dairy industry. One whistleblower reported that farm owner Lloyd Reitz Sr. and his son, Andy Reitz, slit conscious cows’ throats, made cows lie in their own waste, left sick and injured cows untreated, and more.What You Can DoThis exposé spotlights just one farm and reveals only some of the routine cruelty in the dairy industry. Cows carry their young for nine months—just like humans—and produce milk for their own babies. But on every dairy farm, their calves are taken away from them shortly after birth, and their milk is sold for human consumption. The surest way to spare cows and calves all this pain and misery is to stop buying cheese and other dairy “products” and go vegan today.If you think you have what it takes to carry out eyewitness investigations like this one, we want to hear from you. Click here to share your gratitude with the eyewitness who revealed the cruelty at this farm.Finally, please urge the National Farmers Organization to reconsider whether it and its customers want to continue being affiliated with suffering and filth such as that documented at Reitz Dairy Farm.

 Published October 31, 2019 by .  More than 25 years ago, PETA’s intense campaign against General Motors essentially ended the automotive industry’s cruel practice of smashing live animals into walls at high speeds as part of deadly and barbaric car-crash tests. It was junk science then, and it’s junk science now.Even so, in China—despite the existence of sophisticated animal-free models—experimenters continue to fasten abused, frightened animals into car seats and crash them into walls until their bodies are bloody, bruised, and mangled.International Journal of Crashworthiness Experimenters at China’s Research Institute for Traffic Medicine strap live pigs into car seats and then slam them into a wall at high speeds. Pigs don’t naturally sit up in car seats. (Notice how their front legs had to be tied and held up for this test.) Their anatomy is also very different from that of humans, so the data obtained from these horrific animal experiments aren’t applicable to human car-crash victims. Non-animal research methods using state-of-the-art manikins or human cadavers are readily available and already in use by major automakers around the world.PETA contacted the nation’s Research Institute for Traffic Medicine and Daping Hospital to urge them to stop using live animals in crude car-crash tests. No regulations exist there that would require such horrific experiments to be performed.Live pigs and dogs are pulverized in these tests, leaving them with broken bones and severe internal injuries before they’re killed and dissected.Based on their own publications, it’s clear that China’s Research Institute for Traffic Medicine and Daping Hospital have conducted the following violent experiments:Experimenters forced dogs onto an L-shaped rigid seat in a human sitting position using cloth restraints. They then affixed a disc to their heads with a steel wire rope, sewed sensors into their heads, held their heads up by their ears, dropped a hammer to hit the disc (causing the dogs’ heads to violently thrust backwards and resulting in whiplash, limping, and difficulty in moving hind limbs), and killed and dissected them.Experimenters tied live pigs to a metal sled for eight hours without providing them with water or food, screwed a metal block into their pelvis, inserted electrodes into their abdomen, slammed them into a wall—which caused multiple fractures and severe injuries to the animals’ spine, pelvis, and internal organs—and killed and dissected them.Experimenters starved pigs for 24 hours, deprived them of water for six hours, strapped them into a car seat with seat belts and ropes, slammed them into a wall—which caused them to sustain severe fractures, contusions, and lacerations. caused bleeding of their internal organs. and resulted in immediate death for half the animals used—and then dissected them.International Journal of Crashworthiness Live pigs used in horrendous crash tests conducted by China’s Institute for Traffic Medicine are slammed into walls, causing these intelligent animals to suffer severe injuries. Similar tests were ended by General Motors in 1993 after 18 months of a hard-hitting PETA campaign in which we pointed out both the cruelty and the scientific invalidity of such tests.Photo: © 2018 Sishu Guan et al.A live, sensitive, and intelligent pig at China’s Third Military Medical University (now known as the Army Medical University and affiliated with Daping Hospital) is barbarically tied down on a metal board and slammed into a solid wall in a poor attempt to mimic human injuries in a car crash.Photo: © 2018 Sishu Guan et al.Shocking time-lapse photos from China’s Research Institute for Traffic Medicine show a live pig crudely tied down to a metal board and slammed into a solid wall, leading to extreme compression of the animal’s body, multiple fractures, and injuries to the spine, pelvis, and multiple internal organs.Using sentient animals in car-crash tests is cruel, archaic, and unjustifiable. Pigs and dogs are fundamentally anatomically different from humans. Car companies figured out years ago that these kind of experiments are worthless and tell us nothing about a human experience in a car crash.These days, companies use advanced technology—such as clinical human studies, advanced computer modeling, 3-D medical imaging, and sophisticated manikins—for their car-crash research. Other researchers have also used human cadavers and virtual reality (digital crash dummies) for the same purpose. In the 21st century, every car company on the planet should already have adopted these methods.Help PETA Prevent Dogs and Other Animals From Being Used in Lethal ExperimentsPETA continues to work to end these abhorrent car-crash tests on dogs and pigs. When it comes to feeling joy, cherishing life, and experiencing pain, other animals are just like us.So imagine the hellish reality that millions of animals experience every day inside laboratories.

Weapons exports are a long-running political issue in Switzerland. The Yemen conflict has now rekindled the debate and presented the Federal Council with a challenge. A look at the current state of affairs.
Saudi Arabia announced “Operation Decisive Storm” on 25 March 2015. Air attacks on Yemen aimed to bring the Shiite Houthi rebels to their knees and return to power the government under President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi which had been driven out. On the same day the first bombs hit the Yemeni capital of Sana’a.
The start of the military intervention in Yemen – a desperately poor country in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula – had direct implications for the Swiss weapons industry. In consultation with the Federal Council, two days later the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) blocked all pending applications for the export of war material to states in the Saudi-led military coalition. In addition to Saudi Arabia, the effective moratorium on exports also included Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Over a year later, on 20 April 2016, the moratorium was lifted despite the war in Yemen continuing to rage on to the present day. On that same date, the Federal Council dealt with over 50 expired export applications from Swiss companies while the Yemen conflict was going on and finally approved exports worth a total of CHF 185 million after a month of wrangling between the two Free Democrat Federal Councillors Johann Schneider-Ammann and Didier Burkhalter. The great majority of items were spare parts and components for air defence systems sent to Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. However, the Federal Council also gave the go-ahead for the export of “replacement parts and components for F-5 fighter jets” to Bahrain as well as “replacement parts for M109 tank howitzers” to the UAE. “Misuse to commit violations of international humanitarian law and serious violations of human rights,” wrote the Federal Council, could be “largely” ruled out in the case of such war material.
This decision did not concern the fundamental question of yes or no to weapons exports. This had previously been taken by the Swiss electorate in November 2009 when the popular initiative “for a ban on the export of war material” put forward by a left-wing alliance was overwhelmingly rejected with 68.2 % of voters opposed. It was instead much more about the interpretation of the applicable legal provisions on the export of war material. The case is nevertheless a good example of the complex sphere of conflicting interests in which weapons exports have always found themselves – namely between economic and security policy arguments, on the one hand, and international law and the neutrality and humanitarian principles of Swiss foreign policy, on the other.
The economic importance of weapons exports
These aspects are also covered by the first article of the War Material Act. The act aims “to fulfil Switzerland’s international obligations and the respect of its foreign policy principles by means of controlling the manufacture and transfer of war material and related technology, while at the same time maintaining an industrial capacity in Switzerland that is adapted to the requirements of its national defence”. It should be noted that this act covers only war material in the narrow sense, such as weapons, munitions and defence equipment items “that are designed or modified specifically for use in war or armed combat”, according to SECO. War material is therefore differentiated from “special military goods”, such as training aircraft and reconnaissance drones as well as so-called “dual-use goods”, which cover tooling machines, for example, that can be used for both civil and military purposes.
It is difficult to quantify the economic importance of the Swiss weapons industry precisely as it is not listed separately in statistics. The figures available nevertheless show that it is a comparatively small sector in the Swiss economy. The Swiss ASD division, created with the merger of aeronautics, security and defence within the umbrella organisation Swissmem, indicates a total of around 10,000 employees at 50 companies. It can therefore be very important locally. Mowag in Kreuzlingen, for example, which is renowned for its armoured vehicles such as the Piranha, employs around 650 people and is therefore the largest employer in the small town on Lake Constance. The company belongs to the US group General Dynamics. Other large corporations include Ruag, which is wholly owned by the Swiss Confederation, and Rheinmetall Air Defence, which emerged from Oerlikon-Contraves and is under German ownership.
The proportion of weapons exports in relation to total Swiss exports can nevertheless be calculated. War material worth CHF 447 million was exported in 2015, which makes up just 0.22 % of all exports. Even in 2011, when weapons exports amounted to CHF 873 million, they accounted for just 0.44 % of all exports.
An army requirement
The fact that war material exports in 2015 fell by around 20 % compared with the previous year had nothing to do with the moratorium on exports to the Middle East. SECO confirmed that this was not yet reflected in the figures. In terms of value, the approval of export applications increased by 35 % last year – despite the moratorium – which points to a recent upturn in future weapons exports. The moratorium nevertheless caused significant anxiety in the weapons industry, particularly since it was already suffering as a result of the strength of the Swiss franc and a decline in exports to European countries for years whereas the Middle East is one of its most important growth markets.
Business leaders and a lobby organisation known as the ‘working group for security and defence technology’, to which over 30 conservative MPs belong, put increasing pressure on the Federal Council to relax the policy on exports to Middle Eastern states again. In February, they complained in an open letter to the Federal Council, pointing out that around half of jobs in the weapons industry depend directly upon exports. They warned of job losses and the possible closure of entire plants and reminded it of the “security policy-motivated mandate set out in the War Material Act to maintain an industrial capacity in Switzerland that is adapted to the requirements of its national defence”.
They found Schneider-Ammann, Minister for Economic Affairs, a receptive listener. However, the approval of applications does not just require the authorisation of SECO but also that of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) led by FDP Federal Councillor Didier Burkhalter. In this particular instance, the FDFA insisted on the ban on exports to states “involved” in the Yemen conflict.
A restrictive approval policy
It referred to the War Material Ordinance. This establishes the basis for a relatively restrictive approval policy in comparison with other European states, such as Germany and France, despite Parliament lowering the threshold again two years ago. The criteria for the approval of export applications reflect the humanitarian principles of Swiss foreign policy but they should also minimise the risk of Switzerland’s reputation being damaged owing to the prohibited deployment of Swiss war material. This does not always succeed. In 2008, Chad violated SECO’s stipulations by using a Pilatus aircraft, which was only intended for training purposes, in combat missions against Sudan. In 2011, it became public that Saudi Arabia had used Mowag armoured personnel carriers to suppress protests by the people in Bahrain.
The ordinance specifically stipulates that when issuing export licences “maintaining peace, international security and regional stability” must be taken into account but also respect for human rights within the destination country as well as adherence to international law. Since 2008 the ordinance has also listed explicit grounds for exclusion. For example, authorisation must be refused if the destination country “commits systematic and serious violations of human rights” – unless there is “a small risk of the exported war material being used to commit serious human rights violations”. Approval may not be granted either if the destination country is involved in an internal or international armed conflict.
Wrangling in the Federal Council
These grounds for exclusion were also invoked by the FDFA in relation to the Yemen conflict. In view of the fact that the war in Yemen is still raging on, it saw no reason to lift the moratorium on exports. Schneider-Ammann’s department, meanwhile, took the view that the ordinance should be interpreted differently – only exports to Yemen itself were explicitly prohibited, especially since any other interpretation would also rule out the export of weapons to nations involved in war, such as the USA or Germany. As the two departments failed to reach agreement, the entire Federal Council eventually had to make a decision. Contrary to Schneider-Ammann’s assumptions, his request for approval of the blocked applications did not immediately receive majority support here either. In addition to Burkhalter, the two SP Federal Council members proved awkward and the CVP Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard was hesitant.
It required the mediation skills of Federal Chancellor Walter Thurnherr for the Federal Council to reach a decision at the third attempt approving most of the blocked applications as mentioned at the beginning. However, it rejected those export applications “where there was suitability for use, and an increased risk of use, in the Yemen conflict”. This concerned small weapons, their ammunition and 25,000 hand grenades. Contrary to Schneider-Ammann’s request, the Federal Council also rejected the export of a Piranha armoured personnel carrier to Qatar. Mowag had wanted to supply this for test purposes and, according to information from the NZZ, was hoping to secure a subsequent order for the export of 400 Piranhas worth billions.
The issue remains on the agenda
While the weapons industry breathed a sigh of relief after the Federal Council’s decision, politicians on the left and organisations such as the Group for Switzerland without an Army were outraged. Motions from the SP and Greens calling for a renewed halt to war material exports to Middle Eastern states are currently pending in Parliament. The demand is also being supported by EVP, CVP and BDP politicians as well as the Green Liberals. This political issue will continue to run and not just because of the critics of weapons exports. The weapons industry also remains unhappy and continues to complain about not having a level playing field with its European competitors. Mowag CEO Oliver Dürr is annoyed that Germany could supply vehicles to Qatar for demonstration purposes whereas the Federal Council denied his company an export licence, as he told the “Neue Zürcher Zeitung” in September.
The humanitarian situation in Yemen has since further deteriorated over recent months and the number of civilian victims is growing. According to the UN, in August at least 10 children were killed in an air attack on a school by the Saudi-led military coalition while 19 people lost their lives in an attack on a hospital. At the beginning of October, over 140 people died in the capital of Sana’a in a suspected Saudi air attack on a funeral and hundreds more were injured. The conflict had claimed over 10,000 lives by the end of August.
The view of Chantal Galladé, SP National Councillor for the canton of Zurich, member of the National Council’s Security Policy Committee:
“Without security there is no quality of life. Security is the result of a society that supports freedom for everyone – and of a functioning constitutional state and good governance. This also includes the capability of the legitimate state authority to ensure the protection of the civilian population with (armed) force within the limits of human rights. Supplying weapons to those who guarantee that they will only be used for the protection of the civilian population and will adhere to human rights is legitimate. Swiss legislation is also based on such considerations. The War Material Ordinance categorically prohibits transactions if the destination country is involved in an internal or international armed conflict or if the destination country violates human rights systematically and seriously. This makes all the more intolerable the Federal Council’s decision of 20 April 2016 – which is erroneous on moral, political and legal grounds – not to stop the ongoing export of war material to the war alliance which has caused a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Yemen and to even authorise new weapons exports to these warring states based on dubious grounds. Blood-stained deals are unworthy of humanitarian Switzerland and are unacceptable.”
The view of Corina Eichenberger, FDP National Councillor for the canton of Aargau, co-chair of the Security and Defence Technology Working Group, chair of the National Council’s Security Policy Committee:
“The Swiss security and defence technology industry is a cornerstone of Swiss security policy. Our nation has a strategic interest in a modern weapons industry to ensure it is not completely reliant upon defence technology imports. In order for the security industry to perform its mandate in the interests of national defence, it is dependent upon both orders from the Swiss army and export opportunities. The Swiss people voted against banning war material exports in 1972, 1997 and most recently in 2009. We are aware that weapons are no ordinary products – they can kill but also protect. The export of arms is subject to rigorous legal provisions in Switzerland. The Federal Council recently evaluated export applications for the Middle East on a country and material-specific basis. The lack of scope for differentiation concerning the internal conflicts criterion in export policy is problematic, which effectively restricts exports to the Middle East to the extent that the industry is greatly disadvantaged compared with its European competitors. Exporting goods of a defensive nature and which cannot be used against the civilian population is right.”"ÿÿSwiss weapons exports – an explosive business

Citing “scientific judgment” and the need for “the development of safe and effective treatments,” Sage Therapeutics has ended its use of the forced swim test.© iStock.com/bbossomPETA scientists originally approached Sage Therapeutics after learning that between 2016 and 2018, some of its employees had coauthored at least two papers describing the use of the forced swim test in experiments involving 51 rats and 60 mice. In these abusive and pointless tests, experimenters drop small animals—including mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils—into containers of water and watch while the panicked animals struggle to escape. The test was developed in the 1970s, purportedly to study the effectiveness of antidepressant medication, but it’s been widely discredited by scientists.Sage Therapeutics is the eighth pharmaceutical company to have banned the forced swim test after working with PETA, following industry giants including Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie Inc., Roche, AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk A/S, and Boehringer Ingelheim.If Sage Therapeutics, a company specializing in antidepressant drugs­, has banned this useless test, other pharma companies have zero justification for not following suit.

Published October 25, 2011 by . Last Updated October 14, 2013. In the first case of its kind, PETA, three marine-mammal experts, and two former orca trainers are filing a lawsuit asking a federal court to declare that five wild-caught orcas forced to perform at SeaWorld are being held as slaves in violation of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The filing—the first ever seeking to apply the 13th Amendment to nonhuman animals—names the five orcas as plaintiffs and also seeks their release to their natural habitats or seaside sanctuaries.The suit is based on the plain text of the 13th Amendment, which prohibits the condition of slavery without reference to “person” or any particular class of victim. “Slavery is slavery, and it does not depend on the species of the slave any more than it depends on gender, race, or religion,” says general counsel to PETA, Jeffrey Kerr.The five wild-captured orca plaintiffs are Tilikum and Katina (both confined at SeaWorld Orlando) and Kasatka, Corky, and Ulises (all three confined at SeaWorld San Diego).“All five of these orcas were violently seized from the ocean and taken from their families as babies. They are denied freedom and everything else that is natural and important to them while kept in small concrete tanks and reduced to performing stupid tricks,” says PETA President Ingrid E. Newkirk. “The 13th Amendment prohibits slavery, and these orcas are, by definition, slaves.”In the aerial view of SeaWorld, one can see how little room orcas have. Inside the circle is Tilikum, whose nose and tail almost touch the ends of his tank. Image © 2011 GoogleOrcas are intelligent animals who, in the wild, work cooperatively, form complex relationships, communicate using distinct dialects, and swim up to 100 miles every day. At SeaWorld, they are forced to swim in circles in small, barren concrete tanks. Deprived of the opportunity to make conscious choices and to practice their cultural vocal, social, and foraging traditions, they are compelled to perform meaningless tricks for a reward of dead fish.Our understanding of animals grows every day. Animals are no longer regarded as “things” to dominate, but as breathing, feeling beings with families, dialects, intellect, and emotions. Just as we look back with shame at a time when we enslaved other humans and viewed some people as property less deserving of protection and consideration, we will look back on our treatment of these animals with shame. The 13th Amendment exists to abolish slavery in all its forms—and this lawsuit is the next step.The orcas are represented in the suit by what the law refers to as their “next friends”: PETA, Ric O’Barry (a former orca and dolphin trainer and the star of the Academy Award–winning documentary The Cove), renowned marine biologist and orca expert Dr. Ingrid N.

When the 2013 film “Blackfish” highlighted the story of Tilikum, a captive orca that killed a trainer, it spurred widespread anger over the confinement of the whales by companies like SeaWorld.
There were months of news articles. Angry musicians refused to perform for SeaWorld’s parks. Attendance dipped.
It was all part of what regulators are calling “the Blackfish effect” — a spiraling crisis that threatened SeaWorld’s reputation, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Privately, SeaWorld officials were deeply concerned. But in public, for months after the documentary was released, the company denied or played down “the Blackfish effect,” regulators said. The law requires publicly traded companies to inform investors of circumstances that could materially affect their business.
This week, the S.E.C. announced that SeaWorld Entertainment and its former C.E.O. have agreed to pay $5 million in fines “to settle fraud charges for misleading investors about the impact the documentary film Blackfish had on the company’s reputation and business,” according to an agency statement.
SeaWorld has neither admitted nor denied the allegations. In a statement Wednesday, the company said it was happy to have ""resolved this matter and to continue to focus on delivering superior guest experiences, world-class animal care and rescuing animals in need.”
The S.E.C. declined to comment beyond the statement and its court filings. In 2017, the company revealed that the United States Justice Department was criminally investigating statements by SeaWorld and some of its executives about the impact of “Blackfish.”
The Justice Department declined to comment Wednesday. A SeaWorld spokesman did not respond to questions about that investigation.
The news of S.E.C.’s settlement, which would still need to be approved by a federal judge, comes as a debate continues about the captivity of the highly social, highly intelligent whales. Once showcase performers at marine parks, they now are a source of perpetual criticism.
“Blackfish,” directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, focuses on the killing of a trainer, Dawn Brancheau, by Tilikum in Orlando, Fla., in 2010. “Blackfish” looked at the mental state of whales taken from their pods in the wild and raised at marine parks.
SeaWorld responded with a public-relations campaign, including a letter to movie critics that said “Blackfish” was misleading and agenda driven.
In 2016, SeaWorld said it would phase out orca performances and stop breeding the animals. Tilikum died last year. SeaWorld now has 21 whales at parks in Orlando, San Diego and San Antonio, Travis Claytor, a spokesman, said. He said the animals have lived in human care for most of their lives.
“The best place for these killer whales is to be with our dedicated and world-renowned animal care specialists, who have and will continue to provide each of them with the world’s best possible care,” Mr. Claytor said.
In its complaint against SeaWorld, the S.E.C. said the company was already concerned about the impact “Blackfish” would have on its business even before the documentary was released. After it was released, attendance dropped, but SeaWorld told reporters that it could “attribute no attendance impact at all to the movie,” according to the complaint.
SeaWorld stock prices dipped with negative publicity, the S.E.C. said.
A study of SeaWorld’s reputation showed that 32 percent of people who were aware of “Blackfish” had lower opinions of SeaWorld, even if they had not seen the movie, the S.E.C. said.
But at a strategy meeting about SeaWorld’s reputation, the company excluded the results of the study, the regulators said.
“As a result, SeaWorld’s then chairman of the board never saw the study and was not aware of its results,” the S.E.C.’s complaint said.
After “Blackfish” aired on TV at the end of 2013, a member of SeaWorld’s communications department called the company’s reputation “positively radioactive.”
SeaWorld also found attendance down 13 percent at the beginning of 2014 from the year before. One executive called the situation “grave.” But the company did not attribute that decline to the movie until August of that year.
In private, James Atchison, the former C.E.O., said the negative trend around the company’s orca program “will not diminish anytime soon, as the film will likely gain an Oscar nomination when they are announced in mid-January,” according to the S.E.C.
But in speaking to news reporters, Mr. Atchison said he could not connect the attention “Blackfish” was getting to any negative impact on the business.
As it turned out, Blackfish did not gain an Oscar nomination, to the delight of SeaWorld investors.
When the company finally acknowledged the “Blackfish effect” months later in a filing, the company’s stock price fell nearly 33 percent, from $28.15 to $18.90 per share. SeaWorld Entertainment closed Wednesday at $30.59 per share.

When we think about what contributes to microplastics in our waterways, plastic bags and single-use packaging come to mind. However, there is another product often overlooked: contact lenses. 

Americans use more than 3 billion contact lenses a year. Of those, 45,000 pounds of them end up in our waterways as one out of five Americans flushes them down the toilet – and even more end up in landfills. Both water treatment plants and standard recycling systems cannot process the contact lenses due to their size and malleability, as explained last year in The New York Times. 

The good news is that there is a more sustainable option—as in the One by One Recycling Program, in which consumers here in the U.S. can responsibly dispose their contact lenses and packaging such as blister packs and top foils.  

The One by One Recycling Program offers more than 4,000 drop-off locations across the United States for consumers to dispose of their used contact lenses and packaging. The program was born from a partnership between TerraCycle, the U.S. recycling and upcycling company that has long repurposed hard-to-recycle post-consumer waste, and Bausch + Lomb, the 166-year-old eye health products company.

One by One, more contact lenses are ending up in recycled products 

Once the consumer disposes his or her lenses and associated packaging in a recycling bin at a participating location, the waste is sent back to TerraCycle. From there, the contact lenses are separated from the blister packs. Then, the contact lenses and plastic components of the blister packs are melted and made into recycled products. the metal layers are recycled separately, according to Terracycle. 

Most recently, the One by One Recycling Program contributed to the manufacturing of training materials, including benches, tables and agility ramps, which in turn are donated to the Guide Dog Foundation, a nonprofit that trains guide dogs for the blind and visually impaired.  

“Before the One by One Recycling Program, contact lenses were one of the forgotten waste streams that were often overlooked due to their size,"" said Tom Szaky, CEO and founder of TerraCycle, in an interview earlier this month with Invision Magazine. “Together, we are helping to preserve our environment and transitioning these materials back into the world in a positive way – it’s a win-win for all.”

Since its inception in 2016, the companies behind the One by One Recycling Program said they have collected 16 million used contact lenses, blister packs and top foils. In an interview with TriplePundit, Bausch Health Companies’ Kristy Marks explained that the program’s leaders plan to scale the number of U.S. drop-off locations through exploring partnerships with retailers outside of the eye-care industry as well as growing the number of participating eye-care professionals.

Consumers are showing more interest in recycling used contacts

Additional companies are launching their own contact lens recycling programs. Johnson & Johnson has launched a recycling program for its branded contacts in the United Kingdom through a different partnership with Terracycle, while CooperVision is testing a similar program in Sweden.

As the daily disposable contact lens market share continues to grow at 9 percent annually—the fastest-growing segment of contact lenses—more consumers are showing an interest in recycling their contact lenses. For example, one study found that 77 percent of British contact lens wearers would recycle their contact lenses if they could.

“Patients are pleased to hear about it during their appointments, especially those who wear daily disposable lenses and have expressed concern about the added waste they create,” said Gina Wesley, O.D., from Complete Eye Care, Medina, MN, in a public statement. “I applaud Bausch + Lomb for leading the way in providing this solution for my practice and patients and helping to minimize the waste these materials generate.""

Law firm Hagen Berman previously represented private consumers Elaine McCoy (against Nestlé USA), Laura Dana (against Hershey) and Robert Hodson (versus Mars) in lawsuits intiated in September 2015. The suits alleged companies had failed to disclose cocoa in some chocolate brands may come from slave labor. A district court in California threw out the suits in 2016. The judge said it was not “sound policy” to compel manufacturers to disclose certain facts on packaging. “There are countless issues that may be legitimately important to many customers, and the courts are not suited to determine which should occupy the limited surface area of a chocolate wrapper,” he said.

“Like Nestle, Mars and Hershey’s have failed to take action on this issue, despite clear knowledge of their support of the use of child and slave labor, and have also failed to inform consumers at point-of-sale that their purchases are supporting this supply chain linked directly to atrocious human rights violations,” said Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman.
The suits allege Mars and Hershey have violated the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, which states “unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful”.
Mars: ‘Progress has been far too slow’
A Mars Wrigley Confectionery US spokesperson told ConfectioneryNews: “While we don’t comment on pending litigation, we believe that the worst forms of child labor have no place in the future of sustainable cocoa.”
They said child labor continues to be a challenge in West Africa’s cocoa sector.
“Mars has been working to address this challenge both on our own and through collaboration across sectors for years, and yet our view is that progress has been far too slow.""
The lawsuits against Mars and Hershey allege the chocolate industry repeatedly broke promises made in 2005 in the Harkin-Engel Protocol to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in Côte d’Ivoire by 2005.
The deadline was postponed to 2008, to 2010, and now to 2020, according to the complaint.
Mars’ spokesperson said: “While this is a complex issue with numerous drivers, we believe it can and must be addressed. We must identify and activate new and innovative strategies, partnerships and programs as we work across government, industry and civil society to make progress.”
Hershey points to certified volumes
Jeff Beckman, director of corporate communications at Hershey, said the Reese’s maker stood by its earlier comments to ConfectioneryNews.
“We are now sourcing more than 75% of our cocoa for our products around the world from certified and sustainable sources verified by independent authorities and will be at 100% by 2020.
“Certification includes strict regulations for cocoa farms, including prohibiting illegal and forced child labor in accordance with International Labour Organization conventions,” he told us earlier this month.

HEALTH-CONSCIOUS parents have taken aim at Kellogg's for what they say is dishonest advertising of sugar-laden cereal.
Kellogg's Nutri-Grain cereal, marketed as an energy-packed breakfast for boys training as ironmen, has been named the most shady advertising campaign by The Parents' Jury. McDonald's use of cricket legend Shane Warne to push its chicken pieces and the Kellogg's 4D Choc Bar ad also came under fire from the jury of 5000 parents and grandparents.

''The industry may be getting smarter about getting around its self-regulatory code, but parents tell us they are fed up with unhealthy food advertisements being shown during their kids' favourite [TV] programs,'' Ms Langelaan said.

Leading cereal maker Kellogg Company has agreed to new advertising restrictions to resolve a Federal Trade Commission investigation into questionable immunity-related claims for Rice Krispies cereal. This is the second time in the last year that the FTC has taken action against the company.
“We expect more from a great American company than making dubious claims – not once, but twice – that its cereals improve children’s health,” said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz. “Next time, Kellogg needs to stop and think twice about the claims it’s making before rolling out a new ad campaign, so parents can make the best choices for their children.”
Kellogg has agreed to expand a settlement order that was reached last year after the FTC alleged that the company made false claims that its Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal was “clinically shown to improve kids’ attentiveness by nearly 20%.”
At about the same time that Kellogg agreed to stop making these kinds of false claims in its cereal ads, the company began a new advertising campaign promoting the purported health benefits of Rice Krispies, according to the FTC. On product packaging, Kellogg claimed that Rice Krispies cereal “now helps support your child’s immunity,” with “25 percent Daily Value of Antioxidants and Nutrients – Vitamins A, B, C, and E.” The back of the cereal box stated that “Kellogg’s Rice Krispies has been improved to include antioxidants and nutrients that your family needs to help them stay healthy.”
Under the original settlement order covering Frosted Mini-Wheats, Kellogg was barred from making claims about the benefits to cognitive health, process, or function provided by any cereal or any morning food or snack food unless the claims were true and substantiated.
The expanded order against Kellogg prohibits the company from making claims about any health benefit of any food unless the claims are backed by scientific evidence and not misleading.
The Commission vote to modify the 2009 settlement order was 5-0, with Commissioner Julie Brill and Chairman Jon Leibowitz issuing a separate joint concurring statement. “As a trusted, long-established company with a presence in millions of American homes, Kellogg must not shirk its responsibility to do the right thing when it advertises the food we feed our children,” they wrote in the statement, which can be found on the FTC’s website and as a link to this press release at: http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0823145/100602kelloggstatement.pdf.

There’s a reminder carved in tiny lettering on the rubber sole of a pair of white sneakers from the new brand Thousand Fell: “Please return for recycling.” The brand is the first to launch a model where it takes back its shoes to be recycled in their entirety, paying for customers to ship back old pairs, so the company can assure that they are taken apart and every component is recycled or composted.Stuart Ahlum and Chloe Songer [Photo: Thousand Fell]The founders, who both worked in the apparel industry, found that consumers in their twenties tend to replace white sneakers—maybe the most popular basic shoe—every four to six months. “They’re really frequently used, and if they’re worn through even slightly when they’re donated for a second life, they go straight to landfill,” says Thousand Fell cofounder Chloe Songer, who previously worked at Gap. Once in a landfill, leather and rubber leach chemicals and take decades to break down. plastic can take centuries. “Is it okay to stamp your logo on something and then have it sitting in a landfill for 1,000 years, for eight to 10 generations?” she says. “I don’t think so.” The founders saw an opportunity to design a better system.Songer and cofounder Stuart Ahlum, who was working in China for another shoe brand when the two met, spent two years sourcing materials that were as sustainable as possible. The first two styles available are classic slip-on and lace-up sneakers. The upper is made from recycled plastic bottles with a corn coating that makes it look like leather. the sole is made from the same carbon-neutral rubber that Patagonia uses to make wetsuits. The insole is made from recycled yoga mat material, with a mesh liner made from aloe vera.Working closely with recyclers, the team designed the unisex shoes to be easy to disassemble, to allow the materials a second life. The outsole, for example, is attached with water-based glues so it can easily be removed at the recycling facility. Some of the components can be recycled into new shoes, while others will be composted or recycled separately. The designers are now exploring ways to go further, designing the next iteration to use even fewer stitches and adhesives.[Photo: Thousand Fell]“We’ve been able to cost-engineer this to make sure that it’s still affordable, and that we’re still running a healthy business,” says Ahlum. “But it has taken a lot more time and effort to develop into these products. Footwear is an old-school style of manufacturing. People want to just use traditional textiles and synthetics and plastics and leather.” The cost of making the shoe, unsurprisingly, is higher than for a typical sneaker, especially when the cost of taking back the shoe for recycling is included. But the company believes that there’s demand for a new way of making shoes and that it will be able to build brand loyalty.[Photo: Thousand Fell]The design is a different approach from what Adidas took with its Futurecraft Loop, a beta-test shoe made from a single material that can be ground up and made into a new shoe. “They grind the whole shoe down, and it’s very difficult to do,” Ahlum says. “And there’s a scale issue there because you have to change radically how a shoe is constructed.” Adidas, which plans to release its shoe to the public in 2021 after a limited release this year, also can’t fully recycle one shoe into another yet. the recycled material only makes up 10% of the next shoe.[Photo: Thousand Fell]Thousand Fell, which is continuing to explore new materials including lab-grown leather, sees end-of-life issues as the next step in sustainability for the industry. “We consider ‘sustainability 1.0’ to be what Everlane has really championed, with supply chain transparency—so who made your product, was it ethically sourced, where did it come from, what kind of materials are within the product?” Songer says. Next, she says, were innovations in materials such as Rothy’s washable, 3D-knitted shoes made from recycled bottles. The new frontier is the circular economy, and brands “being accountable or responsible for what happens to that product that they brought into the world when it’s over.”[Photo: Thousand Fell]The shoes are designed to be as durable as possible, and classic enough that they won’t go out of style. But when a pair wears out, a customer can use a prepaid shipping label to send them back to the company, which will work with a local recycler and industrial composting facility and give the customer a $20 credit toward their next pair. (If there’s life left in the shoes, the company will clean them and donate them.) The brand’s goal is to make it as simple as possible for customers. “We want to make it really easy and kind of an encouragement as a group or as a community to step up,” Songer says."ÿÿWhen you wear out these white shoes, you can send them back to be 100% recycled

 Published May 16, 2019 by .  Tyson’s chicken recall just keeps expanding. At last count, the company had recalled almost 12 million pounds of chicken flesh, the equivalent of more than 2 million birds’ lives, because it could contain metal fragments. So after everything these birds went through—being crammed into dark, ammonia-filled warehouses. bred to grow unnaturally large, unnaturally quickly. and having their throats slit—in a final act of injustice, their bodies were thrown out like trash. And Tyson will certainly kill more animals to replace them.In the early days of the recall, PETA reached out to Tyson, urging the company to do something to make amends for wasting so many animals’ lives—including by donating vegan food, such as Beyond Chicken Strips from Beyond Meat, to charities benefitting the homeless and malnourished. Tyson never responded.Produce must be recalled sometimes as well, of course, but when it’s animal flesh that’s being recalled, you can bet that more animals will suffer to make up for the company’s losses.On high-speed slaughter lines, birds are yanked out of crates, thrown upside down into shackles, and sent on a mechanized belt down the slaughter line. Their necks are slashed open, and many of them are still alive when they’re plunged headfirst into scalding-hot water to remove their feathers. Birds are exempt from the Humane Slaughter Act and have no federal legal protection.There is no need to support this abhorrent abuse of animals. With so many faux-chicken products readily available in every supermarket, humans can easily choose these and other vegan foods that look and taste the same as their animal-derived counterparts, are better for their own health and kinder to the environment, and that no animal had to suffer and die for.And the recall is one more reason why Tyson should hasten the transition to producing only plant-derived foods. There is a glimmer of hope: The company is planning to launch its own line of vegan meat products, which will be released as soon as this summer.If you’d like assistance with buying and preparing animal-friendly meals, PETA’s vegan mentors are ready to help.

11:22 CEST+02:00
The Swiss banking giant UBS goes on trial in Paris on Monday October 8th to face accusations it orchestrated a huge tax fraud scheme for wealthy French clients, with potential fines of billions of euros.
After a six-year investigation, judges last year charged the bank and its French subsidiary of laundering proceeds from tax fraud carried out from 2004 to 2012, allegations the bank has denied.
""UBS will finally have the chance to respond to what are usually unfounded claims,"" the bank has said, vowing to ""strongly defend itself.""
Six bank managers and former managers are also on trial, including Raoul Weil, the former third-in-command at UBS, and Patrick de Fayet, formerly the second-ranking executive for its French operations. The inquiry was opened after a former employee alerted authorities over the bank's alleged system of setting up dual bookkeeping to hide the movement of capital into Switzerland.
France's national financial crimes unit estimates at least €9.76 billion ($11.2 billion) was not reported to the French tax authorities. The bank's staff allegedly approached French clients, from wealthy businessmen to sports stars, at receptions, golf and tennis tournaments or concerts to convince them to hide their money in Switzerland. If convicted UBS could face fines of up to half the amount of money laundered, or nearly €five billion.
'My honour'
The whistleblower in the case, Nicolas Forissier, was sacked by UBS in 2009 for alleged ""gross misconduct"". ""My honour will finally be cleared,"" Forissier, a former internal auditing chief, said last year when judges ordered the trial after prosecutors and bank executives failed to reach a plea deal.

According to documents provided by German authorities to French investigators, deposits from some 38,000 French clients with UBS amounted to a total of around 13 billion Swiss francs (€11 billion, $13 billion), a source close to the case told AFP. Not all these clients are suspected of tax fraud, the source said.
UBS has faced similar accusations in other countries in recent years. In 2009 the bank was ordered by the US authorities to pay a $780 million fine for allegedly helping 20,000 wealthy clients hide some $20 billion from the Internal Revenue Service.

Belgium has also indicted the bank for organised tax fraud. France has cracked down hard on tax evasion in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, not least after a former budget minister was found to have hidden money in overseas accounts. A court upheld Jerome Cahuzac's fraud conviction this year, handing him a €300,000 fine and banning him from public office for five years.
The UBS trial is expected to run until mid-November, barring any procedural delays.

Top women bankers at UBS have criticised Switzerland’s biggest lender over its practice of using their maternity leave as a reason for imposing long-term cuts to their bonuses, raising questions over its commitment to gender equality.
Some have resigned in frustration — forgoing promotions in at least two cases — while others having begrudgingly continued working for less pay than before they became mothers, according to several current and former UBS employees.
One woman had her bonus reduced and re-based four times after having had four children. Another was informed that being a working mother was a “lifestyle choice” by means of explanation for her lower bonus, while someone else was told to “focus on her baby” when she challenged the policy.

“Basically once pregnant, one will never catch-up again with male colleagues in the career one has built up prior to going on maternity,” said one of the women, who still works for the bank. Despite multiple complaints, “the practice still continues, women still live through it exactly the same, nothing has changed in times where [UBS] is very proud of promoting what a great bank this is for women to work in”.
More than a dozen women in the Swiss wealth management unit have complained about the treatment they received when they took time off to have children, which in many cases resulted in their bonuses being cut 30% or more. Despite the bank pledging to address the issue more than a year ago, some women continue to be affected.
The practice in question meant UBS applied a reduction to the annual bonuses of those women who took the seven months of leave offered to new mothers, the people said. However, when the bankers returned their incentive pay was not restored to its former level, but rather re-based at the lowered amount. In many cases, three years or more later it had still not recovered.
The women affected span the higher ranks of the core wealth management unit in the lender’s home country. Executive directors, directors and associate directors have all formally complained about their treatment to their line managers, human resources and the head of diversity and inclusion, the people said. They have also formed a private group to share their experiences and lobby for change.
After being made aware of the problem last year, UBS’s global head of diversity and inclusion, Carolanne Minashi, promised a formal review of the bank’s post-maternity leave bonus policy and raised the issue with those in charge of the “global reward” team, according to documents seen by the FT.
While a bank spokesman said Ms Minashi took the issue seriously and had installed new safeguards since then, some women were still being affected, the people said.
“It is extremely important to us that employees with similar roles, performance and experience are rewarded equally and fairly,” UBS said. “We approach the issue of parental leave proactively and systematically during the reward process to determine whether there are gaps and to close those gaps if we find any.”
Stefan Seiler, its global head of HR, said any women who felt their pay had been inappropriately affected should get in touch with him directly to correct any mistakes. The spokesman added that the comments made by some managers about motherhood “were archaic and have no place anywhere in UBS culture”.
In Switzerland, UBS offers women six months maternity leave at full salary, with an optional seventh month of unpaid time off. That is more generous than the 14 weeks guaranteed under Swiss law, among the lowest of any country on the continent.
By contrast, new fathers are given two weeks off by UBS — with the option to take another four unpaid — and their bonuses are not reduced “pro-rata” to reflect this, according to two male staff who took paternity leave and still received their full bonus.
Additionally, some Swiss men take a few weeks leave every year for as long as a decade to fulfil their mandatory national military service and UBS did not reduce their bonuses in a similar way, the two male employees said.
UBS has been one of the more vocal banks about gender equality. Chairman Axel Weber has repeatedly called for more females in executive and leadership positions and set a goal that at least one-third of top management jobs should go to women.
However, there is only one woman on UBS’s 13-strong group executive board, while the supervisory board has four female directors and eight male ones.

A French court slammed UBS with $5 billion in fines and charges in a criminal trial over tax evasion and money-laundering. The Swiss bank vowed to put up a fight.
Zurich-based UBS was hit with a 3.7 billion euro ($4.2 billion) fine by a Paris judge in a long-running criminal proceeding over allegations of tax evasion and money-laundering, according to Swiss newswire «AWP» (in German). On top of the fine the bank will have to repay damages of 800 million euros to the French state, the court ruled.
The move is a massive setback for UBS, which almost immediately said it would appeal the ruling, as it had previously vowed to do in case of a defeat. «UBS will appeal the verdict and evaluate whether the written decision requires any additional steps», the bank said in a statement.
Five years ago, France ordered UBS to deposit 1.1 billion euros as a form of corporate bail after prosecutors said the bank systematically helped French citizens avoid paying taxes from 2004 to 2012. The two sides came close to finding a settlement, only for the deal to collapse at the last minute.
Scandal Series
UBS has stowed roughly $2.5 billion in total provisions to settle past scandals. Wednesday's fine marks the highest ever suffered by UBS, which has been ensnared in a series of scandals since the financial crisis including allegedly mis-selling mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008/09 crisis, rigging benchmark interest rates, and manipulating foreign exchange and precious metal markets.
The French ruling coincides with the tenth anniversary of UBS' biggest tax evasion fine until now: in February 2009, the Swiss bank paid $780 million to U.S. prosecutors to set aside an tax evasion and fraud probe. UBS later paid German officials 300 million to settle similar allegations. The bank has argued that the French investigation was politically motivated and subsequently stiffened its resolve to fight the claims."ÿÿUBS Hit With $5 Billion French Verdict

Viridor and Unilever have agreed a new contract which will see Unilever receive of a range of recycled plastic from Viridor’s £65m Avonmouth Resource Recovery Centre near Bristol.
The companies – both founding members of the UK Plastics Pact – have agreed an initial five-year contract for recycled plastic from the plant which is powered by non-recyclable waste through Viridor’s new £252m Avonmouth Energy Recovery Facility.
Viridor Resource Management Managing Director Keith Trower said: “Viridor and Unilever are committed to helping the UK achieve its recycling and sustainability targets and this contract demonstrates how we are translating that ambition in action. 
Crucially, this contract also recognises the relationship between UK Plastics Pact partners
“To do this in a meaningful way Viridor has acknowledged the UK plastic reprocessing capacity gap and our Avonmouth investment is our response to that market demand. By putting more recycled plastic back into the economy, and powering that process with non-recyclable waste, we are creating a sustainable solution and ensuring consumer brands, such as Unilever, have access to quality post-consumer recycled material.”
Mr Trower added: “Crucially, this contract also recognises the relationship between UK Plastics Pact partners and how such collaboration is vital if we are to achieve closed loop recycling solutions and achieve the Pact’s goals of 30% average recycled content across all plastic packaging by 2025.”
Collaboration
Sebastian Munden, Unilever UK & Ireland General Manager, said: “Unilever has committed to increase its use of recycled plastic and close the loop on plastic packaging.
He said: “Limited availability of high-quality recycled content has, though, remained a challenge and that’s why we’re so pleased that our collaboration with Viridor will bring extra capacity on-line in the UK.  This will be essential towards creating a more circular market, as well as contributing to the UK Plastic Pact targets.
“We think that UK citizens will also be encouraged to recycle more if they can see their efforts being rewarded with more plastic going back into new bottles and not ending up in the environment.”
Viridor MD Phil Piddington said the Avonmouth plant was a crucial part of the company’s circular economy commitments and an important next step in its plastic recycling strategy.
Reprocessed plastic uses 50% less electricity than virgin plastic, which is already a very persuasive argument in favour of recycled materials
He said: “The unique design of the site – incorporating sophisticated energy recovery and recycling technology –  allows for the transfer of power and heat to serve the recycling and reprocessing site, creating a truly resource and energy-efficient waste management solution.
“Reprocessed plastic uses 50% less electricity than virgin plastic, which is already a very persuasive argument in favour of recycled materials. When we reduce our energy consumption further by tapping in to the low carbon power created through energy recovery, we can achieve even greater sustainability and environmental efficiency.”
Viridor and Unilever have previously worked together with Nextek Ltd on detectable black plastic packaging for Unilever’s TRESemmé and Lynx personal care brands with trials carried out at Viridor’s Rochester Polymers Recycling Facility in Kent.
In year one, the UK’s biggest multi-polymer plant at Avonmouth will produce 60KTPA of high quality recycled plastic a year from 81KTPA feedstock, rising to 89KTPA in year three, producing 63KTPA of recycled material.  
The Viridor project will put 60,000 tonnes of recycled plastic from bottles, pots, tubs and trays in PET, HDPE and PP flake and pellet form) back in the economy every year as a viable and sustainable solution to virgin plastic. It will be powered by diverting 320,000 tonnes of waste from landfill and generating 282GWh of electricity – the equivalent energy used to power around 77,000 homes."ÿÿViridor and Unilever agree five-year recycled plastic contract

The 44 workers of Wintek in Suzhou, China, are alleging they were poisoned by n-hexane, a chemical that can cause damage to the peripheral nervous system and the spinal cord, according to Stratfor, a global intelligence agency.
Stratfor's report said that since August 2009, 62 Wintek workers have been hospitalized due to n-hexane poisoning.
Wintek, which makes LCD and touch panels for consumer devices, began using n-hexane instead of alcohol sometime last year to clean screens, because apparently it dried more quickly and reduced streaks. Stratfor notes that the manager who decided to use n-hexane has since been fired.
The Guardian reported that after the chemical switch, workers immediately noticed the pungent smell of n-hexane but did not know it would affect their health.
""We hadn't even heard of occupational illnesses before,"" Wintek worker Xiao Ling said in an interview with The Guardian.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Wintek.
Apple works with several Asian suppliers who provide components for its iPhones, iPads, iPods and Macs. The company earlier this year published its supplier responsibility report, describing the company's efforts to ensure its partners around the world comply with responsible business practices.
In its report (.pdf), Apple said it audited 102 facilities in 2009, up from only 39 just two years ago. The company also claimed it trained 133,000 supervisors and workers on workers' rights and management responsibility.
Global Post ran an extensive report late last year detailing the labor violations committed at supply chains all over Asia. The report based its findings on six months of interviews with workers and activists. Some claimed they worked in sweatshop-like conditions, such as hourly wages below a dollar and firings with no notice.

Zara, with more than 2,200 stores worldwide, might be one of the world’s most successful fast-fashion companies, but it does not make its cash with clean hands. The Associated Press reports today that shoppers in Istanbul are finding unexpected tags inside Zara merchandise proclaiming, “I made this item you are going to buy, but I didn’t get paid for it.”
Turkish workers employed by third-party manufacturer Bravo say they’re owed three months’ pay after the company shut down overnight. They are walking into stores to manually attach these tags, hoping that customers who read their notes will help convince Zara, which did not respond to the AP, to pay them.
While nothing ever seems to impact its bottom line — Amancio Ortega, the owner of parent company Inditex, is the world’s richest man — Zara is consistently taken to task for causing colossal environmental damage, ripping off various fashion designers, and turning a blind eye to dismal factory conditions. The Spanish chain has been sued for poor working conditions and accused of both slave and child labor, as well as exploiting Syrian refugees as young as 15. there was also that one time a dead rat was found sewn into a seam of a dress bought in a Connecticut store. As labor and human rights site Equal Times writes, “Zara is a company that would rather pay fines than rectify its bad labor practices.”
Zara has previously promised to look into incidents without necessarily claiming responsibility for the actions of its third-party factories. This response isn’t unique to the fast-fashion retailer. it’s a defense regulary brands use to shirk liability. Why the company still won’t fix a corrupt system it pioneered is inexcusable. If small startups like Everlane can successfully navigate running a fashion brand with ethical work conditions and fair labor wages, surely a giant company like Inditex, which brings in about $27 billion annually, can figure it out."ÿÿUnpaid Laborers Are Slipping Tags Into Zara Clothes
9005ÿ19/11/2019ÿ6ÿTestÿ3ÿEnvironmentÿ2ÿpositiveÿÿÿÿÿhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/14/norwegian-wealth-fund-blacklists-g4s-shares-over-human-rights-concernsÿNorwayï¿½s sovereign wealth fund has banned all holdings of shares in G4S because of the risk of human rights violations against the British security companyï¿½s workforce in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Norwayï¿½s Council of Ethics, which monitors investments in the countryï¿½s ï¿½860bn Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), said there was an ï¿½unacceptable risk of the company contributing to systematic human rights violationsï¿½. Up to 30,000 staff could be affected.  The council said it had not officially considered whether G4S had used forced labour ï¿½ a form of modern slavery ï¿½ but it said ï¿½the companyï¿½s practice ï¿½ in the worse cases ï¿½ could place workers under constraintï¿½.  At the end of 2018, the GPFG owned 2.33% of G4Sï¿½s shares, worth about 784m Norwegian krone (ï¿½66m), but it has since sold most of them.  G4S, which is listed on the FTSE 250, provides security services in more than 90 countries. The Council of Ethics focused on its ï¿½extensive useï¿½ of migrant workers from India, Pakistan and Nepal across the Middle East.  G4S is one of the worldï¿½s largest private employers, with 570,000 staff in 90 countries. It earns about a fifth of its revenues from governments. In September G4S said it would leave the immigration sector after a scandal at a centre near Londonï¿½s Gatwick airport, and it has been fined millions of pounds in recent years over failings in UK asylum services.  The council said the company was aware of the issues after compiling its own internal audits but had not done enough to stop alleged abuses. It said many of G4Sï¿½s 18,000 migrant workers in Qatar and the Emirates could be affected, as well as another 11,100 people employed in Saudi Arabia, which has a similarly restrictive labour practices.  The wealth fund said many workers had their passports taken from them and were paid less than agreed. Interviews with G4S workers found that some had to take out loans in order to pay fees of as much as $1,800 (ï¿½1,400) to get their jobs, and were then paid salaries between $130 and $170. They were often unable to quit as a result of ï¿½debt bondageï¿½. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  The council said its investigations showed ï¿½that workers have paid recruitment fees to work for the company, and that workers have taken out loans in their home country to be able to pay the fees. When the workers arrive in the Gulf, they must spend a significant part of their salary to pay off this debt, and therefore have little chance of leaving.  ï¿½Many also received far lower wages than agreed, and in the Emirates, the workers got their passport confiscated. The councilï¿½s investigations also revealed long working days, a lack of overtime payment and examples of harassment.ï¿½ This harassment was said to include threats to dock wages, threats of dismissal or even deportation.  Norwayï¿½s sovereign wealth fund blocks investment in multiple companies on environmental or other ethical concerns. Other major companies to blacklisted include nuclear weapons manufacturers such as Airbus, BAE Systems, Boeing and Serco and the tobacco companies Altria and British American Tobacco.  G4S is the only company listed on either American or western European stock markets to be blacklisted by the council for alleged human rights violations. It joins 12 other companies banned on human rights grounds, including Hansae Yes24, a Korean Nike supplier, Evergreen Marine, a Taiwanese shipbreaker, and Atal, a Polish property developer.  Vaidehee Sachdev, a senior research manager at ShareAction, said: ï¿½This is an unprecedented move by one of the worldï¿½s largest pension funds. More than just a slap on the wrist, this signals to G4S and the wider market that the absolute protection of workersï¿½ rights is non-negotiable, and that business models that squeeze worker freedoms for a profit are totally unviable.  ï¿½The question now is what are our pension funds and asset managers in the UK going to do? They should have this as a top priority in their engagements with G4S management.ï¿½  Invesco, a US investor with significant London operations, is the largest shareholder in G4S, followed by US firm Harris Associates and London-based investors, Mondrian Investment Partners and Schroders.  G4S said in a statement it agreed that migrant workers deserved to be treated with dignity and respect, and said it had hired a migrant worker coordinator to address the issues raised by the council.  A spokeswoman said: ï¿½We carried out a robust investigation into the issues raised by the Council on Ethics into G4Sï¿½s employment practices in Qatar and the UAE. We are making good progress on our action plan to reinforce our high standards in relation to employee recruitment and welfare provisions in the Middle East.ï¿½  G4S shares slid 2.5% to 203p in lunchtime trading on Thursday.ÿ14.11.2019ÿNorwegian wealth fund blacklists G4S shares over human rights concerns
9006ÿ20/11/2019ÿ7ÿTestÿ1ÿPeopleÿ1ÿnegativeÿÿÿÿÿhttps://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/01/two-tier-workforce-wework-protests-show-dark-side-of-outsourcingÿBlowing on horns, waving black flags and playing blaring sirens and loud music through a speaker system, protesters outside a WeWork branch in Shoreditch, London, demanded the attention of those going in and out last week.  The deafening demonstration ï¿½ which called for four cleaners who have lost their jobs at WeWork to be reinstated ï¿½ made for a stark contrast with the cool, modern environment inside, with its standup-friendly furniture, ï¿½writableï¿½ walls and endless stream of freshly roasted coffee.  The protest highlighted a problem that has become widespread: many modern multinationals in cities across the globe are now staffed by what amounts to a two-tier workforce. Employees enjoy protected employment advantages, while the outsourced people who keep the workspaces running ï¿½ who clean them and keep them safe ï¿½ often have more precarious roles with inferior terms and conditions.  The office rental company WeWork has grown into an empire, developing a reputation for trendy workspaces where entrepreneurs and firms can collaborate over craft beers or coffee in light airy lounges. It operates offices in around 100 cities and has around 527,000 members and 528 locations. (Guardian US leases space from WeWork.)  WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann, who announced on Tuesday that he was stepping down from the role of company CEO. Photograph: Michael Kovac/Getty Images for WeWork  In recent weeks, however, its parent company has been beset with problems, scrapping plans for a $20bn IPO, and WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann announced he was stepping down as chief executive.  The brand sets great store by the concept of community, but that doesnï¿½t necessarily include the cleaners, who, at least in the UK, are all outsourced workers.  The dispute in London centres on four cleaners who were employed by CCM Facilities, which provides cleaning services at WeWorkï¿½s London offices. (There was a fifth dismissed cleaner involved, but he appears to have been rehired by CCM.)  The protest ï¿½ as with one a week earlier at No 1 Poultry near Bank ï¿½ was organised by the Cleaners and Allied Independent Workers Union (CAIWU), which represents more than 1,000 workers, mainly in Londonï¿½s cleaning industry.  The union claims the cleaners were unfairly dismissed by CCM shortly after WeWork said it no longer wanted them on its premises. It claims there was insufficient evidence to prove allegations of misconduct made against the cleaners.  Alberto Durango, CAIWU general secretary, said: ï¿½Each of the [four] cases was so-called third-party pressure, which is the client ï¿½ in this case WeWork ï¿½ saying we donï¿½t want these people here. Theyï¿½re the clients and they requested the removal of these guys. They have the power to say to CCM to reinstate these workers. For a cleaner, they really need their job.ï¿½  CAIWU members protest outside WeWorkï¿½s offices in One Poultry, near Bank, in the City of London. Photograph: Mark Kerrison/Alamy Live News  While the client has the right to say they no longer want a person on its premises, ï¿½they shouldnï¿½t be as arrogant [as] to say ï¿½I donï¿½t want this person hereï¿½ï¿½, said Durango.  Three of the dismissed workers were originally from Colombia and one from Ecuador. The details of their cases vary.  One, Julian Ortiz, says he asked a member of security at the Paddington branch of WeWork where he worked if he could borrow a projector, and that they agreed. When the company told him the staff member didnï¿½t have the authority to agree to that, he brought the projector back promptly, he says. He was suspended by CCM a few days later, he says. Heï¿½s now found part-time work, but misses his old job: ï¿½I felt so happy when I was working with WeWork.ï¿½  Another, Jorge Montoya, says his daughter was working at the same WeWork branch that he was, so WeWork requested he be moved to another one. He claims CCM offered him work at another site but later dismissed him.  A third worker, who doesnï¿½t speak fluent English, was cleaning a staircase when someone approached the wet floor, said Durango. ï¿½In broken English he says ï¿½donï¿½t passï¿½ï¿½ and the person took offence, the CAIWU general secretary said. A fourth cleaner was accused of making a racist remark to a member of staff, a claim he denies.  While outsourcing isnï¿½t a new phenomenon, the scale of it is ï¿½ itï¿½s one of the biggest growth industries in the past decade. Cleaners, security guards and catering staff at multinational companies, universities, hospitals and other big organisations (including the Guardian) are often employed by other companies.  The two-tier system means the balance of power at outsourcing firms is firmly in favour of the client: they wonï¿½t want to lose a valuable customer. Client companies using outsourced workers often insist in contracts that they retain the right to request a worker be removed, said Molly De Dios of the United Voices of the World union, a large proportion of whose members work in the cleaning sector. And the clients use that right.  ï¿½Unfortunately, client requests for removal are very common,ï¿½ said De Dios.  CAIWU members protest outside the Shoreditch offices of global office rental company WeWork in London. Photograph: Peter Marshall/Alamy Live News  While there will be instances when a company has genuine concerns about someoneï¿½s professional performance or conduct, sometimes the reasons for the removal appear more suspect, she said. The union has heard allegations about cleaning companies colluding with clients when they want to get rid of an outsourced worker for a spurious reason without repercussions.  In some cases there are claims of false accusations, or workers being dismissed simply because someone took a dislike to them. ï¿½The cleaning sector, and the service sector more generally, is a massive migrant labour workforce, and language can be used to manipulate,ï¿½ said De Dios.  She added: ï¿½The big issue of outsourcing is workers are completely unprotected against it. Clients often have written into a contract that they have the right to request the removal from site of any worker without having to provide explanations, so the only case that an employer would be liable in that event would be if you could prove that they requested their removal on grounds of discrimination.ï¿½  United Voices of the World, which is currently involved in seven live disputes in the UK, fights to bring cleaners in-house. ï¿½Outsourcing is a complete farce, it shouldnï¿½t exist at all ï¿½ itï¿½s terrible,ï¿½ De Dios said. ï¿½ï¿½It leaves workers with fewer rights and it means the clients who are essentially the employer (because the cleaners are cleaning their site) arenï¿½t legally responsible or liable for anything.ï¿½  Outsourced workers are treated as a disposable and inferior workforce, said De Dios. she gave the example of a cleaner at a London hospital who was told she couldnï¿½t use the staff room and to eat her lunch on the stairs.  When a client asks for the removal of a worker, the employer should investigate the basis of the objection and offer alternative jobs, said De Dios. She said that in some instances they are not properly investigated and the alternative jobs offered involve a long commute, or fewer hours, or the employee isnï¿½t given long enough to make a decision.  In the case of the four WeWork cleaners, CCM says two were offered alternative employment that they turned down. However, the CAIWU union claims the workers asked for the details to be sent in writing so they could consider them properly, but were instead told they had declined them.  A CCM Facilities spokesperson said in a statement: ï¿½CCM Facilities Limited take matters of this nature very seriously and we have fully investigated these concerns about work place performance and misconduct.  ï¿½Of the four individuals, two were offered alternative employment, which was declined in both cases. The two other cases resulted in dismissals, which were both upheld at appeal. To CCM Facilities Ltd[ï¿½s] knowledge, none of these individuals have filed employment tribunal cases for unfair dismissal or any other reasons.ï¿½  WeWork declined to comment.ÿ14.11.2019ÿTwo-tier workforce: WeWork protests show dark side of outsourcing

It follows a BBC investigation exposing ""fuel tankering"" by airlines - in which planes are filled with extra fuel, usually to avoid paying higher prices for refuelling at destination airports.  The industry-wide practice could mean extra annual emissions equivalent to those of a large European town.  BA now says that using tankering to cut costs ""may be the wrong thing to do"".  However, the airline added that it also uses the practice for safety and operational reasons, including helping planes to turn around quickly.  BBC Panorama has discovered the airline's planes generated an extra 18,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide last year through fuel tankering.  Cost savings made on a single flight can be as small as just over ï¿½10 - though savings can run to hundreds of pounds.  Researchers have estimated that one in five of all European airlines' flights involves some element of fuel tankering.  The practice on European routes could result in additional annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to that produced by a town of 100,000 people.  Critics say the widespread use of the practice undermines the aviation industry's claims that it is committed to reducing its carbon emissions.  John Sauven, Greenpeace UK's executive director, told the BBC that fuel tankering was a ""classic example of a company putting profit before planet"".  Responding to BA's decision to carry out a review, Mr Sauven, said it showed how the airline industry had been treating climate change ""like a PR problem"".  ""This is why we need government-enforced reduction targets to ensure airlines take responsibility for the damage their emissions are causing,"" he said.  International Airlines Group (IAG), the company that owns BA, says it wants to be the world's leading airline group on sustainability.  BA boasts it even prints its in-flight magazine on lighter paper to save weight.  Yet BBC Panorama has seen dozens of internal BA documents that show up to six tonnes of extra fuel have been loaded onto planes in this way. It has also seen evidence that Easyjet carries extra fuel in this way.  Airlines can save money from the fact that the price of aviation fuel differs between European destinations.  BA insiders say the company - like many airlines running short haul routes in Europe - has computer software that calculates whether costs can be saved by fuel tankering.  The software will calculate whether there is a cost saving to be made. If there is, crews load up the extra fuel.  An example of documents seen by Panorama show that a recent BA flight to Italy carried nearly three tonnes of extra fuel.  The extra weight meant the plane emitted more than 600kg of additional carbon dioxide - the same emissions one person is responsible for on a return flight to New York.  The cost saving on that trip was less than ï¿½40, but the documents Panorama has seen show that it can be even lower than that.  IAG made an annual profit of ï¿½2.9bn (ï¿½2.6bn) in 2018, about 80% of which came from BA.  A BA insider described the practice as ""hypocritical"".  ""For such a big company to be trying to save such small amounts while emitting so much extra CO2 seems unjustifiable in the current climate,"" he said.  In response to the claims, the chief executive of BA's parent company, IAG, announced the airline would carry out a review of the practice.  On Friday, Willie Walsh told investors that the airline wanted to ensure it was not ""incentivising the wrong behaviour"" from managers.  ""Because clearly the financial saving would have incentivised us to do fuel tankering,"" he said.  ""But maybe... this the wrong thing to do and the wrong thing to incentive. So we want to make sure we have our incentives aligned to the right activities so ensure financial sustainability but also environmental sustainability.""  BA said it was common practice for the airline industry to carry additional fuel on some flights.  The airline said for BA this applies mainly to short-haul destinations ""where there are considerable price differences between European airports"".  It said the additional emissions from the airline represented approximately 2% of the total extra emissions generated by all airlines tankering fuel in Europe, based on research by Eurocontrol.  BA pointed out that since 2012 all flights within Europe had been covered by the EU Emissions Trading System.  It added that from 2020 the company would offset all CO2 emissions from its UK domestic flights.  Easyjet said it had reduced the level of tankering in recent years and that it only took place on a tiny proportion of flights for operational and commercial reasons.  Eurocontrol, the body which coordinates air traffic control for Europe, has calculated that tankering in Europe resulted in 286,000 tonnes of extra fuel being burnt every year, and the emission of an additional 901,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide.  It calculates that the practice saved airlines a total of ï¿½265m (ï¿½228m) a year.  Eurocontrol described the practice as ""questionable"" at a time when aviation is being challenged for its contribution to climate change."ÿ14.11.2019ÿClimate change: British Airways reviews 'fuel-tankering' over climate concerns

It follows complaints - including from Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak - that algorithms used to set limits might be inherently biased against women.  New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS) has contacted Goldman Sachs, which runs the Apple Card.  Any discrimination, intentional or not, ""violates New York law"", the DFS said.  The Bloomberg news agency reported on Saturday that tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson had complained that the Apple Card gave him 20 times the credit limit that his wife got.  In a tweet, Mr Hansson said the disparity was despite his wife having a better credit score.  Later, Mr Wozniak, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs, tweeted that the same thing happened to him and his wife despite their having no separate bank accounts or separate assets.  Banks and other lenders are increasingly using machine-learning technology to cut costs and boost loan applications.  But Mr Hansson, creator of the programming tool Ruby on Rails, said it highlights how algorithms, not just people, can discriminate.  US healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group is being investigated over claims an algorithm favoured white patients over black patients.  Mr Hansson said in a tweet: ""Apple Card is a sexist program. It does not matter what the intent of individual Apple reps are, it matters what THE ALGORITHM they've placed their complete faith in does. And what it does is discriminate.""  He said that as soon as he raised the issue his wife's credit limit was increased.  The DFS said in a statement that it ""will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex"".  ""Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class violates New York law.""  The BBC has contacted Goldman Sachs for comment.  On Saturday, the investment bank told Bloomberg: ""Our credit decisions are based on a customer's creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law.""  The Apple Card, launched in August, is Goldman's first credit card. The Wall Street investment bank has been offering more products to consumers, including personal loans and savings accounts through its Marcus online bank.  The iPhone maker markets Apple Card on its website as a ""new kind of credit card, created by Apple, not a bank"".  Without access to the Goldman Sachs computers, it's impossible to be certain of what is going on. The fact there appears to be a correlation between gender and credit doesn't necessarily mean one is causing the other. Even so, the suspicion is that unintentional bias has crept into the system.  That could be because when the algorithms involved were developed, they were trained on a data set in which women indeed posed a greater financial risk than the men. This could cause the software to spit out lower credit limits for women in general, even if the assumption it is based on is not true for the population at large.  Alternatively, the problem might lie in the data the algorithms are now being fed. For example, within married couples, men might be more likely to take out big loans solely using their name rather than having done so jointly, and the data may not have been adjusted to take this into account.  A further complication is that the software involved can act as a ""black box"", coming up with judgements without providing a way to unravel how each was determined.  ""There have been a lot of strides taken in the last five to six years to improve the explainability of decisions taken based on machine learning techniques,"" commented Jonathan Williams of Mk2 Consulting. ""But in some cases, it's still not as good as it could be.""  In any case, for now Apple would prefer Goldman Sachs take the heat, despite the fact its marketing materials state that its card was ""created by Apple, not a bank"". But that's a tricky position to maintain.

That's compared to roughly 3.3 billion fake accounts removed in all of 2018. As much as 5% of its monthly user base of nearly 2.5 billion consists of fake accounts, the company said, despite advances in technology that have allowed Facebook to catch more fake accounts the moment they are created. The disclosure highlights the scale of the challenge before Facebook as it prepares for a high-stakes election season in the United States, as well as the 2020 US census. Analysts and watchdogs are bracing for a wave of fake and misleading content on social media following revelations about election meddling in 2016.  On a call with reporters, CEO Mark Zuckerberg framed the large number of fake accounts that have been removed as a sign of how seriously the company is taking this issue and called on other platforms to make similar disclosures. ""Because our numbers are high doesn't mean there's that much more harmful content. It just means we're working harder to identify this content and that's why it's higher,"" he said on Wednesday. Facebook and YouTube say they are removing content mentioning potential whistleblower's name The number of fake accounts disabled by the company peaked earlier in the year, when Facebook said it shut down more than 2 billion in the period from January to March. It removed relatively fewer fake accounts over the next three months ï¿½ 1.5 billion ï¿½ which Facebook attributed to improvements in its blocking of new fakes. But the number is on the rise again: Facebook's latest report shows it eliminated 1.7 billion fake accounts from July to September. The announcement came as part of Facebook's newest transparency report, which for the first time includes information about Instagram. Between April and September, the Instagram data show, Facebook took down roughly 3 million pieces of content that violated its policies against selling drugs. The company acted against another 95,000 pieces of Instagram content related to gun sales. The Instagram-focused data also cover the company's enforcement efforts against child exploitation. suicide and self-injury. and terrorist propaganda. But the reporting on Instagram does not cover topics Facebook includes for its main platform, such as bullying and hate speech. During the call with reporters, an executive noted that Facebook's systems are being used extensively by Instagram to detect harmful content. As the company has faced calls from politicians and observers to be broken up, Facebook executives have repeatedly argued that its size and resources make it better equipped to fight misinformation and provide a safe environment for users. Earlier this year, Facebook began allowing its hate speech algorithms to begin automatically removing content that it believes violates the company's policies, the report said. One result of that decision has been a sharp spike in the amount of hate speech taken off Facebook.  As many as 7 million pieces of hate speech content were removed from Facebook between July and September, according to the report, a nearly 60% increase from the period between April and June. Of the 7 million, more than 80% was detected by Facebook before a user saw the content, the company said. Facebook has come under increasing criticism from minority activists and civil rights groups over the spread of hate speech on its platform. The report comes days after civil rights leaders met with Zuckerberg to press him on the ways that divisive, hurtful language can disproportionately harm vulnerable populations on social media.

Google (GOOGL) plans to offer checking accounts to customers starting next year, a source familiar with Google's plans told CNN Business. Google is partnering with Citigroup (C) and a credit union at Stanford University for the initiative. The Wall Street Journal first reported Google's entry into checking accounts. ""We're exploring how we can partner with banks and credit unions in the US to offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay, helping their customers benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools, while keeping their money in an FDIC or NCUA-insured account,"" a company spokesperson said.  But Google doesn't plan to take center stage on the checking accounts. Instead, the financial institutions' brands will be put on the accounts and banks will be responsible for the financial plumbing and compliance. Partner banks and credit unions will offer these smart checking accounts through Google Pay. Google also hasn't decided whether the accounts would charge fees. The push into checking accounts is the latest instance of a Big Tech company moving into the financial services space. Amazon also wants to introduce checking accounts for customers. Facebook announced its Libra cryptocurrency project earlier this year. And Apple has teamed up with Goldman Sachs to launch a credit card, while its Apple Pay service has become a go-to payment method for many iPhone customers. Google is attempting to deepen its relationship with consumers by entering into finance, Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, told CNN Business. ""The company has an unmatched position within the consumer life cycle and now they're trying to leverage where they are,"" Ives said. Google already offers smart home devices like Nest and Google Assistant and just entered into health and wellness world with its planned acquisition of Fitbit. ""The missing piece is banking,"" said Ives. Ives said Google's initiative probably won't cause big banks any concern for now, but Big Tech's ongoing expansion of its financial footprint will likely pose a competitive threat in the future -- especially as it shows no signs of letting up. ""This is just the tip of the spear in terms of where [tech giants are] going,"" said Ives. Lawmakers in Washington, who are already investigating the dominance of big tech companies, will probably review Google's move closely.  Google's effort could draw scrutiny given Washington's distaste for both Big Tech and big banks, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen and Company, said in an analyst note.

Humans have produced more than 8.3 billion tons of plastic since the 1950s, according to the United Nations. Most of that is ending up in landfills and could take centuries to decompose. New York-based biotech startup Ecovative aims to cut down on this waste with mycelium, the root-like structure of a mushroom. Although we're used to seeing mushrooms growing above the ground, mycelium is what grows below it.  ""[Plastic waste is] literally gumming up the cogs of the ecosystem of planet Earth,"" Ecovative's CEO and co-founder Eben Bayer told CNN Business. ""[A natural alternative] can address a lot of our serious problems especially in the category of single-use plastics."" Mycelium provides a natural alternative to packaging materials made out styrofoam The company says it has developed a way to grow mycelium into specific shapes and sizes. The method, according to Ecovative, involves taking organic plant waste and inoculating it with mycelium. After the mycelium grows through and around the agricultural materials, it binds them together, providing a natural alternative to packaging materials made out styrofoam. It's a process that takes about a week with minimal water and electricity consumed to make the parts. This startup is saving crops by making 'super bees' At the end of the mycelium substance's useful life, you can break it up and you can put it in your own garden. ""So it's a nutrient, not a pollutant,"" he added. It's a vision that has helped Ecovative attract millions from investors like 3M Company, the conglomerate behind Post-it notes and Scotch tape, and even a $9.1 million contract with the US Department of Defense. ""These sorts of technologies are very exciting,"" David S. Hibbett, a professor in the biology department at Clark University, told CNN Business. ""Whether or not they're cost effective or commercially viable with traditional materials is another matter."" Darby Hoover, senior resource specialist at the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council, told CNN Business that ""the bigger issue here is rethinking our reliance on disposable packaging overall."" Still, Hoover is encouraged by Ecovative's work. ""But there is also a hunger for more sustainable alternatives and we welcome more sustainable options to hit the market."" The company, which launched in 2007, is now focused on developing next-generation mycelium materials to disrupt the animal farming industry with everything from vegan leather to plant-based meat. These alternatives often use ingredients such as pea proteins and genetically engineered soy, but none have -- at least successfully -- used mycelium. The company sees a future for its product in the plant-based meat business, building industry and medical field. ""[It] really has boundless possibilities,"" said Bayer. Mycelium bacon is still in its testing phase. In September, Ecovative spun off its plant-based meat business, Atlast Food Co., but the two companies are still working together. The company also believes mycelium could play a major role in construction, as mycelium building materials are both insulative and structural and can be used in the same ways as conventional building material, Bayer said.  In fact, packaging materials may be just the start. The startup has its eyes on another audacious goal: building organs. ""My dream is to one day grow a lung and seed it with lung cells and use the mycelium to create the capillary network and use the human cells to create the actual lung,"" said Bayer.

UBSï¿½s advisers engaged in acts that deceived or were likely to deceive its clients about the spreads and prices on bond and structured product transations, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said Thursday.  ï¿½The conduct of UBS through its representatives is unacceptable and has no place in the financial services industry where trust and integrity are paramount,ï¿½ MAS Deputy Managing Director Ong Chong Tee said in the statement.  The regulatorï¿½s action follows a penalty imposed on UBS in Hong Kong earlier this week for systematically overcharging private banking clients by manipulating the price on bond and structured product trades. To hide the charges, UBS sometimes falsified account statements by misreporting the spread amounts for the trades, according to the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.  The Singapore penalty related to transactions executed from 2014 onwards, though UBS has undertaken to compensate all affected clients for misconduct between 2008 and 2017, the MAS said.  UBS said the latest fine resolves a matter it had self-identified and reported to regulators in Hong Kong and Singapore.

A Greenpeace reportexternal link released on Monday examines the supply chain of four major food companies ï¿½ Nestlï¿½, Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Mondel?z ï¿½ and compares them to palm oil suppliers that are under investigation for starting illegal fires. Nestlï¿½ is accused of being linked to suppliers that are suspected to be behind 9,700 fire hotspots this year.  hand  stats  The multinational is linked to 20 producers that have been sanctioned for illegal fires in Indonesia and to 21 sealed palm oil concessions that directly feed its supply chain in 2019. According to Greenpeace, most fires are likely to be deliberately caused by palm oil producers to clear land for plantations.    ï¿½The producer groups responsible include companies convicted by the Indonesian courts or sanctioned by the government, many of which have failed to pay the compensation ordered to restore the burned areas,ï¿½ says the Greenpeace report.    Indonesia suffered its worst fires in 2015, which cost the economy an estimated $16 billion, compared to $8 billion in palm oil exports that year. The country responded by making companies liable for forest fires in their concessions irrespective of the cause. Despite the measures, the situation in 2019 was almost as bad as in 2015, with 857,000 hectares of land burned by September, resulting in 465 megatonnes of CO2 (close to the United Kingdomï¿½s annual greenhouse gas emissions) released by October.     Nestlï¿½ is aware of the Greenpeace report and is investigating whether any of the mills mentioned are in their supply chain.    ï¿½We are verifying occurrences of land cleared and burning, as we do for other deforestation clearances. We will immediately cease sourcing from any supplier found to be linked to any deforestation activity,ï¿½ a spokesperson told swissinfo.ch.   Greenpeace has also accused Nestlï¿½ of a lack of transparency in listing its palm oil suppliers. In the case of Indonesian forest fires, problematic suppliers like the Korindo and Salim group were suspended by Nestlï¿½ but their subsidiaries PT Mitra Indo Cemerlang (Korindo) and Salim Ivomas Pratama mills (Salim Group) were listed in the companyï¿½s supply chain.   ï¿½The current mill list on our website reflects our supply chain mapping as of April 2018. Since then, several mills have been suspended or otherwise removed,ï¿½ says Nestlï¿½. ÿ14.11.2019ÿNestlï¿½ accused of sourcing palm oil linked to forest fires in Indonesia

Starting this week, however, Pizza Hut will introduce a limited-time test of a plant-based pizza topping served up in a round pizza box.  The test of both innovations will take place exclusively at one Pizza Hut location in Phoenix where Americaï¿½s Original Pizza Company will introduce the new Garden Specialty Pizza topped with Incogmeato by MorningStar Farms Italian sausage.  ï¿½At Pizza Hut we donï¿½t do anything halfway and improving the customer experience and delivering a better tasting pizza is our core mission,ï¿½ said Marianne Radley, chief brand officer, Pizza Hut. ï¿½When we talk about feeding more possibilities we mean itï¿½and I canï¿½t wait to share these two new industry-changing innovations with our customers.ï¿½  Pizza Hut partnered with Zume, a company pioneering the shift to a more sustainable future of food, to design a way to put a round pizza in a round box. Not only does the round box contain less overall packaging compared to a typical square pizza box, itï¿½s also industrially compostable (where available) and interlocks easily to ensure a smoother delivery. In other words, no pizza insurance policy needed and freed up space in the fridge for leftovers.  Following the event in Phoenix, Pizza Hut will look at ways to roll the box out more widely in the near future.  ï¿½This revolutionary round boxï¿½the result of a two-year journeyï¿½is the most innovative packaging weï¿½ve rolled out to date,ï¿½ said Nicolas Burquier, chief customer and operations officer, Pizza Hut. ï¿½The round box was engineered to make our products taste even betterï¿½by delivering hotter, crispier pizzas. This box is a win-winï¿½it will improve the pizza-eating experience for our customers and simplify the operating experience for our team members.ï¿½  Additionally, this limited-time test run of the plant-based Italian sausage Garden Specialty Pizza topping will feature Incogmeato Italian sausage, onions, mushrooms and banana peppers and will be served exclusively on Pizza Hutï¿½s large, hand-tossed crust.  Customers in the Phoenix area were encouraged to stop in at the Pizza Hut restaurant located at 3602 E.

As costs skyrocket for renters and potential homebuyersï¿½and as the availability of affordable housing fails to keep pace with the regionï¿½s growthï¿½community members like teachers, firefighters, first responders, and service workers are increasingly being forced to relocate to cheaper housing further away from their jobs. Nearly 30,000 people left San Francisco between April and June of this year and homeownership in the Bay Area is at a seven-year low. ï¿½Before the world knew the name Silicon Valley, and long before we carried technology in our pockets, Apple called this region home, and we feel a profound civic responsibility to ensure it remains a vibrant place where people can live, have a family and contribute to the community,ï¿½ said Tim Cook, Appleï¿½s CEO. ï¿½Affordable housing means stability and dignity, opportunity and pride. When these things fall out of reach for too many, we know the course we are on is unsustainable, and Apple is committed to being part of the solution.ï¿½ Apple designed its initiative to accelerate and expand new housing production. jump-start long-term developments that would otherwise not be possible. help first-time buyers purchase homes. and support new housing and programs to reduce homelessness, after extensively studying the issue and listening to different perspectives. In partnership with Governor Gavin Newsom, the state of California and community-based organizations, Apple is providing a significant investment that offers statewide housing support as well as funding for projects in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. ï¿½This unparalleled financial commitment to affordable housing, and the innovative strategies at the heart of this initiative, are proof that Apple is serious about solving this issue. I hope other companies follow their lead,ï¿½ said Gavin Newsom, governor of California. ï¿½The sky-high cost of housing. . . can only be fixed by building more housing. This partnership with Apple will allow the state of California to do just that.ï¿½ Appleï¿½s commitment to the state of California includes their new $1 billion affordable housing investment fund committed to the state of California, which is a first-of-its-kind affordable housing fund that will provide the state and others with an open line of credit to develop and build additional new, very low- to moderate-income housing faster, and at a lower cost. Additionally, the tech company is working with the state to launch their $1 billion first-time homebuyer mortgage assistance fund for first-time homebuyers, which will provide aspiring homebuyers with financing and down payment assistance. The funding commitment to California is expected to take approximately two years to be fully utilized depending on the availability of projects. Capital returned to Apple will be reinvested in future projects over the next five years. In addition to these initiatives, Apple is working to identify private developers who, with the right financing and investment, are ready to start construction on affordable housing projects in the Bay Area immediately. Apple will also provide $200 million to support new lower-income housing and help some of the most vulnerable populations in the Bay Area:   $150 million Bay Area housing fund: In a public-private partnership, Apple is launching a new $150 million affordable housing fund with partners including Housing Trust Silicon Valley to support new affordable housing projects. The fund will consist of long-term forgivable loans and grants.   $50 million to support vulnerable populations: Apple will donate $50 million to support Destination: Homeï¿½s efforts to address homelessness in Silicon Valley and focus its contribution on driving systemic change across the many factors affecting homelessness. Apple will also be identifying similar efforts in Northern and Southern California, focusing on strategies that both end and prevent homelessness. ï¿½Weï¿½re so grateful that Apple has made this significant philanthropic commitment towards solving Silicon Valleyï¿½s growing homelessness crisis,ï¿½ said Jennifer Loving, Destination: Homeï¿½s CEO. ï¿½With this generous contribution, weï¿½ll be able to scale two proven strategies for reducing homelessness in our community: the production of more permanently affordable housing for our most vulnerable residents and an expansion of prevention programs that help at-risk families remain stably housed.ï¿½ One of the first projects Apple will fund as part of its philanthropic commitment to Destination: Home will be an expansion of the organizationï¿½s Homelessness Prevention System, a network of service providers offering employment assistance, legal aid, rent subsidy, case management and other support to reduce homelessness. ï¿½We have worked closely with leading experts to put together a plan that confronts this challenge on all fronts, from the critical need to increase housing supply, to support for first-time homebuyers and young families, to essential philanthropy to assist those at greatest risk,ï¿½ said Lisa Jackson, Appleï¿½s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. ï¿½Apple is committed to being a good neighbor and helping to write the next chapter of the region that has been a great home of innovation and creativity for generations.ï¿½ By putting its $2.5 billion investment to use across multiple initiatives and partners, Appleï¿½s housing initiative offers a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach to address some of the most urgent challenges facing affordable housing in California. This initiative is a major step, and Apple will continue looking for ways to support communities and affordable housing.ÿ21.11.2019ÿApple Commits $2.5 Billion to Combatting Housing Crisis in California

Google will roll out the ban within a week in the U.K., in advance of a Dec. 12 general election. The ban will take effect in the European Union by the end of the year and in the rest of the world on Jan. 6, the company said in a blog post. Under the new policy, political ads can only be targeted based on usersï¿½ age, gender, and location at the postal-code level. Political advertisers will also still be able to display ads based on the content of the page a user is viewing. Advertisers would no longer be able to target political ads based on usersï¿½ interests inferred from browsing or search history. So-called microtargeting, in which advertisers can limit their messaging to narrow slices of people based on their personal preferences or online behavior, has been criticized as enabling campaigns to single out groups susceptible to misinformation. Googleï¿½s announcement is the latest in a series of new policies from digital-advertisingï¿½s giantsï¿½with each of the major platforms taking a different approach. Last month Facebook Inc. announced it would no longer fact-check ads from political campaigns. Then Twitter Inc. announced it would no longer accept political ads and would impose targeting restrictions on cause-related advertising. In its blog post, Google also clarified its policy on politicians making false claims, saying they wouldnï¿½t be allowed on its platforms, consistent with the companyï¿½s broader prohibitions against misleading advertising. In doing so, it effectively committed to fact-checking political ads and taking down those that make false claims. ï¿½We expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limitedï¿½but we will continue to do so for clear violations,ï¿½ the company said in the blog post. Facebook on Wednesday also left the door open to more coming changes. ï¿½For over a year, weï¿½ve provided unprecedented transparency into all U.S. federal and state campaignsï¿½and we prohibit voter suppression in all ads. As weï¿½ve said, we are looking at different ways we might refine our approach to political ads,ï¿½ a Facebook spokesman said. The Trump campaign used targeted advertising to great effect in 2016, particularly on Facebook, and candidates from both parties have ramped up spending this year. Digital political ad spending is expected to reach $2.9 billion in 2020, up from $1.4 billion in 2016, according to Borrell Associates Inc., a consulting firm. Brad Parscale, who is heading President Trumpï¿½s reelection effort, criticized Googleï¿½s move in a tweet, saying, ï¿½Political elites & Big Tech want to rig elections,ï¿½ noting that it would hurt Mr. Trump as well as leading Democratic candidates. Watchdogs including lawmakers and advocacy groups have called for greater oversight of political ads following revelations that Russian entities purchased digital ads designed to influence the 2016 vote, many of them spreading misinformation. Federal Election Commission Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub recently called for a ban on microtargeting. Googleï¿½s new policy will apply to ads on Google Search, Googleï¿½s video platform YouTube and third-party sites across the web purchased through Googleï¿½s ad-buying software. Google imposed certain regulations on political advertising for U.S. federal races last year. It will expand those existing regulations to cover U.S. state-level candidates and officeholders, ballot measures and ads that mention federal or state political parties. YouTube has allowed advertisers to target their ads based on thousands of categories, including a userï¿½s household income, education level, profession, marital or homeownership status or the age of their children. YouTube touted these categories to political ad-buyers in a presentation given within the past year, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The presentation also suggested political ad buyers take advantage of targeting based on so-called affinity audiences, which it tagged with monikers such as ï¿½Avid Investors,ï¿½ ï¿½Country Music Fans,ï¿½ ï¿½Green Livingï¿½ and ï¿½Spanish-Language Music.ï¿½ It also touted the ability to target users based on their searches, providing an example of targeting users who had searched for information about taxes. In the U.S., Google has also previously allowed political ad buyers to target based on public voter records and general political affiliations, including left leaning, right leaning and independent. Since May 2018, Google has banned political ads from making false statements and provided fact-checking to enforce the policy. The company required customers purchasing these ads to register and verify their organization. It also preserved these ads in a publicly available archive along with estimated data on the amount spent on the ads. These policies initially applied only to federal candidates and officeholders within the U.S. but will expand to state-level politics under the new policy. The new changes are unlikely to hurt Googleï¿½s bottom line, or stem the flow of ad dollars to digital platforms as the 2020 elections approach. ï¿½Advertising dollars follow eyeballs. So while campaigns will have to adjust to these new rules, Googleï¿½s platforms are still effective for reaching voters online,ï¿½ said Reid Vineis, vice president of conservative digital ad-buying firm Majority Strategies. ï¿½It is unlikely that this change would hurt Googleï¿½s political advertising revenue.ï¿½ Mr. Vineis also said the level of targeting allowed by Google ï¿½will still allow advertisers to generally reach homogeneous voting blocs.ï¿½ Advertisers often use ZIP Codes as a proxy for demographics such as race, income and education level. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Google was considering changing its political ad policy and that employees speculated it could relate to audience targeting. ÿ21.11.2019ÿGoogle to Restrict Political Ad Targeting on Its Platforms

The suit follows an earlier case that Intel filed against Fortress in October. Intel withdrew that suit and on Wednesday filed a new version in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with Apple joining as a plaintiff. Intel and Apple allege that Fortress and firms it either owned or whose patent portfolios it effectively controlled - and which do not make any technology products - stockpiled patents for the primary purpose of suing technology companies and did so in a manner that violated U.S. antitrust laws. ï¿½Apple has suffered economic harm in the form of litigation costs and diversion of resources away from innovation to respond to these entitiesï¿½ serial nuisance suits,ï¿½ Apple wrote in the complaint. Fortress and Japanese parent SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When Intel filed the similar lawsuit in October, a Fortress spokesman told Reuters the company was ï¿½confident in our business practices and our legal position and view this lawsuit as meritlessï¿½. In the filing on Wednesday, Apple said firms connected to Fortress had filed at least 25 lawsuits against the iPhone maker demanding $2.6 billion to $5.1 billion in damages. One of the suits, Apple wrote in its filing, alleged that Apple violated a step-counting patent in its devices with health-tracking apps. Two Fortress-connected firms, Uniloc USA and Uniloc Luxembourg, ï¿½have disclosed that they believe they are entitled to damages of between $1.41 and $2.75 per Apple product, for total damages in the range of $375 to $732 million,ï¿½ Apple wrote in its complaint. ï¿½The apparent precision of the per-unit damages request is a facade. Uniloc USA and Uniloc Luxembourg simply adopted the amounts that Apple sought from Samsung in litigation for Appleï¿½s patents,ï¿½ Apple wrote, referring to South Koreaï¿½s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS). Intel said it could not comment beyond the court filing. Apple, which invested in SoftBankï¿½s first Vision Fund and in July was listed among organizations pledging to contribute to a second fund, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ÿ21.11.2019ÿApple, Intel file antitrust case against SoftBank-owned firm over patent practices

Scientists from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), along with other collaborators, recently revealed that Chinaï¿½s coal-fired power plants met ultra-low emission (ULE) standards ahead of schedule and also achieved substantial emission reductions between 2014 and 2017. The study, entitled ï¿½Substantial emission reductions from Chinese power plants after the introduction of ultra-low emission standardsï¿½ was published in Nature Energy on October 7th. China began its more recent ambitious shift towards sustainability back in September 2014 by introducing ambitious ULE standards for renovating coal-fired power generating units. The new and stringent standards for coal-fired power plants called for 580 million kW of existing installed capacityï¿½71% of the total in 2014, to meet ULE standards by 2020. The researchers found, however, that 591 million kW of pre-existing coal-fired capacity had already been renovated to meet ULE standards by the end of 2017ï¿½i.e., 11 million kW over the original goal. As a result, Chinaï¿½s annual power plant emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter dropped by 65%, 60% and 72% from 2.21, 3.11 and 0.52 million tons in 2014 to 0.77, 1.26 and 0.14 million tons in 2017, respectively. ï¿½The ULE standards, as an example of Chinaï¿½s effective environmental regulation policies, provide insights and implications for reducing power emissions worldwide,ï¿½ said Professor Wang Shouyang of CAS. ï¿½Additionally, these emission reductions can lead to an improvement in air quality and considerable health benefits.ï¿½ As part of their work, the researchers identified three types of units where enhanced ULE compliance could best reduce Chinaï¿½s power generation emissions: 1) coal-fired units, since they represent the largest proportion of total capacity. 2) units in western China. and 3) small-capacity units, since they are dominated by super-polluting units. Professor Tang Ling of the Beijing University of Chemical Technology and Beihang University noted that China achieved its emission goals ahead of schedule due to Chinaï¿½s strict emission supervision system, effective economic incentive mechanisms, and the nationwide application and upgrading of ULE technology. In reporting their results, the researchers used actual monitoring data to show that emissions were 18-92% below recent estimates. This method contrasts with most existing research, which relies on ex-ante studies to estimate how ULE standards will affect power emissions based on assumptions about changes in emission concentrations. ï¿½With coal being the most widely-used fuel in China, cutting the number of thermal power plants within a short timeframe is challenging. The results of this research are encouraging in demonstrating that coal can be used in a much cleaner way to generate electricity,ï¿½ said Dr. Mi Zhifu from University College London. The researchers also developed an open access platformï¿½the China Emissions Accounts for Power plants (CEAP)ï¿½to share accurate and real-time results for each power plant. This publicly available database presents, organizes and analyzes data from Chinaï¿½s continuous emissions monitoring systems network.ÿ21.11.2019ÿChina Achieves Notable Success of Reaching Ultra-Low Emissions in Advance of the 2020 Goal

Throughout the month of August, all 2,300 of their employees were given Fridays off without a decrease in pay. Upon publishing the results of their Summer 2019 Work-Life Choice Challenge, the company was surprised to find that their employees were happier. their meetings were more efficient. and their productivity had skyrocketed by a stunning 40% compared to the same time period from last year. Furthermore, the company saved money by reducing their operational costs. the building consumed 23% less electricity and the workforce reduced their paper consumption by almost 60%. Since 92% of the employees said they preferred the shorter work week, Microsoft Japan will be launching another 4-day work week trial in the winter, although the workforce is still encouraged to take more time off with increasingly flexible scheduling. ï¿½Work a short time, rest well, and learn a lot,ï¿½ Microsoft Japan president and CEO Takuya Hirano said in a statement to Microsoft Japanï¿½s website. ï¿½I want employees to think about and experience how they can achieve the same results with 20% less working time.ï¿½ This is not the first time that a company has enjoyed the benefits of a 4-day work week. Back in March 2018, Auckland-based firm Perpetual Guardian launched a ï¿½world-firstï¿½ trial in which they started giving their 240 employees an extra day off for free. Based on metrics that were utilized by outside researchers, the trial had a multitude of benefits.

This singular scientific achievement was accomplished at Heliogenï¿½s commercial facility in Lancaster, California. Heliogenï¿½s mission is to create the worldï¿½s first technology that can commercially replace fossil fuels with carbon-free, ultra-high temperature heat from the sun and to transform sunlight into fuels at scaleï¿½taking a major step towards solving climate change. Its heat technology represents a key technical breakthrough for concentrated solar thermal. Previous commercial concentrating solar thermal systems have been designed to reach temperatures of up to only 565 degrees Celsiusï¿½useful for power generation, but insufficient for many industrial processes. Many of these processes require much higher temperatures, which have traditionally been reached through the burning of fossil fuels. The potential impact of Heliogenï¿½s patented technology is massive. With temperatures from its concentrating solar thermal technology exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius, Heliogen will be able to replace the fuel that generates greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes with solar energy for the first time. For instance, cement productionï¿½one of the industrial processes well suited to Heliogenï¿½s technologyï¿½alone accounts for more than 7% of global CO2 emissions. ï¿½Today, industrial processes like those used to make cement, steel, and other materials are responsible for more than a fifth of all emissions,ï¿½ said Bill Gates. ï¿½These materials are everywhere in our lives but we donï¿½t have any proven breakthroughs that will give us affordable, zero-carbon versions of them. If weï¿½re going to get to zero-carbon emissions overall, we have a lot of inventing to do. Iï¿½m pleased to have been an early backer of [this] novel solar concentration technology. Its capacity to achieve the high temperatures required for these processes is a promising development in the quest to one day replace fossil fuel.ï¿½ In addition to industrial process heat, Heliogenï¿½s technology roadmap calls for temperatures up to 1,500 degrees Celsius. At that temperature, Heliogen can perform CO2-splitting and water-splitting to make 100% fossil-free fuels such as hydrogen or syngas. Heliogen is able to achieve these breakthrough temperatures as a result of its technology that uniquely uses advanced computer vision software to hyper-accurately align a large array of mirrors to reflect sunlight to a single target. The firmï¿½s founder and chief executive officer is Bill Gross, a lifelong entrepreneur and founder of Idealab. The Heliogen team includes scientists and engineers from Caltech, MIT, and other leading institutions and is based in Pasadena, California. ï¿½The world has a limited window to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions,ï¿½ said Heliogen CEO and founder Bill Gross, who is also the founder and chairman of Idealab. ï¿½Weï¿½ve made great strides in deploying clean energy in our electricity system. But electricity accounts for less than a quarter of global energy demand. Heliogen represents a technological leap forward in addressing the other 75% of energy demand: the use of fossil fuels for industrial processes and transportation. With low-cost, ultra-high temperature process heat, we have an opportunity to make meaningful contributions to solving the climate crisis.ï¿½ÿ21.11.2019ÿWorking in Secret, Bill Gates-Backed Solar Company Reveals Tech That Could Spell the End of Fossil Fuels

While you might think of the Fastback, the Shelby, the Cobra, or the GT500 as some of the most prolific sons of the Detroit motoring giant, the next generation may picture something completely different. Enter the Ford Mustang Mach-E: a Mustang SUV that is entirely electric. Be warnedï¿½this is NOT your fatherï¿½s Mustang. Between boasting an emission-free 0 to 60 time of 3.5 seconds on the GT model, a targeted EPA-estimated range of at least 300 miles, and a crossover design with trunk space both in the back and under the hood of the car, itï¿½s a far cry from the rear-wheel drive V8 bellowers of decades past. The high-tech doesnï¿½t stop there, either. the Mach-E features handle-less, latch-less doors that sense when you are near and illuminate a button that will allow you to enter the vehicle. However, what is undoubtedly the most interesting aspect of the Mach-E is the fact that this will be the first entirely electric version of one of the most successful sports cars in historyï¿½and while even modern descendants of its gas-guzzling predecessors can manage as little as 19 miles per gallon (9 kpl), a brand new Mach-E with the extended-range 98.9 kilowatt hour battery pack requires half the energy to travel just as far. For decades, the idea of what a sports car is and should be has been different depending on which side of the Atlantic Ocean you found yourself. However, as the methods of modern automotive engineering advance, more and more manufacturers are moving towards electric vehicles. Mercedes, Porsche, Audi, Jaguar, and other luxury brands have all released electric models. The advantage Ford has gained from waiting this long to turn their iconic ï¿½ponyï¿½ into a battery-powered beast is that the advancements made in battery-powered automotive technology have developed much further since the release of the first Toyota Prius. For example, while electric cars in the first decade of the new millennium became famous for taking whole days and nights to fully charge, the Mach-E can charge up to 47 miles in just ten minutes at a charging station. In your garage, this can fall to around 22 miles per hour of charge, which is pretty standard for electric vehicles. Starting at $43,000 for the base model and climbing to $60,000 for the GT and First Edition models, the Mach-E represents a significantly more affordable bill of entry for those looking for an electric SUV. The Tesla SUV released last year requires at least $80,000, with the electric Porsche Cayenne coming in at not much less. The Volvo XC40 costs a few thousand less, but doesnï¿½t equal the power and torque of the Mach-E. The 6 versions of the Mach-E will be released in a trickle, with two coming at the end of 2020, two more following in early 2021, and the final two in the spring.

While improvements in technology have made batteries cheaper and more efficient, the average addition of a battery to a vehicle still costs $10,000 and the highest quality ones, made by Tesla, struggle when it comes to affordability for middle class consumers. However, Nikola Motor, a Phoenix-based start-up, claims it has created a new battery cell with double the energy of traditional batteries and at half the weight and cost. On top of that, the batteries donï¿½t use cobalt or nickel, meaning the batteries have a reduced environmental impact as well. This revolutionary change could push electric vehicles from their average 300 mile range to almost 600, making them more convenient and efficient (not to mention environmentally friendly) than fuel-powered vehicles. The company says it will not release a prototype of the battery for at least 10 months as they plan to run demonstrations of the product at their Nikola World technology summit in 2020. Details about the battery are still hazy, but the company says the key to its discovery was starting over from the ground up with a whole new design approach. ÿ21.11.2019ÿA startup has come up with a stronger EV battery without the precious metals

Solar farms surrounded by prairie grasses and budding flowers? Excellent. In Minnesota, itï¿½s becoming common for large solar energy sites to have pollinator-friendly plantings around them. Not only do they provide habitat for the bee and butterfly populations people have been concerned about, but they also promote soil health and probably even boost the solar panelsï¿½ electricity output on warm days. That last bit may sound a bit outlandish, but the hypothesis is that ï¿½thicker vegetation under and around solar panels creates a cooler microclimate, which actually generates more electricity from the panels.ï¿½ This alone might motivate more solar farms around America to plant flowers around their panels. This practice is fairly common in the UK, but itï¿½s starting to gain traction. In fact, Xcel Energy, one of Americaï¿½s biggest utility companies, now requires solar developers to include plans for plantings at proposed sites.

Still, if we act quickly and remove the pesticides responsible for killing mass amounts of insects, we can reverse the tide and save our little critters. This past week, the European Union did just that by voting to ban the most used pesticide in the UK, chlorothalonil, after safety officials reported human health and environmental concerns.

Early Wednesday morning, Nov. 20, 2019, it was removed from outside the Chatham County courthouse. The embattled Confederate monument in downtown Pittsboro came down early Wednesday morning after standing outside the historic courthouse for 112 years, Chatham County officials said. As concerns for public safety grew and the costs of protecting the statue have mounted, officials decided to remove it, according to a county spokeswoman. The county has spent more than $140,000 on security measures, as of Nov. 18, Dudley said. ï¿½Over the past three months, protests continued to escalate week by week, growing larger and more violent,ï¿½ Kara Dudley said in a news release, referring to the protests that happen nearly every Saturday. The monument was removed overnight because it was near two busy highways, she said Wednesday morning, and would minimize the effects on morning traffic. As crews carefully removed the bronze statue at 1:45 a.m., a process that took at least three hours, onlookers applauded and cheered. At 10:46 p.m. Chatham County announced crews were ï¿½working to safely and respectfully dismantle the Confederate monument, which includes the statue and pedestal.ï¿½ Word started spreading to both supporters and opponents of the statue, and a crowd of about 75 people gathered to watch, many staying as temperatures grew cold and rain fell. Sandra Day of Moncure got out of bed, threw on sneakers and a heavy coat and drove to Pittsboro to witness the removal of the statue that has been in the center of town since Aug. 23, 1907. The Chatham County native has attended several statue protests. ï¿½Itï¿½s an honor and a privilege to be standing here,ï¿½ said Day, who is black. ï¿½I wanted to see it for myself.ï¿½ Last week, a temporary restraining order expired, and a Superior Court judge lifted an injunction to allow the county to remove the statue from the courthouse square, The News & Observer reported. County commissioners gave County Manager Dan LaMontagne authority to take necessary action to remove it. Tuesday night cranes flanked the monument and workers with Greensboro-based Guy M. Turner Inc., began wrapping yellow straps around the likeness of the soldier to remove it. They wrapped the statue in a cage structure, and when it was removed, the cage went with it. A half-dozen monument supporters stood in the crowd, holding Confederate flags. They declined to talk to reporters. Wednesday, the county said the statue and pedestal would be stored in a warehouse in Greensboro, where Guy M. Turner Inc.ï¿½s business is located. The county said it cost about $44,000 to remove the statue and pedestal ï¿½ coming from county funds ï¿½ and will cost $300 a month to store it. It will remain there ï¿½until such time as the Winnie Davis Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) finds a more appropriate location to place them.ï¿½ Thomas Jones, who has lived in Chatham County since 2011, stopped to watch about 10:15 p.m., while returning home from the grocery store. He said he has followed the debate over Confederate statues locally and across the country and described himself as being in a ï¿½unique position.ï¿½ His great-grandmother was in the Daughters of the Confederacy, and he is a military veteran. ï¿½We as a society have to reconcile, at what point does the harm to a few outweigh the harm to many more,ï¿½ Jones said. ï¿½I donï¿½t think this is about taking down a monument to eradicate hate. Itï¿½s about taking down the pain that symbolizes these monuments. That pain exists on both sides. ... I think this will help everyone take the next step forward.ï¿½ The West Chatham Branch of the NAACP and Chatham for All have worked for years to have the statue removed. Debate has surrounded the monument and whether it was a gift to the county ï¿½ making it a public monument protected under a 2015 state law ï¿½ or a private monument owned by the Winnie Davis Chapter of the N.C. United Daughters of the Confederacy. That would allow it be removed. Superior Court judge Susan Bray said last week that the UDCï¿½s lawyers didnï¿½t prove there would be ï¿½irreparable harmï¿½ if the monument were removed, pending a decision about whether the county is allowed to do that under state law, The N&O reported. The county attorney has said the 1907 license that allowed the UDC to erect the monument can be revoked. The license does not say whether the monument is a gift but leaves it ï¿½in the care and keeping of the said Daughters of the Confederacy.ï¿½ On Aug. 19, the Chatham County commissioners voted to give the group an opportunity to come up with a plan for the statue. The deadline was Oct. 1, with a Nov. 1 deadline for the county to take action if it wasnï¿½t removed by the UDC. The debate has brought local and out-of-state statue supporters and opponents to Pittsboro every Saturday since the boardï¿½s decision. This past weekend, police arrested a dozen people after fights broke out between demonstrators. Charges included inciting a riot and simple assault. Bray scheduled a hearing for Dec. 2 to hear the countyï¿½s motion about dismissing the UDCï¿½s lawsuit. The removal of the statue Tuesday was relatively subdued, compared to the previous gatherings surrounding the statue. And it was a stark contrast to the removal of the Silent Sam Confederate statue on UNC-Chapel Hillï¿½s campus, which was toppled by protesters in August 2018. That statue also generated angry protests and debate, but university officials said the 2015 law prevented them from removing or altering it. Protesters took the matter into their own hands. A few months later, then-UNC Chancellor Carol Folt ordered the pedestal that once held the statue be removed Jan. 14 as she simultaneously announced her resignation. Crews removed it shortly after 1 a.m. Jan. 15, and the space on McCorkle Place has remained vacant since. The statue and its remains are in an undisclosed location in Chapel Hill as a committee of the UNC System Board of Governors seeks a home for it, The N&O reported in September. ï¿½The last several months have been a painful time for Chatham County,ï¿½ said Chatham County Board of Commissioners Chair Mike Dasher in a news release Wednesday morning. ï¿½Weï¿½ve experienced high emotions, division and even violence which have impacted residents, businesses and the overall feel of our community. ï¿½Whatï¿½s clear now is that the overwhelming majority of our residents are eager to move forward.ï¿½ÿ21.11.2019ÿConfederate monument at center of protests in Chatham County taken down

In Florida, for example, a sprawling recycling factory has 14 different robots that can easily distinguish bottles, cans, boxes, and many other recyclables from one another, sorting out the different materials and placing them in different areas. The robots come from AMP Robotics, a Colorado-based company that believes it can help solve the recycling crisis in America that begun two years ago after China banned imports of low-value recyclingï¿½a ban that made sense since some shipments were so poorly sorted or contaminated with the garbage that they were nearly worthless. AMPï¿½s robots can sort 80 items per minute, roughly twice as much as a human picker average, and can do the work more accurately. The software that runs the robots uses machine learning to recognize each object, getting smarter the more it does the task. For those who find it worrying that robots are taking this formally human job, take a moment to consider this: itï¿½s a job that has high turnover, particularly because itï¿½s not a job humans want to do. Plus, if these robots can help us be better at recycling, then we should definitely not shy away from putting robots to work. ÿ21.11.2019ÿThese speedy robots are helping America tackle the recycling crisis

In these transactions, the borrowerï¿½s meeting of certain social and environmental goals is incentivized through the favorable or unfavorable adjustment of interest rates. In this case, that means Pradaï¿½s interest payments on the five-year loan will be determined annually based on whether the company has hit three specific objectives.

This generates as many CO2 emissions as all the worldï¿½s cars. Strangely enough, however, the design of the fan hasnï¿½t changed in 100 years. Thatï¿½s why Jay Harmanï¿½s design firm, PAX Scientific, has designed a new, ultra-efficient fan called the Flair, that supposedly uses up to 85 percent less electricity than conventional fans of the same size. Inspired by the natural phenomenon of whirlpools, the Flair is designed like the vortex of a whirlpool in order to minimize friction and maximize airflow. This not only helps the Flair blow air more efficiently but also makes it a whole lot quieter than other fans. Considering that there are around 800 million portable fans in the world, ultra-efficient and powerful Flair fans have the potential to make a real impact on carbon emissions and save billions of dollars in energy. Currently, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to help Flair enter the market.

Thatï¿½s why a France-based startup called Carbios is taking an entirely new approach. Using a bioreactor, the startup is taking pulverized PET plastic wasteï¿½the kind of plastic found in drink bottles and polyester clothingï¿½and mixing it with water and enzymes, which are then heated up and churned. In a matter of hours, the enzymes decompose the plastic into the materialï¿½s basic building blocks, called monomers, which can then be separated, purified, and used to make new plastic thatï¿½s identical to virgin material. The technology is especially cool because it can bring new value to colored bottles, which canï¿½t be recycled into transparent plastic because current methods canï¿½t remove the dye. By working with different types of waste, the company believes that it can help increase the volume of plastic thatï¿½s recycled. Thatï¿½s critical for keeping plastic out of the environment, and itï¿½s also key at a time when manufacturersï¿½under pressure from consumers to do more about the growing plastic waste crisisï¿½have new goals to ramp up their use of recycled packaging. Needless to say, weï¿½ll be keeping a special eye out for Carbios and its special recycling technology. ÿ21.11.2019ÿFrench startup can recycle any old plastic and turn it into virgin plastic again

Electric buses zipping by? Rolling hills covered with solar panels? Offshore wind farms towering over the sea? If batteries are part of your vision, good thinking. But thereï¿½s a promising if whimsical, piece of the renewable energy puzzle that might be missing from your mental picture: the world of gravity energy storage. Generating electricity using gravity is hardly a new concept ï¿½ think of your classic hydropower plant, which captures the energy of falling water via a turbine. But some hydropower systems donï¿½t just produce energy. A ï¿½pumped-storageï¿½ hydroelectric plant draws excess energy from the grid and uses it to pump water back up into an elevated reservoir where it can fall again. But who needs water when there are all kinds of things we can slide down a mountain or drop off a cliff? Really, you can use almost any material for gravity energy storage, as long as itï¿½s heavy, cheap, and you can figure out how to transport it up and down a steep slope. In an article posted in the journal Energy last week, the authors depicted a ï¿½Mountain Gravity Energy Storageï¿½ system that involves a ski-lift-style cable that carries huge bins of sand up and down a mountain. The sand gets stored in an enormous vessel at the top, and when the grid needs extra energy, itï¿½s sent down the mountain, pulled by the force of gravity, thereby powering an electric generator. Depending on the amount of sand, the height of the mountain, and the speed of the fall, the authors estimate that it can generate electricity for anywhere from five to 555 days. Thatï¿½s incredible for such a rudimentary system and could become a simple solution for energy storage until batteries become capable of storing massive amounts of energy without degrading. And we donï¿½t even need to turn our beautiful mountains into eye-sores to make this happen. engineers are already patenting gravity storage systems on the slopes of defunct coal mines. ÿ21.11.2019ÿThe humble ski-lift could lead us to clean energy thatï¿½s available on demand

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges we face today. It is already affecting people and nature across the globe, with developing countries being most impacted. ï¿½The poorest communities are the most vulnerable to climate change. Poor farmers and others at the bottom of the pyramid suffer and lose their livelihoods even with small changes in rainfall patterns or temperatureï¿½, as Meike van Ginneken, Chief Executive Officer at SNV explained. There is an urgent need for investment to enable vulnerable communities and ecosystems to adapt to climate change. Carola van Rijnsoever, Director of Inclusive Green Growth, and Ambassador for Sustainable Development, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said ""The challenge we face to help communities adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change is enormous, and the case for action is incredibly clear. We cannot do this with governments alone. We need all stakeholders to be strong enough to confront this challenge. The set-up of this consortium in which finance and NGOs come together, is unique and uniquely positioned to do this."" The Dutch government has committed to addressing this need through the DFCD, making ï¿½160 million available in the period 2019-2022 for climate adaptation and mitigation, of which at least 50% is earmarked for climate adaptation projects. DFCD is a direct response to the increasing demand for climate adaptation projects that have to date suffered from a lack of funding compared with mitigation efforts. ï¿½In 2018, US$612 billion was invested in climate mitigation which is important and much needed. In contrast however, only 5%, USD 30 billion, was invested in adaptation. Adaptation may have to be USD 180 billion a year if the 2030 goal is to reach the USD 1.7 trillion as required according to the most recent report of the Global Commission on Adaptation,"" added Linda Broekhuizen. To help bridge this funding gap the DFCD aims to mobilize upwards of ï¿½500 million from private sector investors. Andrew Johnstone, Chief Executive Officer of Climate Fund Managers said, ï¿½The opportunities are there. Take water for example: 80% of the worldï¿½s wastewater enters rivers and oceans untreated and by 2025, half of the worldï¿½s population will be living in water stressed areas. Neither the private nor the public sector is doing enough, but together the investment potential is enormous, as is the impact to be delivered.ï¿½ This partnership of NGOs and financiers seeks to develop and finance sustainable private sector solutions to enhance resilience to the effects of climate change. These projects will boost the health of freshwater, forest, agricultural and ocean ecosystems, and improve water management. ""The consortium takes a landscape approach through investing in projects which are planned in an inclusive manner, and build on a solid understanding of the landscape, ecosystems and communities. In this way these projects will contribute to healthier ecosystems,ï¿½ said Kirsten Schuijt, Chief Executive Officer of WWF-NL. ï¿½New and incredibly exciting in this consortium is that there is early-stage funding available to convert adaptation opportunities into bankable projects.ï¿½ WWF and SNV take on the key role of developing climate-relevant projects from an early-stage idea to a bankable business case. Climate Fund Managers and FMO provide investment capital, delivering projects to full operations. This combination of early-stage involvement with full life-cycle funding will ensure lasting, long-term impact that contributes to the Paris Agreement and the United Nationï¿½s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."ÿ21.11.2019ÿDutch Fund for Climate and Development open for business

The billionaire, South Koreaï¿½s third-richest man and heir to the sprawling Samsung empire, had been accused of making large donations to foundations run by a close friend and confidante of the deposed South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, in return for political favours. The court said Lee provided bribes anticipating support from Park, who was still president at the time, according to South Koreaï¿½s Yonhap news agency. Leeï¿½s lawyers said they would appeal. ï¿½As a lawyer I cannot possibly agree with the juridical decisions and acknowledged facts involved in the verdict,ï¿½ the Samsung attorney Song Woo-cheo said outside the court. ï¿½We will appeal against the decision and I am sure that in the appellate trial all the charges will be dismissed.ï¿½ Leeï¿½s case could end up being decided by the countryï¿½s supreme court, possibly next year. Lee showed no reaction as the court found him guilty of bribery, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas, concealing profit from criminal acts and perjury. Earlier, South Korean TV followed him on his journey from a detention centre to the court. He emerged from a justice ministry bus in handcuffs, with white rope around his jacket, and carrying an envelope of documents. There was huge public pressure on the court to deliver a guilty verdict after the wide-ranging scandal swirling around Park ended in her impeachment last year and calls for South Korea to address decades of collusive ties between senior politicians and family-run conglomerates, or chaebol. While the 49-year-old, who is also known as Jay Y Lee, was spared the 12-year term demanded by prosecutors, his sentence is the longest given to any South Korean chaebol leader. Four other top Samsung executives were also convicted and received sentences of up to four years. Leeï¿½s conviction could also have consequences for Park, given that their cases are so closely linked. Park faces a possible life sentence when a ruling in her case is given later this year. More than 400 people applied for the 30 seats in the public gallery to witness what South Korean media billed as the ï¿½trial of the centuryï¿½. Outside, hundreds of riot police were deployed to prevent confrontations between critics and supporters of Lee and Park, a former dictatorï¿½s daughter who was elected South Koreanï¿½s first female president in late 2012 and took office in February 2013. Despite claims by his legal team that Lee had little involvement in the day-to-day running of Samsung, the court ruled that he had approved donations to Parkï¿½s friend, Choi Soon-sil, in return for securing government support for the contentious merger of two Samsung affiliates that would strengthen his control over the group. Since his arrest in February, Lee has insisted the payments were made to Samsung without his knowledge, and with no expectation of favours from the Park administration. Lee, the scion of South Koreaï¿½s richest family and its biggest company, had been accused of offering $38m (ï¿½30m) in bribes to four entities controlled by Choi, to whom Park often turned for advice and allegedly gave access to government documents even though she did not have security clearance. Choi is alleged to have set up the foundations to support Parkï¿½s policies. Samsung has not denied donating money to the foundations, but said it was forced to do so by Park. Samsung was also accused of separately giving Choi billions of won to fund her daughterï¿½s equestrian career in Germany. In return, Lee allegedly sought government approval for the $8bn merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 ï¿½ a move that would cement his control of the Samsung group. The merger was opposed by many shareholders, but went through after it was approved by the national pension fund, a major Samsung shareholder. The case has at the very least put on hold Leeï¿½s attempts to exert total control over the Samsung group, of which he has been the de facto head since his father suffered a heart attack in 2014. Investors are concerned that his enforced absence will create a leadership vacuum at Samsung ï¿½ which has dozens of affiliates and assets of $322bn (ï¿½250bn) ï¿½ and harm its ability to make key strategic decisions. Samsung has not publicly reacted to Fridayï¿½s ruling, but employees at the firm were reportedly ï¿½dumbfoundedï¿½ and concerned for its future. ï¿½We were taken aback when he was arrested in February,ï¿½ one Samsung insider told Yonhap. ï¿½But his conviction has come as a bigger shock. The company has been in emergency mode due to the leadership vacuum. And Leeï¿½s conviction means the emergency situation will continue for a long time.ï¿½ Other business figures to have stood trial in South Korea have traditionally received light sentences, fueling criticism that chaebol leaders are treated with unwarranted leniency by the courts. They included Leeï¿½s father, Lee Kun-hee, who was convicted of tax evasion in 2009 and had a three-year sentence suspended, with judges citing his contribution to South Koreaï¿½s economic success and his ï¿½patriotism through business enterprise from job creationï¿½. He was pardoned four months after the final ruling. Park Sangin, a professor of economics at Seoul National University, said shortly before the verdict: ï¿½Chaebol leaders used to get the same sentencing every time. There was even a saying called the ï¿½3-5 lawï¿½ ï¿½ three years sentencing, five yearsï¿½ probation. ï¿½If Lee receives a heavy sentence, it can be seen as the shattering of the ï¿½too-big-to-jailï¿½ trend of the past.ï¿½ South Koreaï¿½s new president, Moon Jae-in, won a landslide victory in May pledging to rein in the chaebol and clamp down on white-collar crime involving corporate tycoons. ÿ21.11.2019ÿSamsung heir sentenced to five years in jail after corruption conviction

In each block there is a makeshift kitchen, a small, grubby toilet and three rooms crowded with bunk beds. There is no air conditioning to break the oppressively humid air. Outside, burning rubbish sends acrid fumes through the labour camp, which is strewn with broken furniture and an abandoned vehicle. To call it a slum would be generous. Iï¿½ve seen some truly appalling workersï¿½ camps in Malaysia and the Gulf, but this rivalled the worst. Every day, the men who live here work on factory lines making components used by Samsung Electronics, one of the biggest electronics companies in the world. Last year, Samsung made a profit of almost $50bn (ï¿½38bn). In Malaysia that money is made largely by the hands of cheap foreign migrant labour ï¿½ millions of workers drawn from the regionï¿½s poorest countries. Malaysia, where forced labour ï¿½ a form of modern slavery ï¿½ is commonplace, has a reputation for the flagrant abuse of workers rights. But that hasnï¿½t stopped Samsung, and dozens of other leading electronics companies, from setting up shop here. Unlike its competitors, most of Samsungï¿½s products are assembled in-house, but it uses a long chain of suppliers to provide it with parts, services and labour, including foreign migrant workers. I walked around the camp, stunned. Why must men who are part of the supply chain of one of the worldï¿½s biggest electronics companies live in such squalor and be treated so poorly? What was so frustrating was that Iï¿½d seen it all before. Two years ago, I travelled to Malaysia to investigate the treatment of these foreign migrants working at Samsung. Men employed by a sub-contractor, but working on the assembly line of Samsungï¿½s microwave oven plant, told me that their passports had been confiscated, that they were being paid less than promised, and that they were deep in debt after shelling out high fees to recruitment agents in their home country. Despite working at seemingly normal factories, these men were effectively trapped in their jobs by debt bondage and felt unable to leave even though they knew they were being exploited. Samsungï¿½s response was quick. They fired the sub-contractor and announced improved guidelines for the recruitment and treatment of foreign migrant workers. The guidelines, which apply to Samsung worksites and its suppliers, state migrant workers should pay no recruitment fees, receive the minimum wage and retain their passports. Samsung said: ï¿½We will be strictly applying and implementing these guidelines across our global operations as well as among our suppliers.ï¿½ In September, I returned to see if they had lived up to their promises. At first, there were some positive signs. Workers at the microwave plant told me the factory was safe, the food was good and they liked the games room in their hostel. Some said they were only being paid a basic salary of about a pound an hour, but they seemed satisfied. Most importantly, those recruited directly by Samsung since 2016 said they had not paid any recruitment fees. Although it was encouraging to see that changes had been made at this one plant, I wanted to see if the same applied for workers further down the supply chain. Samsung certainly appeared to have made sure that conditions for the men it directly employed and were legally responsible for had improved, but what about the many others also working at this factory, who were instead hired through sub-contracting companies? According to its own guidelines, and international labour standards, Samsung is responsible for their welfare too. So I went back to the factory and followed a group of men heading home on foot at the end of their shift. Dozens of pairs of shoes crowded the entrance to a couple of flats in a rundown apartment block, within sight of the Samsung plant. The flats were home to 21 men from Bangladesh. All had been hired by a company that supplied workers, through another company, to Samsung. They told a very different story. They said they paid vast sums to come to Malaysia, some as high as ï¿½3,500 ï¿½ more than three times the annual per capita income in Bangladesh ï¿½ but were earning less than promised. Aminul (not his real name) said it would take him about two years just to pay back the loan he took to afford the recruitment fee. ï¿½Itï¿½s a huge pressure for me to pay back the debt ï¿½ When I got here, I realised I made a mistake.ï¿½ But like all the men, Aminul says he cannot leave. ï¿½My employer has my passport, so if I want to go back home, I canï¿½t,ï¿½ he said. Another group of men, working as cleaners at the same Samsung plant, claimed the company that directly employs them was illegally deducting almost a fifth of their basic salary each month, meaning they were earning far below the minimum wage. Even at Samsungï¿½s flagship plant in Malaysia, which produces batteries for its bestselling mobile phones, Samsung continues to use sub-contracted workers who have paid high recruitment fees. ï¿½They didnï¿½t ask us how much we paid to come here ï¿½ so thereï¿½s no question of us being repaid,ï¿½ one worker told me. What was striking was how afraid everyone appeared. They worried that if they spoke to me they would be deported or punished. One worker, referring to his direct employer, told me: ï¿½If they know I gave you an interview, they will take me to some place and beat me up.ï¿½ When I put my findings to Samsung, they responded with a statement: ï¿½We will conduct thorough investigation on this matter that you have shared with us. As a committed member of the global community, Samsung will continue our efforts to both respect and protect human rights of the migrant workers.ï¿½ While an investigation is of course welcomed, Samsung could have easily found this out for themselves if theyï¿½d really wanted to. I had a small budget, a couple of assistants and no official access and yet, within a few days, I had uncovered a raft of abuses that strongly suggest forced labour continues among workers employed by some companies supplying labour, parts or services to Samsung. What I found on my brief journey down this tiny part of Samsungï¿½s electronics supply chain in Malaysia remains an everyday reality for the millions of migrant workers across the world who toil daily to make the gadgets we use to make our own lives easier and more enjoyable. This is what is looks like when companies are left to police their own supply chains. when mega-companies chase profit, with insufficient concern for a workforce that case has no means of comeback. What I found in that labour camp is not an inevitability. It is a choice that companies are making. And we all have to bear some responsibility when we look the other way. Samsung used to have a brand campaign with the slogan: ï¿½With Samsung, itï¿½s not that hard to imagine.ï¿½ What Iï¿½d like to do is ask Samsung and all the companies around the world who rely on the sweat and toil of a migrant workforce to imagine that everyone in their supply chain is their responsibility. Imagine recruiting them directly, not through agents, and at zero cost. Imagine auditing your whole supply chain regularly and rigorously. Imagine paying everyone a decent wage. And then make it a reality. ÿ21.11.2019ÿSamsung should try imagining a world where big firms respect workers

Roundup contains the chemical glyphosate, which the World Health Organization described in 2015 as a ""probable carcinogen."" Costco will reportedly stop selling Roundup, and a petition is currently calling on other big retailers to do the same. A federal jury awarded a California man $80 million on Wednesday after finding that Roundup, a Monsanto-made weedkiller, played a role in causing his cancer. It was a major blow for Monsanto, which faces thousands of lawsuits from non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients who used Roundup and later developed cancer. It's the second time a jury has issued a multimillion-dollar verdict against Monsanto in a Roundup-related case. Now, Costco has reportedly decided to begin to stop selling the popular weedkiller, which contains glyphosate ï¿½ an herbicide which the World Health Organization described in 2015 as a probable carcinogen. Moms Across America founder Zen Honeycutt, whose petition calling for Costco to stop selling Roundup has more than 150,000 signatures on Change.org, wrote on her website: ""I called the headquarters, and after two days of messages and calls, I did finally confirm with three people that Costco was not ordering Roundup or any glyphosate-based herbicides for the incoming spring shipments."" Costco has yet to issue an official statement on the petition. However, in conversations with the administrative staff at various stores, Big Think has learned that the product was pulled off the floor this week per corporate orders ï¿½ meaning, Costco's removal of Roundup applies to ""all locations."" Meanwhile, Moms Across America has another petition on Change.org calling on Home Depot and Lowe's to pull the product from their shelves: ""We call on Home Depot and Lowe's today to step up as Costco has to protect us, your customers, and stop selling Roundup (and all glyphosate herbicides) now, due to its carcinogenic effects and lack of labeling,"" the petition reads. ""Everyone deserves to know! These products should not be sold to the public!"" But in the wake of Wednesday's verdict, Bayer, the pharmaceutical giant that owns Monsanto, maintains that glyphosate is safe and plans to ""vigorously defend"" its product and appeal Wednesday's verdict, according to Bloomberg. Both farmers and ordinary consumers use Roundup. If only residential consumers stop using the weedkiller, it likely won't have a big impact on the company's bottom line. ""That's a small fraction of the legacy Monsanto business, so that won't have a significant impact on the results,"" chemicals analyst Christopher Perrella told Bloomberg. ""But it certainly is having a big impact on the market cap of Bayer."" However, it's not immediately clear how much Monsanto would lose if big retailers such as Costco continue to stop buying Roundup. Currently, the signature asking for Lowe's and Home Depot to drop the product has about 90,000 signatures. "ÿ25.11.2019ÿCostco stops selling controversial Roundup weedkiller

South Korea, the worldï¿½s fourth-largest coal importer, is making a concerted effort to shift to green energy after public pressure to do so and aims to generate 35% of its electricity from renewables by 2040. South Korea is Asiaï¿½s fourth-largest economy, and it currently relies on nuclear, gas, and coal for power. The government had originally planned to retrofit 20 of its 60 coal plants with anti-pollution gear when they reached 30 years of age, but this idea has been abandoned, as itï¿½s not cost-effective. According to a June Reuters article: ï¿½To have more renewable power, we can make coal power plants run lower,ï¿½ said Kang Seung-jin, energy professor at Korea Polytechnic University, who is helping to map out the 2019 plan. According to the World Economic Forum: The World Economic Forumï¿½s Energy Transition Index, which benchmarks countriesï¿½ energy systems and supports them as they move to cleaner power sources, ranks South Korea 48th out of 115 nations surveyed. Its capital wants to lead the transition. In November 2017, the capital cityï¿½s government announced the 2022 Solar City Seoul Plan, in which it said it would add 1 GW of solar capacity by 2022. This has already cut more than 100 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Every public building in Seoul will be fitted with solar by 2022, and one-quarter of the cityï¿½s residences will get solar panels in an attempt to further reduce CO2 emissions by more than a half-million metric tons. There is a solar-panel rental scheme in place for residents, which is proving popular. The cityï¿½s baseball stadium is covered with solar panels, and Gwanghwamun Square will become a solar street in January 2020, featuring solar panels on lights, benches, and trash cans. The city hopes that its solar initiative will even attract tourists.

The commitment builds on CCA's recent elimination of plastic straws and stirrers across its Australian market The commitment will see CCA, which is the largest soft drinks bottler in Australia, incorporate more than 10,000 tonnes of pre and post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics in its range of bottles annually by 2020. This move will enable the company to produce all bottles with a capacity of 600ml or less using 100% recycled plastic, while also doubling the proportion of recycled content in all other bottle ranges. Selected lines in the firmï¿½s 600ml and under range, which includes on-the-go bottles for the likes of Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola and Mount Franklin, will be launched in 100% recycled bottles by the end of 2019. Overall, the move will see recycled material account for more than two-thirds of CCAï¿½s plastic packaging content. Australiaï¿½s federal government recently implemented a National Packaging Target framework, encouraging all large companies to incorporate at least 70% recycled content in their plastic packaging by 2025. According to CCAï¿½s managing director Peter West, the companyï¿½s new commitments mean it is likely to surpass this requirement ahead of schedule. ï¿½Weï¿½ve heard the community message loud and clear ï¿½ that unnecessary packaging is unacceptable, and that we need to do our part to reduce it nationwide,ï¿½ West said. ï¿½This is the single largest increase in recycled plastic use in our history and our strongest step forward in reducing packaging waste and the environmental impact of our operations.ï¿½ The move from CCA builds on its existing framework of 2025 sustainability targets, which saw the company eliminate single-use plastic straws and stirrers from its Australian market. It also comes shortly after rival firm PepsiCo announced plans to launch bottles made using 100% recycled plastic content by 2020, after partnering with plastics innovation firm Loop Industries to source greater quantities of PCR plastic. A mixed plastics picture CCAï¿½s new pledge comes as The Coca-Cola Company ï¿½ its parent firm, which holds a minority stake in the business ï¿½ is aiming to make all bottles globally with an average of 50% recycled content by 2030, up from its 2017 proportion of 7%. However, several of the companyï¿½s largest market arms and bottlers, including Coca-Cola UK and Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP), have set more ambitious targets, with these two bodies targeting 50% by 2020 and 2025 respectively. According to CCEPï¿½s recent integrated annual report, the company is on track to meet its recycled content aim after signing a deal with Loop Industries to secure a continuous and secure flow of high-grade recycled PET (rPET). While the green economy has, broadly, reacted well to The Coca-Cola Companyï¿½s efforts to reduce its virgin plastics footprint, anger was recently directed at the firm by green campaigners after it disclosed its total plastic footprint for the first time, revealing that it used three million tonnes in its global operations 2018. This figure accounts for both virgin and recycled plastics. The information was disclosed through the Ellen MacArthur Foundationï¿½s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment spring 2019 report, which also documented the plastic use of 34 other firms including Colgate Palmolive, SC Johnson and Unilever. It revealed that The Coca-Cola Company was the largest user of plastic during 2018 out of the companies surveyed, using almost double that of the next firm on the list, Nestle. Green campaign groups such as Greenpeace were quick to argue that the company should be ashamed of the figure, with some calculating that its annual plastic use is equivalent to around 108 billion bottles per year, or one-fifth of the worldï¿½s total annual single-use plastic bottle output. The Ellen MacArthur Foundationï¿½s New Plastics Economy lead Sander Defruyt, however, has argued that disclosure is the first step towards driving positive change. ï¿½We applaud the companies that are publishing this data and encourage all other companies that make and use plastics to follow their lead,ï¿½ Defruyt said. ï¿½This is an important step forward to create transparency.ï¿½ Similarly, Coca-Cola's new European sustainability director Therese Noorlander recently told edie that disclosure on plastic use is essential for any company wishing to regain consumer trust as the war on plastics continues to gather pace and fake news continues to spread. ÿ25.11.2019ÿAustralia's largest Coca-Cola bottler to launch 100% recycled plastic bottles this year

She finally landed on a type of algae that can be locally sourced. The material can be used to replace oil-based plastic in packaging such as bags or the translucent windows used to show products in boxes. As her research continues, Hughes says that sheï¿½ll be studying how MarinaTex works as a barrier and how long it could be used to store food. Unlike some ï¿½compostableï¿½ plastics, which need to be processed in an industrial composting facility to break down, the new material can break down in four to six weeks in a backyard compost bin. ï¿½All the ingredients are food-grade safe,ï¿½ Hughes says. ï¿½So this degrades much like a piece of food would degrade.ï¿½ If it accidentally washed into the ocean and a turtle or fish ate it, it wouldnï¿½t cause problems. ï¿½Iï¿½ve yet to work out the nutritional value for fish,ï¿½ she says. ï¿½But the core ingredients are proteins from fish and algae, so thatï¿½s already kind of the diet of a fish anyway.ï¿½ The research is at an early stage, but Hughes has calculated that the material could be cost-competitive because it can be processed at low temperatures, saving energy compared to plastic production, and because it starts with waste products rather than oil.

After the fabric wears out and it develops a couple of holes, its owner will throw it in the trash. The garment will then sit in a landfill, where the organic fibers will biodegrade and the synthetic ones will just degrade into tiny particles, never fully decomposing. Patagonia is trying to make the afterlife of its garments more exciting: When a customer begins to spot wear and tear on a puffer jacket or fleece vest, they can bring it back to a Patagonia store to have it repaired. If they donï¿½t use the item much anymore, they can give it back to Patagonia, which will refurbish it and sell it on Worn Wear, a marketplace of second-hand products that launched in 2017. But what about pieces that are truly beyond repair? Those are the clothes Patagonia is focusing on with the launch of a new line called ReCrafted. The line takes worn-out, damaged goods and transforms them into entirely new, one-of-a-kind products at a workshop in Los Angeles. Each item in the ReCrafted collection is made up of between three and six pieces of used clothing. ï¿½The ReCrafted line was an answer to a question,ï¿½ says Kourtney Morgan, Patagoniaï¿½s senior designer, in a video to launch the line. ï¿½And the question was: What are we doing with all the products we are taking back that isnï¿½t recyclable, that isnï¿½t resale-able, and that isnï¿½t repairable?ï¿½ The first series of items consists of down jackets and vests, a sweater, a T-shirt, a toolkit, and four bags, all available on Patagoniaï¿½s Worn Wear website for prices that range from $27 to $327. The aesthetic, unsurprisingly, feels different from the traditional Patagonia line: They feature a kind of bricolage effect, with fabrics of different colors and textures stitched together. This is just the latest part of Patagoniaï¿½s broader strategy of keeping garments in circulation for longer. When it comes to the fashion industry, the bulk of carbon emissions happens early in the supply chain, in the production of raw materials and manufacturing in factories. The longer an item is used, the lower its environmental footprint. Many companies are now trying to extend the lifespan of a garment by ensuring it lives on in a secondary market. Platforms such as ThredUp and PoshMark allow consumers to sell their products to other people. Brands like Patagonia, Eileen Fisher, Arcteryx, and Taylor Stitch have their own marketplaces for secondhand goods, all of which are powered by a company called Yerdle, which helps brands create resale sites. But for goods that simply cannot be resold or repaired, programs such as ReCrafted can help these items live on a little longer. Patagonia isnï¿½t the only brand doing this. Eileen Fisher has a similar program, called ReNew, that takes back old clothes and turns them into new pieces. The ReCrafted products are available starting today on the Worn Wear website, along with Patagoniaï¿½s first dedicated Worn Wear pop-up, which opens tomorrow in Boulder, Coloradoï¿½along with a repair workshop on-site. Will such projects inspire other brands to launch similar programs? Itï¿½s hard to say. It takes a relatively large company, with plenty of resources, to redirect worn-out clothes and bring on designers to create new pieces. This may prove too much of a hurdle for many brands. ÿ25.11.2019ÿPatagoniaï¿½s new line is made from old clothes damaged beyond repair

To describe their approach to meeting that goal, the term they use is ï¿½circularity.ï¿½ This is the idea that what is often considered waste can actually be a resource: new products should be constructed from materials that can someday be used to manufacture other new products. If IKEA can design all its new products that way, it will cut down on the need for raw resources and be a huge step toward its goal of being a fully circular business by 2030. Circularity is sometimes talked about interchangeably with recycling, and recycling is certainly a huge element of it: the company is constantly trying to make more items like the ODGER chair, which gets at least 85 per cent of its raw material from renewable wood and recycled plastic. But recycling is an act. circularity is a mindset. It means thinking right from the beginning about how to make products fully circular, and building that into the design. To make that happen, everyone must always be exploring new possibilities for old material, and sometimes completely rethinking it, transforming it. One way of doing that is to find shapes, forms and styles that are totally different from the original material. Take for example the KUNGSBACKA kitchen door ï¿½ the end product of an attempt to create a completely circular item, where all the material is recycled. The IKEA development team found that in addition to using old wood scraps for the main material of the door, they could use approximately 25 recycled plastic water bottles to create a black matte finish that covers the entire surface. The result is very environmentally friendly, since those 25 bottles have been turned into something that can last 25 years or more and get recycled again at the end of that period. (Compare that to the 70 billion plastic bottles a year that are just thrown in the trash, where they may not break down for 1,000 years.) But the door is also unrecognizably different from the source material. Without being told, no one could guess that the matte finish was made out of water bottles, since it is different in shape, texture, colour and everything else. Circular thinking helped the creators see hidden possibilities in an old bottle. Another thing that circularity makes possible is a more creative, artistic approach to home furnishings. When IKEA came up with the idea of taking leftover bed linen fabric and turning it into the Tï¿½NUM rug, it was obvious that this would never work if the finished product looked like ï¿½leftovers.ï¿½ So the creators took inspiration from an older type of Swedish handcrafted product known as the ï¿½rag rug,ï¿½ which relies on weaving together small, differently coloured pieces of fabric into a unique pattern. The Tï¿½NUM rug is an IKEA product that almost seems to come from an earlier time ï¿½ not just in look and feel, but the way itï¿½s made. The method of creating it is modern in one important facet: the weaving centres had to be organized in an environmentally and socially responsible way. But the weaving is done by hand, and while each rug uses a similar approach to combining different colours, each one is distinct. By thinking harder and deeper about what to do with used fabric, IKEA managed to create a circular product that rejuvenates not only materials, but also time-honoured manufacturing processes. These unique designs would never have happened if IKEA had taken a one-size-fits-all approach to its products. Because they needed to find ways to incorporate recycled and renewable material, IKEAï¿½s designers were inspired to come up with items that look and feel unique, as the KUNGSBACKA and Tï¿½NUM do in their different ways. Circular thinking can be a challenge, but challenges often lead to the best work. Most companies still adhere to a linear model for resource use: they find the material, make the product out of it, and it gets thrown away when itï¿½s old. Apart from being environmentally unsustainable, that approach can also lead to a mindset of standardization, where the only things getting recycled are the designs. With circularity, a company is free to take risks, to experiment. IKEAï¿½s adoption of circular thinking is grounded in its commitment to positive change for the environment and for people, but it is also discovering other benefits ï¿½ in the form of unleashed creativity and higher-quality, more innovative products.

Desserto has found a way to create organic and cruelty-free leather that is both durable and beautiful. This innovation is the first of its kind and has the potential to transform the leather industry and put it on the path to sustainability. Partners Adriï¿½n Lï¿½pez Velarde and Marte Cï¿½zarez first debuted their pioneering brand, Desserto, at the International Leather Fair Lineapelle roughly one month ago. The launch of their product has caused a buzz and made many sustainable junkies, prick up their ears with interest. The leather produced from their Mexico-based cactus farms is not only sustainable but also partially biodegradable, durable yet soft and high quality. While it is currently being used for mostly for luggage, the material has the potential to be used in other clothing products, accessories and even car interiors in future. The final product produced from the nopal cactus is the result of over two years of research, development and close attention to details. The cactus leather is on standard with the current specifications required for industries that use animal and synthetic leather as well. The idea for Desserto was born when the founders became aware of the plastic pollution crisis. The nopal cactus was chosen for its abundance in Mexico as well as the fact that it needs no water to grow. The nopal cactus is commonly used to feed livestock and is often added to a variety of dishes. Locals may know the nopal by its more casual name the ï¿½prickly pear cactusï¿½. The Desserto brand does not plan to make products from the material themselves but rather sell it to fashion brands and designers to promote sustainable alternatives to leather. Many vegan leather products out there contain synthetic materials that consist of toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A and phthalates. The most common materials used are polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyurethane (PU) and while they are technically cruelty-free and more sustainable than the real leather alternative, they are not biodegradable and often end up in landfills and even negatively effecting wildlife in the long term. This is still better than ï¿½real leatherï¿½, however, as raising livestock for leather production is costly and consumes a huge quantity of resources as well as pollutes the air and soil. After the tanning process the materials made from natural products become impossible to biodegrade due to exposure to harmful chemicals such as formaldehyde and chromium. The Desserto brand is expected to be worth billions of dollars by 2025 and could revolutionise the way we see leather for good. ÿ25.11.2019ÿSucculently sustainable cactus leather hits the market

Customers would see the seed variety and planting instructions printed on the cup. It might sound like a lot of work for consumers drinking coffee on the go, but if they werenï¿½t up to the task themselves, they could toss it in a special receptacle at the coffee shop where they would be picked up by the manufacturers and planted in one of three California nature reserves. Traditional coffee cups, lines with polyethylene, take up to 50 years to decompose. These cups, designed by the startup Reduce. Reuse.Grow. are lined with a plant-based plastic called PLA, which decomposes in 3-6 months. The seeds are embedded in the paper portion of the cup. The cups would cost 2 cents each instead of a penny each, which does t sound like much , but adds up when youï¿½re selling 4 billion a year (ahemï¿½ Starbucks), Forbes points out. But perhaps with a little consumer pressure, the coffee giant will keep the promise it made years ago to come up with biodegradable cups. ÿ25.11.2019ÿCoffee Cups Embedded with Seeds Grow Into Trees and Wildflowers

The 100MW/129MWh battery was switched on in November and is paired with the Hornsdale windfarm, about 230km north of Adelaide. The French renewable energy company Neoen, which owns the battery, filed for IPO listing on the French stock exchange this month. A 400-page document filed in support of the application shows the battery, which is the largest lithium-ion battery in the world, had a capital cost of ï¿½56m or A$90.6m and generated ï¿½8.1m, or A$13.1m, in revenue from network services in the six months to 30 June 2018. Almost $2m of that was from its 10-year contract with the SA government to provide reserve capacity for the stateï¿½s electricity network, which is worth $4m a year. The rest was from trading on the frequency and ancillary services market. It also made ï¿½6.7m, or A$10.8, from the sale of stored electricity. The document does not state the projectï¿½s profit margins. The SA government contract is for 70MW of capacity and a small amount of storage, leaving 30MW and the bulk of the batteryï¿½s storage capacity available to sell on the national energy market. Dylan McConnell, from the Australian-German Climate and Energy College, said the financial returns were above the already high expectations for the project, but as more battery projects came online the rate of revenue growth could be expected to slow. ï¿½Thereï¿½s a finite need for these ancillary services,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½They are very important resources but itï¿½s quite a small market in the scheme of things.ï¿½ Neoen has several storage projects under way, including a 20MW battery attached to the proposed 194MW windfarm at the Bulgana green power hub in Victoria, 90% of which is contracted to the Victorian government. It is also proposing a 50MW storage facility in Kaban, in Queensland. The company said its success in partnering with Tesla to deliver the Hornsdale battery within 100 days of the contracts being signed ï¿½ a promise made by Tesla founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, in a twitter exchange in March 2017 ï¿½ had helped it win other contracts. Australia is the largest market in terms of megawatt storage for the ï¿½2bn (A$3.2bn) company, which is attempting to raise ï¿½450m (A$728.3m) in capital through its IPO offer to increase its capacity from 2GW to 5GW. ÿ25.11.2019ÿSouth Australia's Tesla battery on track to make back a third of cost in a year

For most, itï¿½s a combination of what the workplace offers, in terms of opportunities to make an impact, grow professionally, interact in a positive environment and take pride in a companyï¿½s mission. Good pay and benefits help, too. To dig into whoï¿½s doing it well, Comparably set out to find at which companies employees are happiest. The career site analyzed its database of 10 million employee-submitted ratings across 50,000 U.S. companies to determine which companies provided the best overall experience for their workers, based on how employees responded to questions about compensation, work-life balance, perks and benefits and overall culture. A sample of questions include: Are your companyï¿½s goals clear and are you invested in them? On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to recommend your company to a friend? Are you proud to be a part of your company? Are you typically excited about going to work each day? Do you look forward to interacting with your coworkers? Taking the No. 1 spot on the list is Zoom, a San Jose, California-based video communications company. Zoomï¿½s recognition as the company with the happiest employees is perhaps unsurprising, considering how the company was started. Zoomï¿½s founder, Eric Yuan, left a six-figure job because he wasnï¿½t happy ï¿½ and following his heart made him a billionaire. Yuan previously worked his way up from an engineering job with WebEx, a videoconferencing software company that later sold to Cisco, to become the president of engineering, where he earned a salary in the ï¿½very high six-figures.ï¿½ However, ï¿½Every day, when I woke up, I was not very happy. I even did not want to go to the office to work,ï¿½ Yuan told CNBC Make It. Yuan founded Zoom in 2011, and it now employs more than 1,700 people. It doubled its revenue in 2018 to more than $330 million and launched its IPO in April. Zoom also made Comparablyï¿½s top 10 companies with the best compensation. Yuan and the companyï¿½s top-down approach to providing a good work environment hasnï¿½t gone unnoticed. ï¿½The leadership team is intelligent, empathetic and caring,ï¿½ one employee reviewer wrote. ï¿½They understand the importance of excelling professionally but care just as much about our personal life happiness. These attributes result in a unified happy culture which yields positive business outcomes and success for employees.ï¿½ÿ25.11.2019ÿThe happiest employees in the US work at these 10 companies

Next door, in a plain grey industrial building, a Swiss SME was busily making a feed additive for dairy cows. Agolin Ruminant The compound, Agolin Ruminant, increases cowsï¿½ milk yield while reducing the amount of methane they release into the air. ï¿½Itï¿½s a digestive enhancer that enables the cow to make better use of the feed it ingests,ï¿½ said Agolinï¿½s CEO, Kurt Schaller. After working for 20 years in the feed additive industry, he co-founded the company in 2006 with animal nutritionist Beatrice Zweifel and investor Pierre-Henri Jacquet. Their flagship product is a natural blend of cloves, wild carrot and coriander oil extract. Based in Biï¿½re, a small village 40 km from Geneva, the company sells Agolin Ruminant around the world. Its primary market is Europe, where they supply it to around one million cows. This year, both the Solar Impulse Foundation and the Carbon Trust have recognized Agolin for its efforts to improve sustainability and mitigate climate change. Greenhouse gases According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), dairy and beef cattle release nearly 10 percent of human-induced greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. ï¿½Every ruminant produces methane through the fiber fermentation in digestion,ï¿½ explained Florian Leiber, head of Livestock Sciences at the Swiss Research Institute of Organic Agriculture. A single cow can release more than 100 kg of methane per year, mostly through belchingï¿½thatï¿½s roughly equivalent to two tonnes of CO 2 , or two round-trip flights between Paris and New York. While experts agree that the most effective solution to this environmental issue would be to reduce our consumption of livestock products, hundreds of millions of people around the planet still rely on such products for their food or livelihood. And with populations soaring, their demand is expected to rise by 70 percent in the next three decades. ï¿½That is why we werenï¿½t looking for a methane reduction effect at first,ï¿½ said Zweifel, ï¿½but rather a way to improve dairy cowsï¿½ milk yield with the same amount of feed intake.ï¿½ The companyï¿½s initial goal was to enhance feed efficiency by using active substances from plants and essential oils, traditional know-how that has been largely replaced by antibiotics and chemicals. Agolinï¿½s research trialsï¿½conducted independently by the Institute for Agriculture and Fisheries Research in Belgium, Aberystwyth University in Wales, the French National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRA) and the University of Californiaï¿½showed that their mixture had a considerable effect on rumen bacteria, which help cows to digest. It improved the animalï¿½s milk yield by up to seven percent. At the same time, it reduced enteric methane production by an average of 10 percent (results can vary with feeding systems). Other feed additives can reduce cattleï¿½s methane emissions, but few of them are 100 percent natural. One option, linseed oil, needs to be ï¿½used at a much higher dosage,ï¿½ said Zweifel, noting that adding Agolin Ruminant to a cowï¿½s diet costs around four cents per day, increasing farmersï¿½ incomes in a climate-friendly manner. Agolin was originally financed with its foundersï¿½ personal savings and an economic development loan from the Swiss government. Conducting research trials is a slow process, so it took three years for the company to break even, and three more to become profitable. Today, Agolin has more than 100 industrial clients worldwide and a network of 25 distributors. Chris Miller, technical manager at Gain Animal Nutrition, Irelandï¿½s largest feed brand, said that adding the compound to its product has improved his clientsï¿½ milk production by up to two liters per cow per day. The companyï¿½s turnover was nearly $10 million in 2017. ï¿½That is roughly 250,000 tonnes of C0 2 -equivalent saved each year,ï¿½ said Schaller. ï¿½If we managed to feed every cow in the world with this, the potential for CO 2 -equivalent mitigation could rise to 300 million tonnes per year.ï¿½ However, the productï¿½s scope remains limited by the fact that it can only be used in intensive farming, since it must be mixed into compound feeds and minerals, rather than fed directly to cows. ï¿½Itï¿½s virtually impossible to reach a massive-scale use of additives because the vast majority of ruminants do not have access to this kind of feed every day,ï¿½ explained Diego Morgavi, senior researcher at INRAï¿½s department of animal physiology and livestock systems. In extensive farming, which uses traditional methods, cattle feed mostly on grass. Since 2014, Agolin has been working on a project called RuMeClean, hoping to include Agolin Ruminant in the European Unionï¿½s private and public carbon offset programs. But while legislation could increase Agolinï¿½s reach, its CEO believes that private companies will lead the way in creating a more sustainable livestock industry. ï¿½Thereï¿½s a big gap between the worldï¿½s governmentsï¿½ environmental ambitions and their actions,ï¿½ Schaller noted. ï¿½Industry is much faster, and will be the first to move forward.ï¿½ ÿ25.11.2019ÿA Swiss remedy for those deadly bovine burps

For decades, business has been all about maximising profits and keeping owners happy. Now, thousands of companies and organisations are experimenting with broader values ï¿½ purpose over profit, staff and communities ahead of shareholders ï¿½ in order to meet the mood of the times. Driving this shift in consciousness is a phalanx of upstart, sustainable businesses. They cluster under different groupings ï¿½ Conscious Capitalism, B Corp, The B Team, Just Capital ï¿½ but all share the same central objective: to reshape capitalism for an environmentally endangered age. The best of these boast laudable motivations. In the past, if you wanted to change the world, you went into politics or joined a campaign group. Given the shift of power and resources to the private sector over recent decades, the smart money is increasingly on business to deliver solutions. Not business as usual, that is. Plastering products with eco labels or providing perks to employees will make not a jot of difference if, behind the scenes, companies are still happily burning fossil fuels and browbeating suppliers. ï¿½If businesses really want to be part of this movement for change, then great. But that change has to be radical and transformational. If not, itï¿½s empty words and spin,ï¿½ says Katie Hill, a spokesperson for the ethical certification body B Corp, which now counts over 3,100 registered members in over 70 countries. For a flavour of the changemaking businesses, she points to B Corpsï¿½ latest Best for the World list. The selection includes a US bank that specialises in financing community-based enterprises, a locally owned windfarm in Australia and a zero-waste Argentinian restaurant chain. (Guardian Media Group, which owns the Guardian and the Observer, recently announced that it too had been certified as a B corp). To date, founder-led businesses, cooperatives and employee-owned firms have tended to dominate such listings. Most are small, which makes sense. The larger the organisation, the harder it is to keep its mission clear and its values consistent. Small may be beautiful in ethical terms, but itï¿½s not ideal for effecting large-scale change. If endemic poverty is ever to be reversed or global heating resolved, then big business also needs to embrace this more inclusive approach to business. There are signs of that happening. Natura, the huge Brazilian cosmetic brand, and its subsidiary The Body Shop, for example, now feature among a growing roster of multinational B Corps. The purpose-led business agenda received a shot in the arm this summer when the Business Roundtable, a grouping of some 200 top US companies like Amazon, Apple and GM, committed to ï¿½lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholdersï¿½. Even the financial markets are beginning to prick up their ears. Take the rapid rise of the sustainable debt market, which has now passed the $1tn mark. Only last month, beverage giant PepsiCo issued a $1bn ï¿½greenï¿½ bond to fund environmental programmes ï¿½ a move unthinkable just a few year ago. ï¿½If the old economy makes a change, then thatï¿½s how you change the world,ï¿½ said Dutch sustainable business expert Roeland Dikker Hupkes. Of course, the buy-in of big business comes with risks. Greenwashing is perhaps the most obvious, but some practices are more subtle. After the Fairtrade organic chocolate brand Green & Blackï¿½s was taken over by food giant Kraft, for example, it started to produce confectionary that was neither organic nor Fairtrade-certified. Corporations are aware of a growing clamour, from consumers, employees, regulators, and even some investors, for business to demonstrate a social purpose beyond profitmaking. But can leopards change their spots? Most of the frontrunners in the ï¿½purpose economyï¿½ were set up to solve a specific social or environmental problem. Only then did they go about putting together a business to deliver it ï¿½ not vice versa. In that sense, itï¿½s a question few of them have had to ask. Take Fairphone. Located in Amsterdam, this hyper-ethical phone manufacturer insists on only using metals and other materials that are sustainably sourced and can be traced back to their origin. Itï¿½s a commitment that grew out of the firmï¿½s origins as a campaign group against abuses in the telecoms supply chain. ï¿½Back then, we decided that we were not really creating any alternatives, so instead we should become part of the industry ourselves,ï¿½ explains Eva Gouwens, the chief executive of the maverick phone brand. Yet retrofitting a traditional profit-maximising company is a different story altogether. The Belgian materials firm Umicore offers a very rare example of success. Once a dirty, old-school smelting firm, it has reinvented itself over the last decade or so into a pioneering recycler of waste metals. With ever lower margins in the smelting business, Umicoreï¿½s motivation was as much economic as it was environmental. The same cold logic enjoys growing traction in other old-school industries, from energy firms facing peak oil to carmakers confronting ever stricter eco standards. Also pushing companies to transform is a growing awareness among individual business leaders about the destructive route down which shareholder capitalism has pushed the planet. As Douglas Lamont, head of the UK beverage brand Innocent Drinks (now part of Coca-Cola), recently told a roomful of fellow executives at B Corpsï¿½ annual European summit: ï¿½We are the first generation of leaders who cannot say we didnï¿½t know [about the climate emergency] ï¿½ and we are also the last generation who can do anything about it.ï¿½ The growing demand for a fairer, more caring form of capitalism has also given rise to a related phenomenon: the emergence of the purpose-driven consultant. Over recent years, a cottage industry of advisory firms has sprung up, all promising to help companies on this ï¿½journeyï¿½ (a favourite phrase) towards a more purposeful, less profit-centric model of business. In the spirit of business-as-unusual, their approach is refreshingly unorthodox. ï¿½Boldï¿½, ï¿½heartfeltï¿½ and ï¿½emotionally involvedï¿½ are among the defining characteristics that sustainability expert Ed Gillespie associates with this new breed of consultant. To get the ball rolling, for example, conventional companies may well need a dose of shock therapy, according to Gillespie, who styles himself as an ï¿½insultantï¿½: ï¿½Sometimes this will involve making clients feel very uncomfortable and might even lead to losing pitches, which most consultants are too chicken to do.ï¿½ Another hallmark of these challenger consultants is their focus on the motivations and mindsets of individual decision makers. Alter how executives think and changes in business strategy and values will follow, the logic goes. David Rosenberg is one such proponent of this more personal approach. An associate at the advisory firm Better Future (also a certified B Corp), he is involved in taking corporate executives on ï¿½learning journeysï¿½ to overseas locations that lie ï¿½outside their comfort zoneï¿½. Past examples include home stays for cocoa-sector execs with smallholder farmers in Africa, and for bankers with their microfinance customers. ï¿½You confront them with challenges rooted in observable realities, [which] gives them fresh perspectives on their impacts in the world and presents opportunities for positive change,ï¿½ says Rosenberg. For now, the companies and consultants pushing to reset capitalism occupy the fringes of the business mainstream. This is not surprising: attachments to shareholder capitalism and the pursuit for profit run deep. But change is in the air. And itï¿½s this cohort of dissenters and disruptors who are pointing the way. ÿ25.11.2019ÿGood company: the capitalists putting purpose ahead of profit

The reason? These fertilisers heavily increase levels of GHG emissions from soil, and therefore contribute to climate change. Among them, there is one that is rarely mentioned: nitrous oxide (N2O). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), N2O is the third major greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere. It has a global warming potential 300 times higher than carbon dioxide (CO2). And it results from agricultural activities ï¿½ from biomass combustion and chemical products such as nitric acid. To add to the complexity of the issue, nitrous oxide ï¿½ which represents over 70 percent of global GHG emissions from agriculture ï¿½ stays in the atmosphere for around 120 years. A growing number of players in the agricultural sector are therefore turning to alternative solutions such as organic inputs in order to reduce the use of nitrogen fertilisers. One of them is the Swiss group ï¿½lï¿½phant Vert, created by the Antenna Technologies Foundation, for which business is flourishing. The group has found its niche market in the production of fertilisers, bio-stimulants and bio-pesticides that are both organic and profitable, and derived from natural microorganisms. ï¿½lï¿½phant Vert officially started in Morocco, where its first subsidiary opened seven years ago, and has since developed into the largest industrial bio-input hub in Africa. Its first major industrial investments were made in this country, with the opening of two factories. one specialised in the production of bio-pesticides, microorganisms and bio-stimulants. and the other dedicated to bio-fertilisers, designed for processing and recycling agricultural by-products. In order to promote and ensure wider access to ï¿½lï¿½phant Vertï¿½s agricultural methods, the group opened its Clinique des plantes (CDP), a teaching centre in Meknï¿½s, in 2014. Through the CDP, ï¿½lï¿½phant Vert has trained thousands of Moroccan farmers, either on behalf of the companyï¿½s clients, or through missions to support public agricultural organisations. Recently, the CDP acquired an analysis and quality control laboratory, which has been accredited by the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture. Through the diversification of its businesses, ï¿½lï¿½phant Vert has developed an approach that embraces every stage of the agricultural chain. ï¿½We have the capacity to carry out soil and environmental analysis, come up with tailor-made sustainable fertilisation programs, facilitate crop establishment based on organic fertilisation and of course, support the farmer along the whole production cycle through fertigation [a fertilization technique using irrigation] and biological pest control,ï¿½ said Anouar Alasri, executive director of ï¿½lï¿½phant Vertï¿½s Moroccan subsidiary. The group has consolidated its position on the African continent through the opening of four subsidiaries in West Africa. They are located in Mali, a country that has opted to subsidise bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides. in Senegal, where the subsidiary has been growing commercially for the past two years. in Ivory Coast, through the acquisition of a local company that makes bio-fertilisers. and in Kenya, via the company Kenya Biologics Limited, which specialises in bio-control. Potential openings in other countries are under examination. Having reached cruising speed in terms of expansion in Africa, ï¿½lï¿½phant Vert is now looking to shore up its presence in Europe through the acquisition of innovative small and medium enterprises, such as Or Brun and Xurian Environnement in France. ï¿½European expansion will help strengthen the African subsidiaries, since our intermeshed territorial network will ensure a unique complementarity in expertise, with regard to research and development as much as in terms of producing products that are adapted to the contexts of each country,ï¿½ Alasri said. This promising cross-cultural approach is driven by the urgent need for a change in agricultural practices. ï¿½lï¿½phant Vert has also established ties with research institutions, notably the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA). The institute has just launched a new research programme to examine nitrogen and carbon dynamics in Moroccan soils, following the successful application of organic soil enrichers (compost and other fertilisers made from organic waste). The study is primarily concerned with GHGs, notably CO2, N2O and methane. ï¿½The focus is on soil, which is the basis of agriculture, and the fertility of which is a huge cause of concern. If we still manage to produce, even with the intensification of agriculture, itï¿½s because weï¿½re still overexploiting the soil in a non-sustainable way,ï¿½ said Khalid Azim, specialist in organic agriculture and composting and researcher of the INRA in Agadir. As an example, in Europe, soil that has less than three percent organic matter is considered a low-fertility soil. Yet the level recorded by the Moroccan researchers is close to just 0.4 percent organic matter. As demand from those who work in the organic sector is constantly increasing, now is the time to concentrate efforts on innovation to improve soil quality. ÿ25.11.2019ÿThe first industrial hub for organic inputs in Africa is ready to take on Europe

Kimbel is executive director of Morphosis, a business based in northern France. Over the past 10 years, his company has cashed in on the tiny treasures ï¿½ silver, platinum, copper ï¿½ hidden within the cards and hard disks in our discarded computers, cell phones and other gadgets. ""Weï¿½re not the only ones to operate in this market. The mining industry has also started recovering these metals. But in terms of price, we are more competitive because our materials are of a very high purity and are retransformed according to the specific needs of manufacturers,"" explained the founder of this SME of around 50 employees. Each year, 25,000 tonnes of WEEE are crushed and ground up at the firmï¿½s two sites in Le Havre in order to recover their precious contents. Morphosis uses an industrial process that combines mechanical, chemical and thermal treatments to extract the ""ore"" from this waste, 80 percent of which is delivered dismantled. This sector has strong potential for growth, given that the market for these electronic goods is growing by ""eight to nine percent per year,"" Kimbel said. European Union forecasters predict that within its borders alone, the volume of waste to be treated could reach 12 million tonnes by 2020. While this mine of opportunities looks promising, the treatment of e-waste is becoming more and more complex. Volumes of WEEE are increasing, yet the concentrations of rare metals that they contain are growing scarcer, and competition for them is heating up. Asian countries, the biggest producers of this waste stream, are increasingly active in this market. Itï¿½s a domain where financial interests are converging with environmental ones. Extraction industries are highly energy consuming and release huge amounts of CO2, making them the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet. Gold represents only 0.0011 grammes for every tonne of the earthï¿½s crust ï¿½ and so mountains must be moved to uncover the rare metal. When it comes to the salvaged treasures of the circular economy, the odds of striking gold are a lot higher. Take mobile phones, for example: one tonne of electronic cards can contain up to one kilogramme of gold, five kilogrammes of silver, nine kilogrammes of tantalum and 250 kilogrammes of copper. A recent study by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (Ademe) revealed that in 2012, barely a quarter of the electronic cards collected were actually processed. This translates to a loss in value of 124 million euros (USD 143 million) for the unextracted gold alone. ""Weï¿½re working to ensure we have the lowest energy consumption and CO2 emissions possible. Itï¿½s important for our financial sustainability,"" Kimbel noted. When Morphosis burns the plastic from memory cards, the heat created is reused in the processing of rare metals and also to heat the businessï¿½s premises in Le Havre. The buildings that make up Morphosisï¿½s new unit in Fï¿½camp, Normandy, will be entirely passive, largely thanks to the photovoltaic electricity generated there. The company is investing five million euros into the unit, with the aim of treating a wide variety of products, obtaining a high recovery yield and keeping energy consumption low. Morphosis believes in investing on innovation. ""R&D represents considerably more than 10 percent of our turnover,"" which reached 12 million euros in 2017, Kimbel said. His ambition is to make Morphosis the biggest recycling site for electronic cards in France. One drawback is that the company is seeking its supplies from zones that are increasingly further afield: Morphosis gets its raw materials from Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Clearly there are consequences for the firmï¿½s carbon footprint. However, Kimbel said, this consideration should be put into perspective. ""Le Havreï¿½s port enables us to make shipments by sea,"" he noted. ""We make huge savings compared to using road transport, and the ratio of CO2 per tonne transported is significantly lower.""

If South Korea, the United States and the European Union have an ELT recovery rate of 85 percent, itï¿½s a whole different story for developing countries. In Mexico, for instance, only 10 percent of the 40 million tonnes of tyres discarded every year is recycled. The rest end up in landfills, rivers or on the streets, according to the countryï¿½s Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources. But some Mexican companies ï¿½ such as Granutec, Trisol and HM Energy Mexico ï¿½ are reusing these tyres to produce waterproof coating, flooring and a fuel alternative to diesel, creating cost-effective business models while combatting pollution. Using mechanical processes to recycle the material rather than burning it avoids releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, a major contributor to climate change. Last year, CO2 emissions reached a record high of 405 parts per million, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Magda Espinosa, general manager of Andellac, the Mexican national association of tyre dealers and distributors, points out that the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources issued official regulations three years ago for tyre producers and retailers to recycle their products. The goal is to have 14 million tyres recycled in a five-year period. So far, 5.4 million have been recycled, or 1.8 million per year. Granutec is a family company based in Ecatepec, Mexico, that began operating 40 years ago under the name Central Hulera ï¿½lvarez, recycling tyres to produce shoe and boot soles for farmers. At first, only 40 percent of their raw materials came from recycling, but they developed a green waterproof coating that allowed them to create their products entirely from scrap tyres. The company now processes 120 tonnes of tyres every month at their factory, and has a recycling capacity of 400 tonnes at their storage centre. Over the last year, their profits rose by 40 percent. It takes a single tyre to produce a 19-litre bucket of waterproof coating that, once applied, can cover up to 20 square metres. It is an eco-friendly process, as it does not involve burning tyres. ï¿½We use roller screws to grind the material. Afterward, we separate the bead wire from the tyre by using magnets, and then we get the textile fibre,ï¿½ says Alvarez. Finally, they add a sealant to the rubber granulates and powder to create the waterproof coating. The company also manufactures rubber flooring and vinyl paint, and is currently seeking to expand across Mexico on a franchise model. In 2011, Andrï¿½s Garcï¿½a Gasca founded Trisol, a company that manufactures carpets, partition walls, running tracks, roads and waterproof coating from scrap tyres. Like Granutec, Trisol uses a mechanical process to separate metal, textile fibres and rubber, producing rubber granules of different sizes that become the companyï¿½s products for the GreenOutdoors line. The firmï¿½s rubber flooring can be found inside the elephantsï¿½ habitat at the State of Mexicoï¿½s Zoo. The material can resist up to eight tonnes of weight and improve temperature conditions inside the habitat, minimising the elephantsï¿½ arthritis and allowing for better rest. ï¿½It takes only one tyre to create two square metres of flooring. For the elephantsï¿½ habitat, for instance, we used 500 tyres, reducing considerably their environmental impact,ï¿½ Garcï¿½a explains. The company has two factories in the State of Mexico, in Tultitlï¿½n and Ixtapaluca. Together, they process 30 tonnes of tyres every month, says Adriï¿½n Zavala Valadez, Trisolï¿½s newest partner. He adds that the firm recycles 3,000 additional tonnes par month thanks to a partnership with an American company (whose name Valadez prefers not to disclose). The Monterrey-based company HM Energy transforms scrap tyres into a fuel alternative to diesel for open-flame boilers, recycled steel and carbon black. ï¿½It is a thermal process. The tyre, cut open, enters a 10-tonne capacity reactor, where oxygen is extracted and the temperature rises as high as 520 degrees. As a result, hydrocarbon evaporates from the tyre and condenses until you obtain a diesel substitute. The steel stays inside the reactor. From this process we then make the carbon black,ï¿½ says Israel Magaï¿½a, co-founder of HM Energy. In its Nuevo Leï¿½n-based plant, the company processes 10 tonnes of tyres a day. ï¿½Our products spare the environment around 35 percent of CO2 from diesel emissions, 98 percent from steel and another 98 percent from carbon black,ï¿½ Magaï¿½a claims. These savings amount to roughly 6.7 times the CO2-equivalent absorbed by all the trees in Central Park, New York. The company began operating in 2016, and now hopes to build its second processing plant in Mï¿½rida, Yucatï¿½n, to reach a total production of 15 million litres of green fuel per year, saving the planet annually 38 thousand tonnes of CO2 emissions. ÿ25.11.2019ÿMexican entrepreneurs create sustainable products from scrap tyres

According to the study ï¿½Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made,ï¿½ published in Science Advances magazine in 2017, 8.3 billion tonnes have been produced worldwide in the last 65 years ï¿½ weighing the equivalent of 10,000 Eiffel Towers or 35,000 Empire State Building. The problem is that only nine percent of all plastic waste gets recycled, while the rest ends up in nature. Eight million tonnes of plastics go into the ocean every year ï¿½ a figure that may rise to 500 million by 2020 if the situation does not improve. In Mexico, PET consumption reaches 722,000 tonnes per year. The country ranks first in bottled water consumption worldwide, according to the Environmental Commission of the Mexican House of Representatives, and second when it comes to soft drink bottles. But the country has made important progress, according to the local environmental NGO Ecoce. PET collection and recycling increased from 6 to 58 percent in the last 15 years, ahead of Brazil (42 percent), Canada (40 percent) and the United States (31 percent). Norwayï¿½s recycling culture leads the way with a 95 percent rate. Growing awareness of PET environmental consequences is encouraging people to take action. Mexicoï¿½s Carlos Gonzï¿½lez, CEO of EcoDom, is an example. His company, based in Xicotepec de Juï¿½rez, Puebla, turns plastic waste into construction materials to build affordable housing for low-income families. Gonzï¿½lez grew up in the mountains near Puebla, one of the most disadvantaged regions in the country, surrounded by poverty, lack of access to decent housing and plastic pollution. He conceived and created his business model in 2012. ï¿½Our goal is to deeply clean Mexico, and the world, of plastic by taking advantage of its propertiesï¿½ potential for construction ï¿½ it doesnï¿½t biodegrade, get damp or moth-eaten,ï¿½ the entrepreneur explains. The company recycles mainly PET, but also high-density Polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), usually found in broken buckets, toys or bags. Gonzï¿½lez buys the material by the kilogram from small companies, or from independent collectors with whom the company regularly works. EcoDom also organises waste picking operations in Puebla, where volunteers join the firmï¿½s employees to collect plastics from households or businesses. ï¿½We select the plastics and grind them through an industrial process to turn them into flakes, which are then placed into a mould, melted and, once in a plasma state, taken to a press that applies pressure to produce the raw material for our products,ï¿½ Gonzï¿½lez explains. To create a wall, the company transforms around six kilograms of plastics. The whole process costs from 50 to 60 Mexican pesos, or nearly three dollars. EcoDom generates revenue from selling plastic-derived construction materials such as containing walls, earthenware, mezzanines and thermic roofs. but also from building houses and selling properties to low-income families. Roughly 10 percent of its profits are destined for social causes. With these funds, the company is able to sell partially subsidised 42 square-metre houses for 5,000 pesos (USD 265) or single rooms for 1,000 pesos. Buyers are allowed to pay with work instead of money. ï¿½Our houses cost less than others made entirely ofconcrete. One of the perks of our system is that the material can resist up to twice the load of traditional building materials, which speeds the construction phase and allows for savings of up to 25 percent of the total cost. Traditional building materials resist 2.5 kilos per square centimetre, whereas ours can hold up to 5.3 kilos per square centimetre,ï¿½ says EcoDomï¿½s CEO. The company also started donating houses to families last year. So far, it has sold two houses and donated five houses and three bedrooms. Now, they are negotiating the terms of an agreement with Pueblaï¿½s Cuauhtï¿½moc University to donate five other houses. Gonzï¿½lez began this project alone, but with help from his now partner, Eily Cristell Velï¿½zquez. Today EcoDom has three more shareholders. Together, they have invested more than eight million pesos so far, and have managed to stir interest from companies in India, Canada, France, Brazil, South Africa, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic. An agreement with the latterï¿½s government is under negotiation, in a bid to tackle the massive plastic pollution problem off the coast of Santo Domingo that made headlines earlier this year. Gonzï¿½lez says heï¿½s proud of what his company has achieved and plans to enlarge its scope through a franchise model. In December, he will join the Mexican construction company Haras to build 250 houses in Puebla. EcoDom hopes to provide the necessary materials and expertise to construct at least half of the houses. ÿ25.11.2019ÿThis is the low-cost home that Josï¿½ built ï¿½ with recycled plastics!

The future of the manufacturing sector lies in its capacity to recycle, reduce reliance on raw materials, and cut down on both material and energy waste. This is the European Unionï¿½s position, but it is also supported by the performance of businesses that operate within the circular economy and are more successful than their peers. Italy never had a wealth of natural resources, so its economy has been trained to operate in an environment of scarcity. Now, the country is well placed among its competitors in the global circular economy. From scrap metal in Brescia to rags in Prato to paper waste in Lucca, Italian manufacturers have followed the best practices for centuries. But thereï¿½s always room for more. ï¿½Italyï¿½s production system ranks first among major European economies for the use of recycled secondary raw materials,ï¿½ says Domenico Sturabotti, director of Fondazione Symbola, Italyï¿½s reference point for businesses transitioning to a circular production system. According to Eurostat figures, 18.5 percent of all materials used in Italyï¿½s factories are secondary raw ones. Germany, the only major European economy with a larger manufacturing sector, trails with 10.7 percent. Among major European economies, Italy also has the second most efficient raw materials usage rate, consuming half as many raw materials as it did in 2008. Italy now uses some 256 tonnes of raw materials per million euros, compared to Germanyï¿½s 424 tonnes per million euros. The UK comes in first with 223 tonnes per million euros, but its economy relies on the financial sector more heavily than Italyï¿½s. Italy is Europeï¿½s second industrial recycler, with close to 48 million tonnes of non-hazardous waste recycled each year (Germany recycles 59 million tonnes). Through recycling, Italy saves an amount of primary energy equivalent to 17 million tonnes of oil, while also reducing CO2 emissions by 60 million tonnes. But cutting emissions and energy bills is not the only advantage that the circular economy presents. ï¿½Higher efficiency means fewer production costs, less dependence on raw materials from foreign countries, and more innovation ï¿½ be it new products made from waste or used appliances, recycling clothes, or using agricultural waste to produce bioplastic,ï¿½ says Sturabotti. ï¿½In 2017, 27 percent of the medium-sized industrial companies focused on eco-efficiency invested in research and development, while only 18 percent of those who are not focused on eco-efficiency made the same kind of investment.ï¿½ The effects on productivity are even greater. According to a joint study by Symbola and Unioncamere (the Italian Chamber of Commerce), ï¿½Between 2014 and 2016, the medium-sized industrial businesses that invested in eco-innovation performed better than those that didnï¿½t.ï¿½ Better performance went hand in hand with an increase in job creation: some 41 percent of eco-innovation companies reported an increase in their number of employees, compared to 31 percent of other companies. Exports also rose by 49 percent, compared to 33 percent for other companies. Basically, a circular economy triggers growth, as evidenced by the stories of businesses that have turned environmental challenges into opportunities, using 4.0 manufacturing technology. The shift has affected all industries and supply chains, but the machinery industry has been able to benefit the most ï¿½ designing more efficient and recycling-oriented products. Success stories include companies such as Dellï¿½Orco & Villani in Florence and Tonello in Vicenza. Tonello produces machines that top fashion brands use to finish clothes. They use far less energy than competitorsï¿½ machines, and feature a continuous water-recycling system. Tonelloï¿½s ï¿½NoStoneï¿½ technology has gained recognition for giving jeans a distressed look through mechanical processes, without chemical products, industrial powders or lime. More traditional ï¿½Made in Italyï¿½ business sectors have also thrived. Take furniture manufacturing, for example: Saviola, in the Mantua region, recovers 1.5 million tonnes of wood from landfill and produces chipboards in 14 different factories across Italy, Belgium and Argentina without chopping down a single tree. In the fashion industry, thermic padding company Thermore, which has invested in plastic recycling since the 1980s, has made collections exclusively from recycled polyester. The Ecodown collection, for instance, uses only fibers obtained from recycled plastic. The average Ecodown coat is made from 10 plastic bottles that would otherwise be thrown away. Meanwhile, lifestyle and consumption patterns are also changing at a fast pace. Some 59 percent of Italians say they care about sustainability, according to a study conducted by Lifegate, a sustainable innovation international network. The organic food industry has doubled its revenues, nearing the five billion euro mark. Ethical consumption is booming.

Earlier this week, nearly 100 students at J.W. Mitchell High School in New Port Richey, Florida were able to try a revolutionary new educational tool: the SynFrog, a hyper-realistic synthetic frog that can completely replace the use of frogs for dissection in K–12 and collegiate science classes. At least 3 million frogs are killed annually for such lessons. In addition to contributing to declining frog populations, frog dissections can also discourage queasier students from taking more of an interest in science. That’s why SynDaver—the world’s leading manufacturer of hyper-realistic, synthetic human and animal surgical trainers—partnered with PETA to create the true-to-life, hands-on dissectible frog so that it is almost indistinguishable from real ones. Unlike the preserved bodies of dead frogs, which are bathed in chemicals and have monochromatic organs that are difficult to differentiate, the SynFrog is free of formaldehyde and formalin and contains removable and anatomically correct organs that accurately mimic living tissue. “PETA has promoted virtual dissection for years, but some teachers still request ‘hands-on’ teaching tools—and that’s where the SynFrog comes in,” says PETA Vice President of International Laboratory Methods Shalin Gala. “It’s safer, more effective, and more humane.” The frogs are currently being sold for $150 apiece on the SynDaver website. Despite how the replica is significantly more expensive than a real frog, its synthetic tissues—made out of water, fibers, and salts—means they are also reusable and chemical-free. “With SynFrog, there’s no longer any need to harm real frogs for the sake of enhancing the educational experience,” reads the product bio. “In addition to eliminating the ethical concerns of sacrificing living animals to teach comparative anatomy, SynFrog is a better option for students because it does not expose them to hazardous chemicals, like formaldehyde and formalin.”ÿ14.11.2019ÿHyper-Realistic Replicas Finally Spare Students—and Declining Frog Populations—From Biology Class Dissections

They were hunted almost entirely to extinction here, because of the value of their skins—but also because of the perceived threat they posed as fish hunters. Today, around the island of Palomino, as well as the isles of San Lorenzo and Carazcas, alone, there are over 8000 of these charismatic marine animals making their homes. Much of the success of restoring the fur seal and sea lion populations came from local fishermen in the coastal areas of Peru. The private sector stepped up to support these endangered species even more so than local governments, after the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) sounded their alarm bell. The world’s leading conservation organization maintains a “Red List” database of species and the degree to which they are threatened with extinction. In a recent news bulletin, the IUCN detailed how local fisheries along Peru’s coastline have become efficient managers, doling out to each trawler assigned areas for guarding over. “The Fishermen’s Union defines an area where each local fishing collective is dependent economically and assigns responsibility for these marine resources,” explains the IUCN. “In this manner, the fishermen themselves have slowed economic migration from the Peruvian highlands to lucrative uncontrolled and illegal marine activities, thus ensuring that the protected area flourishes”. Much of their motivation for marine protection has come from seeing their livelihood through new eyes, recognizing the rise of artisanal fisheries and tourism. UCN also runs a “Green List” to recognize global best practices for area-based conservation, and the program is already working with marine reserves along the Pacific coast, and—along with Chile, Ecuador and Colombia—Peru will promote investment and improved governance of its marine treasures and seek to raise the standard of performance along the coastline. “There is strong commitment from the fisher and tourism sectors, so the ingredients are there for success in Peruvian marine conservation,” reports the IUCN.ÿ14.11.2019ÿEndangered Seal and Sea Lion Populations Turned Around By Fishermen Who See the Creatures in a New Way

The GWC and their partners at the Southern Institute of Ecology and Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research made their rediscovery in southern Vietnam. Their findings, which were published this week in the scientific journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, is now spurring on efforts to protect the chevrotain and the other mysterious and extraordinary wildlife that share its home in Vietnam. “We had no idea what to expect, so I was surprised and overjoyed when we checked the camera traps and saw photographs of a mouse deer with silver flanks,” said An Nguyen, associate conservation scientist for GWC and expedition team leader. “For so long, this species has seemingly only existed as part of our imagination. Discovering that it is, indeed, still out there, is the first step in ensuring we don’t lose it again, and we’re moving quickly now to figure out how best to protect it.” The silver-backed chevrotain was described in 1910 from four individuals collected from southern Vietnam. A Russian expedition in 1990 in central Vietnam collected a fifth individual. Scientists know almost nothing about general ecology or conservation status of this species, making it one of the highest mammal conservation priorities in the Greater Annamite mountains, one of GWC’s focal wildlands. After several interviews with local villagers and government forest rangers who reported seeing a gray mouse deer—the color distinguishing the silver-backed chevrotain from the more common lesser mouse deer—the field team set three camera traps for five months in an area of southern Vietnam where locals indicated they may have seen the animal. This resulted in 275 photos of the species. The team then set up another 29 cameras in the same area, this time recording 1,881 photographs of the chevrotain over five months. “The rediscovery of the silver-backed chevrotain provides a big hope for the conservation of biodiversity, especially threatened species, in Vietnam,” said Hoang Minh Duc, head of the Southern Institute of Ecology’s Department of Zoology. “This also encourages us, together with relevant and international partners, to devote time and effort to further investigate and conserve Vietnam’s biodiversity heritage.” There are 10 known species of chevrotains in the world, primarily from Asia. Despite their common English names, chevrotains are neither mice nor deer, but the world’s smallest small ungulates (hoofed mammals). They are shy and solitary, appear to walk on the tips of their hooves and have two tiny fangs. Chevrotains typically weigh less than 11 pounds (5 kilograms). The silver-backed chevrotain is one of a number of fascinating species that live in the diverse tropical forests of Southeast Asia, where some species have been discovered only in the last few decades. This includes the antelope-like saola (the Asian “unicorn”), which was only discovered in 1992 and that no biologist has seen in the wild. A team is now setting out to determine how large—and stable—this population of silver-backed chevrotains is. assess the wider distribution of the species. and explore the threats to its survival. As part of the first-ever comprehensive survey on the species, the team began camera trap surveys in October in two additional areas. They will use all of the information that they gather to develop a conservation action plan that strengthens enforcement and protection of the species across its range, building on the increased enforcement already put in place at the site of rediscovery. “It is an amazing feat to go from complete lack of knowledge of the wildlife of the Greater Annamites 25 years ago to now having this question mark of the silver-backed chevrotain resolved,” said Barney Long, GWC senior director of species conservation. “But the work is only beginning with the rediscovery and initial protection measures that have been put in place—now we need to identify not just a few individuals on camera traps, but one or two sites with sizable populations so that we can actually protect and restore the species.”ÿ14.11.2019ÿRabbit-Sized ‘Mouse Deer’ Rediscovered in Vietnam After Being Lost to Science Since 1990

When little Gracie was only six weeks old, she was dumped at a vet and needed emergency treatment for 2 different wounds, which were full of worms. Thanks to a loving family that runs an animal rescue group near Atlanta, Georgia, she was rehabilitated one year ago and given a forever home by the Turleys themselves. Best of all, she is now enjoying an ingenious adaptation of LEGOS fashioned into a canine wheelchair by 12-year-old Dylan, a volunteer at the Turley family facility called Mostly Mutts Animal Rescue in Kennesaw. Gracie gets around fine without a chair, but the cushioned device that lifts her up helps keep her chest and spine safe. The cheerful pup can now run, and even go up and down stairs using the big wheels—and the wheelchair can grow with her by simply adding LEGOS. Many different materials can be used in the construction of wheelchairs for dogs—steel, aluminum, PVC tubes, canvas, and 3D plastic, but LEGO bricks glued together seems like an ingenious DIY way to make use of materials at hand—using a skill Dylan might have learned in childhood, with a loving pup like ‘Amazing Gracie’ at his side.ÿ14.11.2019ÿ12-Year-Old Volunteer Gives a Rescued Pup a Wheelchair Made of LEGOS

In 1971, there were only around 200 singing male warblers left, surviving in just six counties in northern Michigan, within a particular area of jack pine forests specific to its nesting requirements. When the Endangered Species Act was first signed into law in 1973, the tiny songbird was one of the first species added—and efforts were launched to save it. Today, after 90,000 acres of additional jack pine forests were created to support its habitat, a recent census that counted individual songs, found that their population had increased 11 fold, to 2,383 pairs—more than double the recovery goal. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have described the 50-year project as a regulatory and collaborative success story, citing the outstanding work of the Michigan State wildlife authorities who have worked for a half century to expand nesting habitat and reduce the population of brown-headed cowbirds—a predator species that competes by laying their eggs in warbler nests, the babies of which, when hatched, overcome the smaller warblers. The revival of the notably loudmouthed songbird has been described as “a shining example of what it takes to save imperiled species,” by Margaret Everson, principal deputy director of the Fish and Wildlife Service. The warbler, with its beautiful golden bib in the center of azure-grey feathers, has spread geographically, expanding beyond the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan to areas in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, Wisconsin and Ontario. Last week, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that the Kirtland’s warbler no longer warrants protection under the Endangered Species Act. “Conservation will continue to require a coordinated, multi-agency approach for planning and implementing conservation efforts into the future,” FWS stated, citing the need for partnerships and “sufficient funding” to continue to ensure the population is stable. Historically, wildfires were the most important factor for establishing the natural jack pine forests that Kirtland’s warblers need for breeding habitat. Modern wildfire suppression greatly diminished the natural disturbance that once generated the perfect breeding habitat. In the absence of wildfire, land managers had to take an active role in mimicking natural processes that regularly occurred within the jack pine ecosystem—primarily through timber harvesting and human-assisted reforestation. Today, the sale of jack pine timber on sites where reforestation will occur is critical to managing Kirtland’s warbler breeding habitat. Timber receipts offset the cost of replanting jack pine needed to support a viable population of nesting Kirtland’s warblers that would not otherwise be feasible through conservation dollars. “Private forest owners are proud partners in this major milestone and committed to the long-term health of the Kirtland’s warbler,” said Dave Tenny, founding President and CEO of the National Alliance of Forest Owners. The successful management of the Kirtland’s warbler is a prime example of how cooperative conservation without conflict can produce a win-win for all.ÿ14.11.2019ÿ50 Years of Conservation Finally Lifts This Beloved Warbler Off The Endangered Species List

Loijuk was only 5 months when rescuers from the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (SWT) found her stranded in an arid, drought-stricken region of northern Kenya. After nursing her back to health, the happy pachyderm spent her adolescence surrounded by an adopted herd of other orphaned and rescued elephants just like her. Though Loijuk now lives in the wild, she often returns to the SWT’s Ithumba Stockades so she can visit her human caregivers. Loijuk’s most recent visit on September 1st, however, marked a very special occasion: she had just given birth to a female calf and she wanted to introduce the baby to the SWT rescuers. “It is so special to witness Loijuk welcome and encourage the interaction, inviting head Keeper Benjamin to enjoy her newborn baby, unperturbed by their shenanigans together, and to immediately see the joy this new life brings the whole Ithumba Unit of dependent orphans and ex-orphan’s alike,” writes the SWT staffers. “Watching her heal, flourish and transition to a wild independent life again in the span of 14 years, surrounded by ex-orphans and wild elephant friends, and now to see her transform into a mother is the ultimate affirmation of a job well done.” The calf, which has been named Lili, is the 31st recorded offspring born to a rescued SWT elephant. Since it is currently the dry season in Kenya, Loijuk has stayed close to the wildlife shelter so she and her calf can enjoy extra support from the human rescuers until the weather cools off.ÿ14.11.2019ÿOrphaned Elephant Returns to Human Rescuers So She Can Introduce Them to Her Newborn Calf

Around 50 young activists in a dozen vehicles broke into the farm near Osona, in Catalonia, last Sunday, where the farmers apparently tried to halt the theft, and called the police. Despite police intervention, the activists got away with 16 rabbits. But according to local paper La Vanguardia, a vet’s report prepared by the farm before it files an official complaint indicates the loss of the 16 rabbits, some of which were reportedly pregnant or lactating, has in turn led to the deaths of over 90 of their offspring who were dependent upon them. The vet’s report also alleges five rabbits were severely injured during the raid and reportedly also died as a result. According to a vegan activist who goes by the online avatar “Mythical Mia”, during the chaotic confrontation farmers hit the activists with metal poles, and strangled them. After the police and the activists left, the farmers reportedly began a high-speed chase down a motorway, allegedly shooting out the windows of a car in which Mia was travelling in, leaving her with blood pouring down her face, a video shows. Speaking to The Independent, Mia denied there was any truth to reports so many animals had died in relation to the group’s actions. She said: ""This is false information with no evidence to back it up. We were inside that farm for less than five minutes and we only touched the rabbits who we rescued, who are all doing fine now, despite being very sick when rescued due to the filthy living conditions of that farm. “We did not leave any babies without their mothers as we only rescued young ones. We had a professional vet on site with us the whole time. I would like to see the official documentation, vet report and post mortem of any of these claims since I strongly believe that if any of the mothers were ‘forced to have abortions’ (as the farm alleged), then it was definitely due to the horrific conditions they were already living in when we arrived, that thanks to us, have now been exposed. “We have videos of a bunch of dead rabbits left to rot inside the farm and in the bin outside, who were already there when we got there. “It’s clearly convenient for them to blame on us a crime that was already committed before we even arrived. This industry has deceived the public for far too long.” Writing about the farmers’ actions on Instagram, she said: “The police came and told us to leave peacefully, which we did. After we left the farmers chased us down the motorway at 200kph for an hour.” The activists then also called the police and were reportedly given an escort as they continued their journey, but when the police left them, the farmers reportedly caught up “came alongside and shot at us”, the activist said. In her video, she says, in an English accent: “I’m covered in blood. This is what the farmers have done. They shot through our window and chased us down the motorway. Oh my god, I’m literally covered in blood.” Writing afterwards she said: “The window exploded in my face and there was a lot of blood from all the glass. We’re currently at the hospital and waiting to go to the police station to report this crime.” She added: “The most important thing is that the non-human animals are safe. They are far from that hell hole.” Another activist who was on the raid and is described as a vet, documented the state of one of the rabbits they stole from the farm. “The female rabbit “was dehydrated, hungry and was uncontrollably [running in circles] as a result of a preventative disease. A direct result of this violent and exploitative industry. “Immediate treatment and care will ensure her survival, as well as her fighting spirit to live especially now she is free. She began to improve quickly and is receiving all the treatment needed to make a full recovery.” The owner of the farm also described himself as a victim of assault at the hands of the activists on Catalunya Radio. The activists also posted links to videos made by animal rights activists Animal Equality, which has investigated conditions on several Spanish rabbit farms over two years and filmed brutal and inhumane conditions and treatment, with high rates of mortality, disease and sickness."ÿ16.11.2019ÿVegan activists 'cause death of 100 rabbits' with rescue raid, famers claim

A scandal around the “wolf pack” rape case, which occurred during the event in 2016, and frequent protests from animal rights activists have damaged the festival's reputation. On the eve of this year’s event, dozens of semi-naked activists from AnimaNaturalis and Peta staged a performance simulating speared bulls lying dead on the city’s streets to protest alleged animal cruelty at the event. “Supporting the bull runs is the same as supporting bullfighting, as the same bulls that run in the mornings will later be tortured and killed in the bullring,” Aida Gascon, spokesperson for AnimalNaturalis, said. However, despite the protests, Pamplona’s official brass band played to an ecstatic crowd at the launch of the event, declaring “Long live San Fermin”, in reference to the saint honoured by the festival. Pamplona’s population swells from nearly 200,000 residents to around a million visitors during the festival, which is important for sustaining the city’s economy. In 2016, the city faced scrutiny after a gang rape of an 18-year-old woman at the festival received international attention, galvanizing Spain’s feminist movement. Last month, Spain’s Supreme Court overruled a nine year sentence for sexual abuse from the lower courts that was seen as too lenient and caused outrage across the country. The men were subsequently sentenced to 15 years in prison for rape in a widely publicised trial. In response to the case, authorities in Pamplona have stepped up police surveillance and set up information booths, mobile phone apps and 24-hour hotlines to allow for instant reporting of abuse cases. However, old issues remain at the festival, which has long been accused of animal cruelty over its treatment of bulls. Peta has called for bull running and bullfights to be removed from the festival. “Young bulls who have had very little contact with humans are transported to Pamplona on a long and stressful journey,” the organisation wrote in a recent petition. “The festival organisers confine them to a small pen for several days. Then, they release them into a noisy, chaotic mob of people – mostly tourists – who chase the terrified animals through the narrow streets of the city.” At least 48 bulls are killed each year during the festival, the organisation said.

The incident took place on Sunday when the boy was playing in the backyard of his family home in Layton and reached through the fence and into the neighbours' backyard where the two dogs—Polar and Bear—were, law enforcement said. Jason Cook, the Battalion chief at Layton Fire Department, told NBC News that the child wore a sock on his arm when one of the dogs bit him so hard it ripped off a part of his limb. The boy, while in stable condition, was subsequently airlifted to a hospital and underwent surgery to amputate his arm. Mr Cook said he “never been a part of a call like that” throughout his 29-year career in the fire department. The dogs are currently quarantined in Davis County Animal Control as law enforcement investigates the incident. Davis County Animal Control Director Rhett Nicks believes it is likely for the dogs to be euthanised based on the severity of the boy’s injury. “We are doing a dangerous dog investigation, which could range from nothing being done up to euthanasia,” Mr Nicks told an NBC affiliate. Animal lovers are fighting back. Jessica Nusz, a best friend of Polar and Bear’s owner, created a Care2 petition to spare the dogs’ life who were involved in an “unfortunate accident.” She said the dog thought it was playing with a toy, “bit down too hard and didn’t see that there was a child on the other side of the fence.” “This situation is unfortunate on both sides,” the petition reads. “And now both dogs are in quarantine at Davis county animal control. There are fears that Bear might be put down and he doesn’t deserve to be put down for this freak accident.” More than 160,000 people signed the petition as of Thursday morning.

But what is it and why has the event in this remote part of southern China proved to be so controversial in recent years? What is the Yulin Dog Meat Festival? The Yulin “Lychee and Dog Meat” festival is an annual 10 day event where over 10,000 dogs are eaten. Cat meat, fresh lychees and liquor are also available at the festival. When and where does it take place? It takes place in Yulin, a city in the Guangxi province of China, and runs from the 21 to 30 June during one of the hottest weeks of the year. How did it start? The first festival took place in 2009 to mark the summer solstice. Dog eating is traditional in China, and according to folklore eating the meat during the summer months brings luck and good health. Some also believe dog meat can ward off diseases and heighten men's sexual performance. What is the controversy surrounding it? The festival has attracted widespread negative coverage within China and internationally. Activists have reported that animals are slaughtered inhumanely using clubs in public and that hygiene practices at the festival do not fall in line with Chinese regulations. There are also complaints that dogs are brought to Yulin from across China in cramped conditions, and festival visitors have reported seeing some animals with collars, indicating they are stolen pets. Is it seen differently in China? Eating dogs is not illegal in China. Around 10 to 20 million are killed for human consumption every year and although the festival is new the custom can be traced back at least 400 years. But attitudes are changing. Keeping dogs as pets was banned during the Cultural Revolution, but dog ownership has become popular among China’s growing middle-class. there are now 62 million registered as pets. Animal activists, celebrities and younger Chinese citizens have been increasingly vocal on social media about opposing dog eating festivals and the practice in general. Will activists get their wish and see it stopped? At the moment, this seems unlikely. US activists claimed that there was a ban on the sale of dog meat at the festival but this has proved to be incorrect. Visitors have reported less public slaughters and the removal of signs indicating dog meat is for sale. The Yulin Municipal Government has repeatedly said that it is not able to stop the festival as it claims it does not exist as an official event.ÿ21.11.2019ÿThe shocking truth behind the Yulin Dog Meat Festival

Iranian state media had not confirmed the sentences at the time of publication, but a defendant's former lawyer confirmed the sentences on Iran International. “It’s unfortunate that my friends, who led their lives in service of the environment and wildlife conservation, had any charges made against them to begin with, but even more surprising that they have received an exaggerated sentenced despite the fact that not a single shred of evidence...has been produced,” said Mehran Seyed-Emami in an email. He is the son of PWHF’s managing director Kavous Seyed-Emami, a dual Iranian-Canadian citizen who died in custody in Evin Prison in 2018. Despite his family’s calls for an independent investigation, one has not been permitted.  Four of the researchers initially faced charges of “sowing corruption on Earth,” which carried a possible death penalty. Those charges were dropped in mid-October for unknown reasons. Few details have emerged from the closed court hearings, but Niloufar Bayani’s reportedly defiant testimony, which alleged psychological, physical, and pharmaceutical torture in detention, according to The Center for Human Rights in Iran, casts further doubt on the integrity of the judicial process and raised concerns of forced confessions. Several inquiries, including by government’s intelligence ministry (which is separate from the Revolutionary Guards’ intelligence branch), the Supreme National Security Council, and Department of the Environment, with which PWHF worked closely, failed to turn up any evidence suggesting the researchers were involved with spying, Seyed-Emami said.  The verdicts come as protests triggered by rising fuel costs roil Iran, with the country in the grips of a comprehensive internet shutdown. Researchers and conservationists who worked with the eight reject the allegations against their colleagues and say the organisation’s upstanding conservation work was jeopardised by a donor with a political agenda. The verdicts are sure to draw further condemnation by scientific, conservation, and human rights groups, which have noted a broader crackdown on environmental activists in Iran. Amnesty International counted 63 arrests in 2018, based on media reports. When conservation and politics clash The case has stirred controversy within the big cat community. PWHF occasionally worked with the New York-based Panthera, one of the most prominent big cat conservation organisations in the world. On several instances, Panthera provided technical assistance and sent experts to Iran as part of the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah and Its Habitat Project (CACP), funded by the United Nations and Iran’s Department of the Environment. But in October 2017, PWHF severed ties with Panthera over anti-Iran comments made by its billionaire founder Thomas Kaplan. Kaplan helps fund the lobby group United Against Nuclear Iran, which argues for sanctions and regime change, and pushed heavily for the U.S. to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. The organisation counts among its members a number of senior intelligence and defence figures, including the former heads of Mossad and the CIA—agencies the researchers would ultimately be accused of working for. A letter seen by National Geographic from PWHF to Panthera suggests the Iranian researchers were worried that being associated with an organisation linked to someone publicly criticising Iran could be problematic for them. Preeminent biologist, conservationist, and author George Schaller wrote in an open letter that he strongly condemns the fact that Kaplan “[let] politics intrude into conservation,” and confirmed he had severed all ties with Panthera. (He was previously vice president and chair of the Cat Advisory Council).  Panthera and Thomas Kaplan have not responded to requests for comment, but when he was on The David Rubenstein Show earlier this year, Kaplan explained that wildlife conservation is a passion that dates back to childhood. “I had a dream that if I was going to go into business, one day I would be able to pivot back to this first great love and to enable the great wildlife conservationists who did have those aptitudes, so that they would be able to save the species that we love,” he said. Other notable conservationists have spoken out too, including Jane Goodall, who recorded a video appealing to Iran’s leaders for clemency, quoting 13th-century Persian poet Rumi: “In this earth, in this immaculate field, we shall not plant any seeds except of compassion, except of love.” A former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, Kaveh Madani, who went into self-imposed exile in the U.S. after hardliners accused him of being a foreign saboteur, wrote in a blog post prior to the verdicts’ announcement that “power games of radicals for selfish ends are jeopardising the sincere efforts of Iran’s environmental community.”‘Any hope for nature’ Saving endangered species requires international cooperation, and scientists are warning about the dangers of letting politics get in the way. It “could easily have been one of us,” said ecologist and National Geographic explorer Rodrigo Medellín at a scientific meeting in Bonn last week.  “The protection of threatened biodiversity...should, and must, transcend politics,” wrote Sarah Durant, cheetah researcher and professor of conservation science at the Zoological Society of London, in an email before the sentencing. She added that when the international community is considering sanctions against a particular country, access to international support and expertise for the purpose of conservation should be exempt from sanctions. “The conservationists currently imprisoned are some of the leading wildlife conservationists in Iran,” Durant said. “Before their arrest, their commitment to wildlife conservation had been making a real difference to Asiatic cheetah conservation.” Extinction of the Asiatic cheetah is imminent without concerted, immediate conservation, she said. The species once had a home range that spanned from the Red Sea to eastern India. Today there are believed to be only 50 cats left, all in Iran. Conservationists warn that failure to act will see it go the way of the Persian lion and the Caspian tiger. “Their imprisonment has seriously hampered the conservation of Asiatic cheetah,” Durant said. Former Panthera employee and National Geographic explorer Tanya Rosen, who works on big cat conservation in central Asia, had been working with the PWHF to organise a cheetah summit in Iran prior to their arrests, which she describes as “a last-ditch effort to generate funding to save the species”. When her colleagues were arrested, she and others sought to raise awareness of the case using the hashtag #AnyHopeForNature, a reference to Amirhossein Khaleghi Hamidi’s Instagram handle. “I started seeing the future of Asiatic cheetahs linked to those of our friends in jail,” she says. “There is hope for the Asiatic cheetah only if there is hope for our friends to be free.”ÿ22.11.2019ÿCheetah Researchers Accused Of Spying Sentenced In Iran

Meredith Lowell, 35, was charged with attempted murder and assault for the incident which took place at Fairmount Presbyterian Church in Cleveland Heights, US. It is believed Ms Lowell attacked a babysitter who was dropping off children at the church for choir practice and wearing fur boots, Cleavland.com reports. According to local news outlet WKYC-TV, the fur on the woman’s boots was actually fake. Chief Mecklenburg said at a press conference Thursday morning: “It is our belief the motive behind the attack was believed to be the victim wearing fur. “It’s a little different. It’s going to take a lot more legwork by our detectives but they are actively looking into everything.” Ms Lowell was also charged eight years ago in 2012 for offering $700 (£540) to an undercover FBI agent posing as a hit-man to kill someone wearing fur with either a gun or a knife. According to court documents, she also wanted the victim to be older than 12 and preferably older than 14, but anyone over 12 would be “OK”. But the case was dismissed by US District Judge Patricia Gaughan in January 2013 after a forensic psychologist found her incompetent to stand trial. Judge Gaughan said: “On January 11, 2013, Leslie Powers, Forensic Psychologist, issued a report stating that the defendant remained incompetent due to mental disease or defect, but did not pose a danger to herself, the community, or property.” Ms Lowell, 35, is currently being held on a $1 million bond (£774,380) after the attack Wednesday afternoon at the Presbyterian church. The activist allegedly stabbed her victim twice in the arm and once in the abdomen with a kitchen knife, according to a Cleveland Heights police report. A man wrestled Lowell to the floor and held her until officers arrived, the police report said. The victim remained hospitalised Thursday and her condition was unclear. Chief Mecklenburg commended the actions of the church staff member and parishioner who intervened. She said: “They put their safety at risk. They were able to restrain her and hold her down until the police arrived. “They are to be commended for their actions no doubt.” Lowell was arrested a year ago on suspicion of attacking someone she believed was wearing fur at a Whole Foods store in University Heights. A police report said Lowell punched and then tried to cut a woman wearing a jacket with fake fur on its hood with the serrated blade of a Swiss Army knife. The jacket was gashed, a police photo shows, but the woman was not cut. Lowell was indicted in January on one count of felonious assault in Cuyahoga County. An online court docket shows she pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity last month and the case is pending.ÿ23.11.2019ÿAnimal rights activist accused of stabbing woman wearing fake fur

Their startup company, Cast21, has created a waterproof, lightweight, and breathable alternative that can be worn while bathing, exercising, and even swimming in the ocean. The patented design is constructed from a wide mesh sleeve filled with two liquid resins which are molded into the correct position for each patient—and it is even available in a range of vibrant colors. Patients sporting traditional plaster or fiberglass casts are unable to clean underneath the molded brace, making the skin susceptible to rot and infection. When it is time to remove the hardened bandages, wearers are also forced to watch a doctor remove their casts using a circular saw. “The majority of fractures happen in children, adolescents and the elderly,” said Cast21’s VP of engineering Veronica Hogg. “Those saws are very loud and all this debris flies off and it’s very messy, it can be extremely frightening. The cast saw also presents a risk of burns to the patient. “Our product does not require that at all. It’s designed so that a physician can take clinical shears, snip through the tabs and pull it open easily. It was designed to completely eliminate the use of a cast saw and make the healing process far more pleasant for the patient.” The device is also faster to apply than traditional casts. Physicians start by measuring the damaged limb using a flexible measuring tape. Once they’ve selected the correct size, they slide a flexible, slightly padded, sleeve onto their patient’s arm. Using a patented liquid pack, the physician then mixes a duo of liquid resins and pours them into the empty sleeve through a valved nozzle. After the sleeve is full, it takes three minutes for the liquid to turn into a malleable gel. The doctor then molds the product to fit the patient’s limb, and waits an additional five to seven minutes for it to completely harden. “Another bonus is that no electricity or water is needed to apply our cast, so it’s very portable,” says the 30-year-old engineer. There is reportedly no pain associated with the device’s hardening, and the exothermic heat it produces could even be beneficial. “It feels soothing,” she added. “It reaches about the same temperature as a hot tub.” While Cast21 hopes to make a splash in the field of orthopedic technology, the innovation is still a work in progress. So far the company only has a forearm model designed in a medium size—but they hope to expand their sizing and create casts for the lower legs in the near future. “The idea is to prove that this technology works… right now, we are past the prototype stage and have a fully functioning model in place for the forearm,” said Hogg. “We hope that this technology can span across the entire body. We are looking forward to having a lower limb model for ankle fractures soon. “We have this radical notion that you can enjoy your healing experience. You don’t need to be restrained from daily activities. I’m from Colorado and I like to go hiking, and the equipment needed to administer our cast is so small and lightweight that hikers and climbers could carry it with them in their backpacks (as a first aid kit). “It also has potential for use in the military and for at-home first aid. 3D printed casts can be very expensive, and the turnaround time is very slow. Our design is almost instant and very portable.” Waterproof, 3D-printed casts are already on the market around the US and Europe, but they can cost hundreds of dollars, and patients can be left waiting days or weeks for the cast to be printed and delivered to them. There is currently no price point associated with Cast21’s product, but the aim is to make it as accessible as possible. “We want it to be competitive, and reachable to a large population. We don’t want this to be a luxury product. We are still conducting research in price sensitivity, and the final cost to the patients will be depending on their insurance and doctor. “Right now, we can treat what’s known as ‘distal radial fractures’ or DR fractures. that’s a catch-all term for any fracture of the radius that occurs close to the wrist. “We are hoping, with more data and feedback from physicians, that they would feel comfortable using this technology after a surgery was required. We are interested in expanding the pilot use of our product in clinics. So we would love for anyone interested to reach out to us for more information.”ÿ11.11.2019ÿRevolutionary New Arm Cast is Waterproof, Breathable, and Itch-Free

The system will give people suffering from epilepsy warning that a seizure is imminent, enabling them to take medication—or alert a friend, relative or medical professional. It had an accuracy rate of 99.6% based on results of electroencephalogram, or EEG, tests that monitored brain signals of 22 patients at the Boston Children’s Hospital. Epileptic seizures can currently be predicted with EEG tests conducted in hospitals or other medical settings, followed by predictive modeling, a process that relies on statistics. The artificial intelligence technology developed at UL Lafayette relies on EEG tests and predictive modeling simultaneously, resulting in earlier and more accurate detection. Dr. Magdy Bayoumi and Dr. Hisham Daoud, researchers in the University’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, led a team who developed the system. Bayoumi said the next step in the process is developing a way to bring the system to people who have epilepsy. UL Lafayette researchers are developing a customized computer chip that could be placed inside a smartphone or wristwatch-like device and synchronized with sensors embedded in headgear similar to a swimmer’s cap. The chip would wirelessly predict epileptic seizures by monitoring brain seizures. “Bringing this technology from a medical setting to everyday life would greatly improve quality of life for people who have epilepsy. There would be a medical benefit for them, and a significant psychological one as well,” he explained.ÿ11.11.2019ÿResearchers Create AI System That Can Predict Epileptic Seizures One Hour Head of Time With 99.6% Accuracy

The first-of-its-kind battery, which was switched on at the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) in September, stores energy generated by 6,000 solar panels that have been installed across campus rooftops. Over the course of the next 25 years, the thermal energy tank is expected to save $100 million in air conditioning costs and dramatically reduce the school’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to school representatives. The innovative cooling system was launched in partnership with resource management company Veolia as just one of the ways that the school is working towards their goal of being carbon neutral by 2025. “USC has a plan to be completely carbon neutral by 2025, which is a challenge to any budget because it requires significant changes to the way energy is captured and consumed,” said USC Chief Operating Officer Dr. Scott Snyder. “So, we really did have to think out of the box, and by forming a partnership with Veolia, we were able to negotiate a 10-year plan that suited us both and delivered major energy savings to the University.” “The system was switched on in September and is now delivering 2.1 megawatts of power and we estimate that we will save more than $100 million in energy costs over the next 25 years,” he added. “Another benefit is that we are able to take our students to visit the system and teach them about innovation and finding cleaner energy solutions for the future.” Last week, the ingenious system was recognized by the prestigious Global District Energy Climate Awards after the school was declared the winner of the “Out of the Box” category for innovative eco-solutions. Veolia Regional Energy Services Manager Andrew Darr said the win reflected nearly four years of hard work and a successful ongoing partnership with USC. “The innovation displayed throughout this project is a testament to both organizations and could only be achieved through an open and collaborative partnership” he said.ÿ11.11.2019ÿThree-Story ‘Water Battery’ Has Already Slashed University's Electrical Costs By 40% in One Month

The Greta Thunberg of recycling, Ryan established his own recycling company when he was just three-years-old—and since then, Ryan’s Recycling has properly diverted over a half million cans and bottles. An international advocate who has appeared on Ellen and many news outlets, the boy from Los Angles became a spokesperson this year for the standardized label initiative, a solution that was introduced by Recycle Across America (RAA) to solve the most serious and costly issue for the industry. The partnership comes at a time when U.S. recycling is facing crippling challenges that can be directly traced to public confusion at the bin, and the subsequent ‘garbage’ thrown in with recyclables. That’s why Ryan went to DC, backing congressional efforts to rescue recycling from life-support and get it back on its feet. There are nine million of these standardized recycling labels already in use in national parks, airports, stadiums, schools, businesses, and on residential bins, thanks to Michelle (Mitch) Hedlund, the founder and CEO of RAA, who designed the labels herself ten years ago using the same common-sense approach that was used to create the road signs Americans rely on daily. These labels have proven to increase recycling levels between 50-100%, while significantly reducing the contamination of trash. RAA, a nonprofit based in Minneapolis, is already funding a ‘Ryan Hickman Grant’ so that free labels can be donated to K-12 public schools across the country. Rhode Island became the first state to adopt a society-wide standardized labeling solution in 2016. Today, with 85,000 labels displayed on bins around the state, the state’s recycling facility has already experienced an 18% reduction of rejected truckloads, and America’s smallest state continues to experience strong demand for its plastics, cans, and bottles. The Appropriation bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives in June, included language supported by both Democrats and Republicans that requires the EPA to submit a national recycling strategy and budget for using the labels to the appropriations committee by the end of February. Republicans backers in the Senate, Senators Rob Portman, Lisa Murkowski, and Dan Sullivan, have already joined Democrats—Sen. Tom Udall and Congressman Rep. Alan Lowenthal—who are all on record as supporting the initiative. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) already held a Recycling Summit last November, and a followup meeting this week that RAA hopes included discussions about the labeling. In February 2020, Rep. Betty McCollum, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, will take the EPA’s proposed strategy and budget to the Committee Members for their approval. “The national recycling strategy is an absolute priority, said McCollum (DFL), who represents St. Paul, Minnesota. “It is environmental and economic madness to fill landfills and incinerators with recyclable materials because of confusion at the bin. Every household, business, school and institution should be using a standardized system to eliminate contamination and increase effective recycling.” A perfect example of the scheme’s success was seen two years ago when the NFL World Championship was held in Minneapolis and RAA labels were plastered on every bin—it became the first ZERO waste game in Super Bowl in history. As for the ten-year-old activist, Ryan is saving all his earnings for college (maybe, rethink that) and to buy a recycling truck. He recently went to NBC to be interviewed and the most exciting moment was discovering the RAA labels already on the Los Angeles studio’s trash bins.ÿ11.11.2019ÿ10-Year-old Recycling Hero Swoops into Capitol Hill to Help Save U.S. Recycling From Collapse

The Nike Air Zoom Pulses were developed and tested alongside healthcare workers at OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, Oregon. Thanks to key insights that were provided by the staffers, the new sneakers address several important workplace challenges of a hospital environment. For starters, the Nike developers coated the laceless exterior with material that makes them easy to wipe down and clean. Since the designers also found that nurses “walk approximately four to five miles and sit for less than an hour during the course of a 12-hour shift”, they improved the mid-sole and heel so that the shoes could be ultra comfortable and supportive while still being secure enough for a busy environment. “The design confronts a range of medical worker-specific challenges,” says the company. “How can a shoe be both comfortable for long stretches of standing and versatile enough to support the hurried movements required in emergency situations? The answer comes through the Pulse’s full-rubber outsole, a flexible drop-in midsole with Zoom Air heel unit and a heel fit so secure, it feels like a soft, snug hug.” The elasticated exterior makes the Air Zoom Pulses comfortable, but easy to take on and off at will, and the rubber soles have extra traction on slippery floors. There are six versions of the shoe which will reportedly be released on Nike’s website on December 7th. Though the company did not disclose the price of the shoes, their typical Air Zoom models retail between $134 to $147 per pair. A portion of the shoe sales will also be donated to the Doernbecher Children’s Hospital.ÿ11.11.2019ÿNike Designs New Sneakers Specifically for Nurses and Doctors Who Have to Stay On Their Feet All Day

Her campaign included persuading the country’s government to cancel 37 mining licences In this remote, unforgiving corner of the world, herders call them “mountain ghosts”. Snow leopards, which roam the steep mountains and narrow ravines of Mongolia, are so elusive that even Bayarjargal Agvaantseren, who has dedicated her life to researching and protecting them, has yet to see one. “These cats are so mysterious. They have a remarkable ability to camouflage themselves,” she says. The teacher-turned-conservationist helped to create the Tost Tosonbumba nature reserve in the South Gobi desert, the world’s first officially protected area specifically dedicated to snow leopards. It is also a model for a reserve that is co-managed by local people, conservationists and the government. Listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, these rare cats are victims of poaching for pelts, retribution killing for livestock depredation and habitat loss – and their number has declined drastically over the past 15 years. Today, only 4,000 to 7,000 snow leopards remain in the wild, with nearly 1,000 of those living in Mongolia. Agvaantseren grew up in a family of teachers in a small northern Mongolian village, but used to spend time in the desert, helping her grandmother tend to her horses, goats and sheep. In the 1980s, while working as a language teacher, she spent time translating for a biologist who was studying snow leopards. “As part of his study, we interviewed local herders, who told us how snow leopards killing their animals was affecting their livelihood,” she explains. “They are so isolated, their lives depend on selling their livestock, so we discussed how to protect both snow leopards and the herders’ way of life. For me, that was the starting point to engage in conservation.” Agvaantseren worked for many years on education and conservation projects with herder communities, before creating the Snow Leopard Conservation Foundation in 2007. The foundation runs research projects and has developed a programme in which local women sell wool handicrafts to provide them with a steady income, as well as a community-driven livestock insurance programme – an innovative way to mitigate animal killing by snow leopards. “The communities manage these programmes themselves, so they can be sustainable,” says Agvaantseren. “Once communities understood better about snow leopards, they stopped seeing them as the enemy, but instead as an integral part of their identity.” Communities stopped seeing snow leopards as the enemy, but instead as an integral part of their identity. But retaliatory killings were not the only threat to the species. Mongolia’s mining industry is booming: minerals make up more than 80 per cent of the country’s exports and the South Gobi desert – the heart of snow leopard territory – has attracted Russian, Mongolian and Chinese companies mining for coal, uranium, copper, gold, oil and gas. In 2009, researchers from the foundation discovered that the entire Tost mountain range had been given away to mining. “The Tost community understood how mining was not just threatening the snow leopard, but their entire way of life,” Agvaantseren says. Representing the community, she met with government officials to advocate that Tost become a federally protected area. She also collaborated with environmental journalists on a mass public outreach drive. In April 2016, the campaign resulted in the formal designation of the 1.8 million-acre Tost Tosonbumba nature reserve. The reserve now protects a core breeding population of snow leopards and, by connecting two national parks, brings the total snow leopard safe habitat to 20 million acres in the South Gobi desert. Thousands of snow leopards once roamed the soaring peaks of Asia. The designation was a major victory, but while monitoring the mining licences’ expiry dates, Agvaantseren’s team realised that new licences seemed to be popping up. “The companies were illegally selling their expiring licences to each other, which automatically extended their validity. This showed us that the nature reserve status was not enough to save Tost.” Undaunted, they broadened their collaboration with conservation specialists, government officials and lawyers, and, in 2018, secured the government’s unprecedented cancellation of 37 existing mining licences. There are now no active mines within the reserve. Today, Agvaantseren works with local people and local government authorities to set up the nature reserve as a model protected area for snow leopards, and to make it sustainable, as there is no government funding to maintain the reserve. It is co-managed by local people, conservationists and the government. Agvaantseren was awarded the 2019 Goldman Environmental Prize for Asia in recognition of her success. It amounts to an extraordinary victory for snow leopards, but also “an example of what local communities can achieve if given the tools,” she says. “Their voices can be heard.”ÿ11.11.2019ÿA force of nature: protecting Mongolia’s elusive snow leopards

Uskmouth Power Station, built in 1959, is soon to become the UK’s largest energy-from-waste power facility. The power will come from specially designed pellets that are made of 50 per cent non-recyclable plastic waste and 50 per cent biogenic material like paper or cardboard. The pellets will serve as a direct substitute for coal, enabling the plant to feed power into the National Grid. “We’re putting 20 years of life onto the power station,” says Cornelius, the chief executive of Atlantis SIMEC. “And we’re providing stable base-load generation, which is what the grid needs to be able to take on more renewables.” Renewable energy generation is stronger than ever. This summer, renewable sources overtook fossil fuels as the main provider of electric power to UK homes for the first time during a three-month period. But there’s still a long way to go to entirely remove fossil fuels from the energy supply and to reach the end goal of net zero carbon emissions. Creating energy from waste solves two problems at once: it provides power without burning new fossil fuels and offers a way to dispose of at least some of the increasing levels of unrecyclable waste we’re accumulating without resorting to landfill. We’re effectively recycling a power station. In its projections for the Uskmouth project, Atlantis believes it can absorb around 10 per cent of the country’s non-recyclable plastic waste each year. Over the 20-year lifespan of the facility, the company estimates it will have diverted a volume equivalent to 46,000 Olympic swimming pools, away from landfill. “The landfill tax rates across Europe and certainly in the UK have gone through the roof, which just makes the production of pellets and using it as a fuel in the circular economy so much more attractive than chopping down trees, which is the biomass solution,” says Cornelius. When the station is up and running, which is planned for 2021, it will be generating an estimated base load of 220MW of power for the national grid – “much bigger than a traditional biomass project which is probably something like 26MW,” says Cornelius. The project is also solving a problem for the utility companies that own coal-fired facilities like Uskmouth across Europe. As governments around the world legislate to shut down coal-fired power generators (in the UK, coal facilities must be shuttered by 2025), firms are seeing their once-lucrative sites rendered virtually worthless. “We’ve got every [company] that’s trying to work out what the hell to do with their coal-fired power stations, waiting to see the results of our conversion,” says Cornelius. “We’re effectively recycling a power station,” explains Bruce Davis, joint managing director of Abundance, an ethical investment platform that is supporting the project. Abundance is working with Atlantis to raise finance for the Uskmouth project, alongside Atlantis’ development of tidal power technologies. “It’s a new technology and we’re excited about that,” says Davis. “We see waste as a particularly thorny problem for the UK. This is a new line of business for Atlantis which helps the company grow all of its propositions. But in the short term it’s also a practical and pragmatic solution to the waste problem.” At the moment, energy-from-waste projects are the best solution that we have available. Generating energy from waste has been the source of some controversy. Critics of projects that involve incinerating waste materials argue the process contributes to air pollution and climate change. However, the Uskmouth plant uses different technology and will help divert waste from incineration. According to Cornelius, the fuel in the pellets – which Atlantis has been developing for 18 months – and the process Atlantis uses keep the overall emissions profile of Uskmouth well within European standards. “We’re not going to stop generating waste. If anything, there’s more plastic waste being generated now than ever,” he adds. Davis points out that Abundance doesn’t support straight incineration facilities, and argues that criticising energy-from-waste projects for not being perfect from an environmental perspective is missing the point. “The bigger goal here is: we have to get to net zero. If you accept that, you then look at the pragmatic solutions and, for me, energy from waste is one of those. At the moment they are the best solution that we have available.” Atlantis Future Energy 2019, which offers a return of 8 per cent a year for five years, has already been backed by Abundance customers to the tune of £1.8m, and remains open for investment until 31 January 2020.ÿ11.11.2019ÿPower move: the coal-fired plant to be fuelled by plastic waste

This summer, in Brazil, wildfires were left to roar across the Amazon, while in the UK, Extinction Rebellion protested en masse but failed to see action on the climate emergency from Brexit-occupied politicians. But there was some good news when the UN announced it had convinced bankers from across the world to commit to investing their money in a way that would have a more sustainable impact. On 22 September in New York, 130 banks signed up to the UN’s Principles for Responsible Banking. Between them, they are responsible for $47tn (£35.7tn) in assets. A six-step plan The six principles, finalised after a year of consultation led by 30 founding banks, offer a framework for how the world’s largest financial organisations can make a more positive contribution to society. Aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as the Paris Agreement, they ask banks to set targets that benefit both people and the planet, and to work with clients and customers to encourage sustainable practices. Signatories are required to provide updates on their progress – making these institutions more transparent and accountable to the environment than ever before – and can be removed if the UN doesn’t think they are taking the task seriously enough. It’s a questionable, but potentially commendable commitment from an industry that has in the UK alone poured more than £150bn into fossil fuels since 2016, according to Dutch NGO BankTrack. Some notable names are missing from the list of signatories – HSBC, for example – and of the world’s 10 largest banks, just three have committed to the UN’s new principles. Anything which might get banks to think in a different way is to be encouraged Others have criticised the initiative as greenwashing – allowing banks to make appealing promises of change to come, rather than any immediate impact. The UN has given banks four years to tidy up their business models. It’s a long time for such an urgent problem. “It’s up to the banks to self-police and implement the spirit of the rules,” Steven Pyne, an ethical investment expert and managing partner at financial advice firm Holden & Partners. “If you’re being cynical, you’d say they would sign up to something like this, because it puts them in a good light. But anything which might [get] them to think in a different way is to be encouraged. The problem with banks is always the lack of transparency and accountability – so if that’s going to be reviewed then that’s positive.” Investing in a greener future For consumers, the tricky part is deciding where best to invest money right now. It’s not easy knowing which banks are doing good and which are just giving the impression they are. A recent report commissioned by Triodos Bank, which was founded in the 1980s and describes itself as “one of the world’s most sustainable banks”, showed that the UK’s biggest high street banks share little information on their customer-facing websites about what their sustainability goals actually are (not one mentions the SDGs, for example), making it difficult to understand exactly where customers’ money ends up. Even when specific commitments are mentioned, they may not be presenting the whole picture. The research discovered that one bank which referenced its sustainability commitments repeatedly on its website had at the same time put £47bn towards financing fossil fuels in the past three years. Who can you trust? Fortunately for those who want their money to do good, the amount of choice when it comes to responsible investments is on the up. Companies such as Triodos are already leading the way when it comes to ethical banking, for example by considering the environmental and social impact of projects it lends to, as well as the financial return. Meanwhile, responsible investing has grown into a $30tn (£23tn) industry, up from $22.4bn (£17bn) in 2016. “It’s a growing area which is gathering momentum,” says Pyne. “More and more clients are switching their portfolios to [ones that are] being ethically and environmentally screened.” Rather than simply avoiding investing in companies that damage the environment, Triodos goes one step further, using a ‘positive screening’ process to find companies that are making constructive contributions the SDGs – for example, developing sustainable food products or offering recycling services. The bank conducts a thorough financial and sustainability analysis on each company it considers bringing into its investment portfolios, looking at the potential economic, social and environmental impact of that business. More and more clients are switching their portfolios to ones that are being ethically and environmentally screened. Likewise, the bank focuses on transparency with its business loans, publishing the details of every company and organisation it has loaned money to on its website. And according to UK watchdog Ethical Consumer, Triodos is currently ranked top for ethical current accounts, as a result of its fully transparent approach to investment and lending. Put simply, this means that instead of contributing to the arms, pesticides or plastic packaging industries, for example, Triodos provides financing to businesses that supply organic food, work in the renewable energy sector, and even arts and culture businesses. In 2018 alone, it has lent £6.5bn to projects across Europe that produce a net positive impact for society ? everything from wind farms in Dundee to affordable housing in Cornwall. Time will tell if big name banks can live up to their commitment to the new UN Principles for Responsible Banking, while ethically minded consumers, businesses and investors are already switching to those banks that are leading the way.ÿ12.11.2019ÿClean money: could a commitment to ‘responsible banking’ make the banks better?

The New York Post reports that the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission — either of which could have investigated the merger — both had concerns about the merger. But the Justice Department already opened a larger antitrust investigation into Google, demanding documents from the company in September. The agency has also announced a wide-ranging probe of large technology companies, focusing on “search, social media, and some retail services.” The FTC was given authority to investigate Facebook and Amazon. Reuters also confirmed that the Justice Department will take the lead in an investigation. Several privacy and consumer rights groups have urged the government to block Google’s Fitbit acquisition. The deal could help Google compete with Apple in the wearable computing market. But unlike Apple, Google’s primary business involves targeted advertising, data mining, and services that manage massive parts of our digital lives. Buying a popular fitness tracking device gives it an even greater store of data. And Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim has hinted that privacy concerns could play a role in any investigation. “It would be a grave mistake to believe that privacy concerns can never play a role in antitrust analysis,” Delrahim said at a conference in November, soon after the acquisition. “Without competition, a dominant firm can more easily reduce quality — such as by decreasing privacy protections — without losing a significant number of users.” Google has been cleared to buy many other companies over the past two decades, albeit with some restrictions added. As public criticism of tech monopolies has grown, the outcome of this Fitbit review could indicate how seriously the Justice Department is actually pursuing limits on large tech companies’ power — and unlike a larger review, it won’t have to deal with undoing mergers that have already closed. But you might still want to delete your Fitbit data just in case.ÿ11.12.2019ÿThe Justice Department will reportedly investigate Google’s Fitbit acquisition
